I've worked it out now
you see from the little microphone there there's a button
it says on mute
and mute means quiet
yeah that's something you're not useta be
and the reason it wasn't recording in Mummy's left ear was because the little mute button was on

I think that's the problem
Thomas

right I'm going to get the piece of toast out before it gets stuck
oh I've made tea and I always like coffee when I'm having eggs
never mind
you won't like this actually but I've made egg sandwiches for Daddy this morning

but I'm not so sure now I've done it
whoops what's that

she did not
AuntieDebbie wouldn't do that
I bet she was cross though with Holly for saying something rude „ wasn't she
well it doesn't matter who started it
what did AuntieDebbie say
I don't think she'd have been very pleased if she'd heard you Thomas
oh right
well make your
dust yeah
well just make sure now you're doing that you eat them all please
because if you keep on touching them nobody else will wanna finish them
you're being good
did you say you've been good

right eat it now
stop messing about
are you having milk or not
right well use your spoon and not fingers
right eat please
right what does this egg smell of

oh

I'm twenty two
do you believe me

oh that's nice
well I believe you then
as you say you're five
forty four
am I
and you're twenty five
and how old s Purdie
is she
hm
what about Daddy
mhm
he might be yes
why did the chicken cross the road
I don't know
wanted an egg
yes it was probably laying an egg for my breakfast
mhm
the eggs are really nice
why don't you try it
is it
if you don't have milk on RickKrispies they don't snap crackle and pop „ do they
oh that's
no Thomas stop it please
pardon
yes but look at the floor
look at the mess
there is a mess
no it's not funny
I do
I am tucked in
it's just I'm bigger than you so I hafta sit further back
my tummy's bigger than yours
well you've got you're sitting on the dining room chair but you've got a booster seat „ haven't you
a a little plastic seat that raises you up a little bit higher
and also because it raises you up it pushes you back a bit more
so you're much nearer the table than me
well that chair you've
you useta have a high chair when you were a baby
in fact at first when you were drinking milk we useta just hold you
nurse you
oh I useta tickle you
and then when you were a little bit older you had
you know your rock a tot
do you remember your rock a tot
you useta sit in there and we useta spoon feed you
and then when you could sit up we useta have a high chair there
right in front of the welsh dresser
and then when you got too big for you high chair we bought this little booster seat
and we useta have straps on it
do you remember we useta hafta strap you in so you didn't fall out
in fact that came with a tray
you see this bit here
you can clip a plastic tray across there so it's like a high chair
oh I don't even know where it is
it's probably in the loft now
but it was really great because that folds flat
so when we went to visit Grandma or I useta take you to Sonia's I useta take the booster seat and then whatever chairs they had at their table we could clip your seat onto it
but then as you've got a bit older you haven't needed the straps
and you can sit really on a dining room chair now but you're so low down that I think we'd better stick to that chair
and you won't you'll only be able to see the top of the table
mhm
yes
no eat nicely
no Thomas
come on table manners
what's the matter with you today
I think you needta go back to bed
pardon
you can sit and laugh
sit and laugh all day through
because you're sitting laughing
well you'll be hungry
then your tummy would hurt
your tummy would hurt because you were hungry
and it would hurt because you'd spent all day going hahaha
because it hurts your tummy muscles when you laugh too much
mhm
eventually when you stop laughing and you eat
I've got to do some ironing today Thomas
mhm
we can have a little play
I've got to do some ironing
we've got to post some letters
we needta go to the shop
and one more play
yes we can do quite a lot of play today
we could
well Mummy's got jobs to do in between
well I do that anyway
I think we could have a little play and then I could say right I needta some ironing and while I'm ironing we could talk
or we could watch something on television
or you can play and tell me what you're doing
and when I go to post the letters you can come with me
well I can't leave you on your own
no
Purdie's out anyway
is who up there
mhm
just the post box
yes
no you can come with me to the post office
when we first moved in Purdie useta come for walks with me
she useta walk all over
I remember going out one day it was really quite hot
it was the first summer I had here with you and you were in your pram
and I pushed you round the estate and Purdie followed and she was so hot she hadta keep stopping for a breath
and you know the people who we call the B who live behind us
she lay on their grass and I carried on walking and got home and she didn't come for ages afterwards and she's never been for a walk since
I think she was so tired
I'm glad really she doesn't come because the road useta worry
but she stuck to the pavement
she just useta follow exactly where we'd been
because when we lived in Didsbury Purdie came for a walk with Mummy every night
when I'd finished work I useta go for a walk and Purdie useta trot with me
oh yes she'd still come
she never crossed roads
she just useta trot behind me
I didn't hafta cross roads
I made sure I went somewhere where I didn't hafta cross roads
and then we moved to here and she useta follow me and then as I say this one hot day
you were born in April so it must have been perhaps June or July maybe August
and I set off with the pram and she came along and never saw her again
she must have decided that day it was too far and she was too hot
I wonder actually
there was
you know when you come up Streetname Drive where the post box is
say you were coming off BurnageLane

right well you come onto Streetname Drive
you've got the clinic on the right hand side
and just before we turn right
you know where we pass Lisa's house on the right and you've got
what's he called
Christopher on the left
and Grace on the left
the house next to Christopher
with the green door
it's still got the green door
useta have a huge dog
they useta leave the front door open and this big dog useta lie half in the house and half out
just watching
he was an old dog
I think he was called Fido
no not PlayDoh Fido with a f
f
like FiremanFred f
f
Fhomas
yes I know you spelt Thomas with a f
I noticed that
the fireman Thomas
you were really clever with your fridge magnets
I noticed that you spelt the word Thomas
well the a
you put the a the wrong way round but it doesn't matter
I turned it round
it's really nice though playing with them
happy Thomas
yeah but I noticed you'd spelt it Fhomas instead of Thomas
but their f looks a bit like a t „ doesn't it
are you cold
you look like you're shivering
do you want your dressing gown sweetheart

you're burping
what do you say when you burp
no
ThomasHenry
sounds like you're saying bird poo not burp poo
oh dear
excuse me
right so I'll tell you about Fido with a f
either he
oh Thomas
listen
Jeannine's listening to this
what will she say
actually she maybe isn't listening to it because the orange light's gone off
oh it's back on again
what a funny orange light
oh off again
if I lean
look at this
if I
you just stand up and look at that
you watch that one with just the green light on
right
I lean forward it's on
I lean back and it was going off
they're both on now

how very strange
anyway
Fido I'm telling you about Fido
Fido useta sit in the entrance to that house half
oh it's gone off again
half in the house half off
look at this
look it's doing it again
oh no
everytime I say that it stops
stop it
stop it
I mean it
stop it now
I'm really getting cross with you
stop it
it isn't funny
it's just silly and rude
stop it
Thomas stop it
I know you like being rude but other people don't wanna listen to you being rude
for that very reason
it's rude
it's boring
it's boring
you're boring me
I don't wanna talk to you when you're being rude
and Fido
it useta sit there
all the cars that useta drive into Streetname Drive it useta look at them
and then it would turn its head slowly and watch them drive round the corner
and you always felt like you were being watched
and Purdie
we went out of front door and we turned left
which way is left
past whose house if we go left
whose house
KieraBart
that's right
so past
now
so
the brown mart
sound like a bear
so went left past Linda and Brian's
and all the way around there
right past here past Kathleen's house
and round this way
so she would have hadta have passed Fido on the corner to get back here and I wonder whether he looked at her and she got far too a bit upset
and you were only a baby and I needed to get back quickly
but I remember coming in the house and being a bit worried that she hadn't come with me
but then a while later she turned up so
but it was
I useta like her coming for walks but I always worried in case she would go on her own
but
yeah oh she's walked on a lead before
we've got a harness and a lead for Purdie
I don't know where I got hers either but when I first got her and she was very poorly she was on lotsof tablets
you know when you're poorly and you feel very sleepy and you don't really know what you're doing
you think so
right
well when we first got her
the vet said because she was quite poorly he said don't let her out on her on because she'll get confused and lost
so he said put her on a lead and so we did and she useta walk on a lead
and then when we useta go and stay with NanaBealby and I useta take Purdie with me because she wasn't familiar with the rounds
well not the rounds but where Nana lived in the village I useta when I hadta take her out I useta put her on the lead the first couple of times
just to get her useta walking around
anyway she's now nineteen years old Purdie so she's not done so bad Thomas „ has she
she's been knocked down before
she has been knocked down
she had broken legs when I met her
we went to stay with NanaBealby once and she ran into a car and broke her leg again
that's why
have you seen Purdie coming downstairs limping
if you watch Purdie come downstairs her right back leg
have you seen
she's always got it up
four paws and one leg up
well that must mean she has five legs
well that's why because her right back leg's been broken twice
and now she's getting old she's probably got some aches and pains in it
you know like arthritis
well it's what Nana has
now when you get old your bones wear out
oh
cheeky
I am worn out but it's not my bones it's you
driving me down
everybody's listening to it
even the boss
probably
Jeannine's boss will be listening to that
and she'll be saying I can't wait for April
when we no longer hafta listen to this little boy being rude
what she's thinking
don't you
will you miss apple when she's not coming any more
we'll still be able to see her though „ can't we
do you think she'll
oh
this is called steel grass
is it just the way it's falling it's made a letter x
has it
oh very good
did you think it was a cross
like an arrow marking for the treasure trail
is that what you're meaning
I know I am
so do you think if we follow that that cross
we'll find some buried treasure
actually it points to the cupboard where the chocolate's kept
haha
that's a pretty good treasure
oh
that looked like Purdie
did you see
was it
did she see us
oh I think she must have been on the bench and jumped down because she's halfway across the grass
oh
look at her face
isn't she cute
ah meow
that's right
doos not poos

are you going to put milk on those and finish them off
you're making an apple pie
are you
well I hope you're going to get eating and get them picked up
I mean it Thomas
no eat properly
eat properly
come on
your table manners are atrocious
yes
no you haven't got any by the looks of it
you useta eat better when you were a little baby
mess
even Purdie's eating better than that
actually talking of biscuits we've got some nice chocolate biscuits in the cupboard
she can't see
I've just put biscuits down for her
oh yes
oh she's having a bit of egg now
I
oh
I fell over her
she turned to walk away and I didn't see her
tell you what eat your breakfast please
that's it
she's eating now
it's a pity she doesn't like RickKrispies
because there's enough on the floor to keep her going for the rest of the day
there's Cornflakes in milk
little saucer with cornflakes
as long as they're really soaked in milk
you know when they go mushy
yeah and lotsof milk
she likes those
it makes her rise and shine in the mornings
she's not had cornflakes for a long time
snuck in
oh look at this
it is „ isn't it
you must have done this at nursery „ did you
an egg
well I think it must have been ShroveTuesday pancake day
because it's a piece of purple paper
paper
paper
purple paper
and on it it's got cut out a white oblong and it says f
flower
and underneath look
you've obviously put some flour on some glue
that
a a picture of an egg a bottle of
milk
and what's that
a pancake
it must have been
I think that must have been MrsParkford rather than MissAshworth
was it MrsParkford
oh
that's cheeky „ isn't it
she jumped
poor Purdie
she's jumped on the rocking chair and I think it took her by surprise because it started to rock
she'll zoom off „ won't she
if she gets to the edge she'll fly across the room
you are giddy this morning
what on earth have you got
I'm glad I didn't give you milk
I don't know what on earth you'd be like
so
so flour egg and milk make a
pancake
well she's already tripped me up this morning
she's as bad as you are
will she
did you like the pancakes when you made them Thomas
no
better not have done
so that's good „ isn't it
a bag of flour an egg bottle of milk and a round brown thing that says pancake
what do you sprinkle on pancakes
Thomas'
sugar
and or syrup
Purdie's gone
and syrup's nicer than
and mashed banana
mashed banana with cream
mm
on a pancake when it's rolled up
very nice
oh well I wouldn't give it to Purdie no
Purdie likes egg and she likes milk
I don't know whether she likes pancakes though
I don't think she's ever had pancake
have you seen how her tail's hanging off that chair
her tail's hanging down from the chair
do you
I'd be surprised if she caught a fish outside I must admit
because we haven't got a pond „ have we
like her collar
look at her nice smart collar
she's showing it off
she knows we're talking about her „ doesn't she
there are things called catfishes
catfish
I don't know
sounds familiar but I don't know
who says you're a dogfish
Doodles
from the Tweenies
oh when have you been chatting to Doodles
when I was on holiday
which holiday was this Thomas
oh Spain
it's funny because when I went to Spain I think you came with me
did you
do you like Spain
are you paying
okay then
you'd better start packing
at least you've got your sunglasses ready „ haven't you
you've worn them out
they're nice these little sunglasses
I'm not sure where we got them from
it might have been Mothercare
somewhere like that but
does it
does it really
oh
now you've got two pairs
you've got a ThomasTheTankEngine pair and you've got these
I think these were the first ones you had
they're all bent
can you see where you've been taking them on and off
you useta look every so funny Thomas because when you got these you were much younger
and you useta wear them with a big hat with teddy bears on it
mhm
have you got black crispies now
mhm
the blue with the sunglasses matches the blue on the bowl
be careful taking them on and off or you'll bang the arms and then they won't fit
look who's having a scratch now
do you
didn't she have a nice brush yesterday
Daddy brushed her all over yesterday
and then last night
tsk
her head and her ears and her neck
because she went out „ didn't she „ and got wet
we came back and we dried her and brushed her and she looks so fluffy this morning „ doesn't she
mhm
she looks really nice
when she jumped on she was soaking wet
she made me feel really cold last night when she got on Mummy
she came running in from outside and straight on my knee soaking wet
but anyway it's fine this morning and she looks okay
she looks really fluffy and nice
you mean a spoon
yes I have noticed
and I'm looking at the mess
Thomas I'm being serious
your table manners are atrocious at the moment
no it isn't funny
because the next time somebody says can Thomas come for tea I'll hafta say no because he can't behave himself at the table
and that'll be a shame
well precisely
other people's houses you seem well behaved
it's just here
it isn't an old house but it looks it
it's like a messpot
a messpots to live in
pig sty „ is it
hm
a bonfire site
no a bomb site
looks like somebody's dropped a bomb and toys have just gone everywhere
and today I think it's RickKrispie bomb
somebody's come in and just gone with RickKrispies
no it isn't nice Thomas
oh I've got to think about what we hafta have for tea as well tonight
what would you like
oh she's getting out of the chair now
she's trying a different chair now
she thought she was too near to us sitting in that other one
she probably thought if I sit here longer I'm going to get RickKrispies all over my tail
no you do not
shh
come on
turn round eat those up
taking forever to have those this morning
come on use your spoon Thomas please
use your spoon please
you're not a dog

oh no Fido actually was Purdie's colors
he was a
now do you know what that is

so I brought it down to wash it
pardon

she's settling down again
mhm
ohgosh I hope there aren't any rats coming in
if there are rats coming in I'm going out

if we've got rats and mice inside Purdie's got to go because she's not doing her job properly
I'd forgotten we were doing this
I'd better look at the time
pressing the sleep button
she's settling down yes
she's making herself comfortable „ isn't she
quite sweet really

I'm going to go and have a shower and get dressed
it's not very warm „ is it „ today
well we can sweetheart but
well we can play for a couple of minutes
I think I'd rather go and get a shower and get dressed actually
I know I'm boring but at least
if anybody comes to the house now and finds us still in our pyjamas what are they going to think
oh but we're not poorly „ are we
we're lazy
something completely different is being lazy
oh do you think she's going to have a wash or do you think she's just
what is she going to do
settle down
ah

right are we finished with these
that's good
just looking for the cloth
