mhm
I can hear another big noise now
what do you think that is

it's an aeroplane Thomas
we saw lotsof aeroplanes yesterday „ didn't we
where did we go yesterday

we left here and we got a train from the station to the airport
then we were able to watch trains at the station „ weren't we
and we saw lotsof aeroplanes going up and landing
and we saw peoples luggage being loaded on „ didn't we
and we saw all sorts of things like cars and police cars
and there was a car transporter
and do you remember that big lorry that was delivering all the chocolate to the chocolate shop
there was a bin bag lorry with a skip
yes
that was exciting „ wasn't it
watching that big lorry lift that skip up
and tip all of the rubbish bags into the back of the bin bag lorry
two big wheels
it had more than two big wheels
it had very big wheels „ didn't it
and then when the man had emptied all the rubbish from the skip he got out of his cab
and he picked up all of the bin bags that were lying on the floor
put them in the skip
and then tipped the skip into the dustbin lorry „ didn't it
didn't he
and we went in a
we went in lotsof lifts

because last year when we went with you you lost one of your shoes „ didn't you
over the railings
when Daddy lifted you up to look at the planes in the sky one of your shoes fell off
and we had a look yesterday to see if we could see it
and we couldn't see your shoe
but we saw a little girl's white shoe
and a little boy's blue shoe
or it might have been a black shoe
because the shoe that you lost was yellow and blue „ wasn't it
I was very sad when we lost it
really upset
I was
and then we went into another lift
and we went into the restaurant and we had
yeah
it was windy „ wasn't it
and we had some chips and a drink
and then we did some shopping
and then we go the train home
and then what did we do when we got off the train
more trains
yes
well we watched a few trains at the station „ didn't we
do you remember the guard gave Ben the ticket
and you were eating orange Smarties on the train „ weren't you
Lynne Ben Charlotte Thomas and Mummy
yes
and then on the way home we called into the baker's
to get some sausage rolls for your tea
to have with some baked beans
and we went to the
I was going to say the Spa shop
but I can't remember what shop it was when we bought some food for Purdie „ didn't we

you have a book about a caterpillar turning into a butterfly „ don't you
a very hungry caterpillar
that was a different book this morning though „ wasn't it
be careful Thomas
please
Mummy's doing all that ironing
is that the train bridge
oops a daisy
Thomas have you got a dirty bottom
mhm
have you
no changing
well I think if you need changing we oughta go and do it
do you not think you need changing
I'm just looking for the rest of your train set
where as the train set gone
here we are
when we go out this afternoon we must remember to come back and take Purdie to the vet
would you like to sit in your chair
that one
that's right
does that go in there like that
do you think it does
oh
well done
more
you're building a bridge „ are you
from wooden blocks
it's a beautiful bridge „ isn't it
and look it as got three tunnels
one goes through there „ does it
like that
you've only got two carriages there Thomas
where's the train engine and the train
here it is
oops a daisy
Mummy was going to wrap Jonathan's present as well
talking of trains
we're going to Jonathan's birthday party tomorrow afternoon „ aren't we
sit down darling
please
you're climbing
big jump
you can sit on the chair
do you wanna sit in your chair
but we're going to hafta change over then Thomas „ aren't we
two trains
well you've got an engine and three carriages „ haven't you
one of the carriages looks to me as if it might be a passenger train
because it as got a door and windows
what do you think this one could be
that could be the buffet car „ couldn't it
because that has windows but no doors
and this is definitely a goods train „ isn't it
that as got space for you to put things inside
I'm just wondering what I've done with Jonathan's birthday present Thomas
I've got the wrapping paper
I wonder if I didn't bring the present down from upstairs
have you been saying a lot of things
you've been talking about the trains „ have you
when Mummy went upstairs to get Jonathan's present so I can wrap that
but when I got
while I was there I might as well get things to change you with
because I think you need changing
what as happened
have you dropped the trains on the floor
don't worry
I'll pick them up
they're lovely trains „ aren't they
there we are
shall we put the end of the bridge there into that box
that can be the engine shed
and then they don't fall onto the floor „ do they
no reach
can you not reach
we'll move it nearer to you
that's why I think you'd be better in the other chair
wouldn't you
here we are
we'll put the other end of the bridge that way
and then as the trains come down the bridge quickly they won't fall onto the floor
we must buy you some more track though Thomas
so that we can build a bigger track
you've dropped it
jump
you've got down from the chair „ have you
big jump
that's very clever „ isn't it
no big jump
right
this is what we've bought Jonathan
a train like yours
I think he'll enjoy playing with that „ don't you
now have you pressed the driver's head to make the wheels spin round
it won't work now while it's still in the box
thank you
thank you Thomas
scissors
they're very sharp „ aren't they
there we are
we've got some sticky tape
some Sellotape
and we'll wrap his present up
do you remember when it was your birthday
and people arrived with presents
it was exciting „ wasn't it
we enjoyed the party
and when everybody had gone home we opened all the presents
I think Daddy probably enjoyed it more than you
yes
I'm sure he did
I think we've the whole sheet of this wrapping paper Thomas
well you can hold it when we've wrapped it
you can hold
and what's on the wrapping paper
the Teletubbies
yes
well I don't know whether Jonathan's into Teletubbies
but his sister Rachael is
so even if he doesn't enjoy looking at the wrapping paper she will „ won't she
I think we could do with cutting a little piece off
I was going to use the whole sheet but
let's cut it on there shall we
just in front of Po's scooter
how does that sound
there
because it's going to be easier wrap if there isn't quite so much paper to play around with
what's going on
Mummy's using the scissors to cut the wrapping paper
now if I
yes
you can watch
why don't you sit down
you can still watch
would you like to hold that piece of paper that we've cut off
and you can tell me what you can see
who can you see
the Teletubbies
have they got big tummys
you are cheeky saying that
yes
they'd be very upset if they thought they had big tummys „ wouldn't they
oh have you gone back to playing with your train „ have you
are you not going to tell me who you can see
is Po on her scooter
Stockport JohnLewis
is that where she's going to
well JohnLewis is at Cheadle Thomas
but you think that's where Po's going
she as been to JohnLewis
and what has she gone to buy at JohnLewis
two moneys
well she'll need some money to shop at JohnLewis „ won't she
but what's she going to the shop to buy Thomas
she's going to buy breakfast
oh TubbyToast
right
so Po's going to JohnLewis
and she's going to go into the restaurant „ is she
and she's going to ask for some TubbyToast
oh that's lovely „ isn't it
and she'll have enough money to pay for it „ won't she
yes
when we go shopping now you hold money „ don't you
you did at Marks and Spencers on Saturday „ didn't you
in fact it was when we were buying this wrapping paper in Marks and Spencers
you handed the money to the lady „ didn't you
and she gave you the bag in return
that's nice „ wasn't it
you like shopping
nice shopping
and who else goes shopping with his Mummy
what about your storybook
do you remember Tom and Pippo
Tom the little boy and his pet monkey or toy monkey Pippo
they go to the shops „ don't they
so when Tom goes to the shop he takes Pippo
because Pippo likes to see the shops
and they go to the cheese counter „ don't they
and Tom asks for a little bit of cheese for Pippo
and the man on the counter gives him a piece of cheese
but Tom doesn't give the cheese to Pippo
he eats it himself
and he did the same at the greengrocer's
with a nice ripe juicy plum „ didn't he
he told the greengrocer that Pippo wanted it
but he ate it
and then Tom and his Mummy and Pippo all went to the cafe for a drink
Mummy had a cup of tea
and Tom had a drink and he said there wasn't enough for Pippo „ didn't he
but then he said he was going to give Pippo some tea when he got home
there we are
we've wrapped that
wasn't too bad „ was it
look
we've got a nice gift tag here
that says TinkyWinky Lala Dipsy and Po
shall we write on it
open the bridge
you're still too busy playing with your train set „ aren't you
you're busy
oh we're all busy Thomas „ aren't we
are we all busy people
but you're very busy really „ aren't you
you're extra busy
because you've got a railway to manage „ haven't you
