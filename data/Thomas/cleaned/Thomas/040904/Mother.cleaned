yes
pardon
well I'm not quite sure what we do with it actually
let's have a look
right we can either do this with it look
can either do that with it
or you can make a cross track one like that
okay
I'm not quite sure how they've done that actually
oh I see
you can put
right let's have a look
how have they done that Thomas

how have they managed to do that
oh I see
that must come on to a piece of track that you've already got
is that what they're saying

that's fine
that's fine
but I can't
just trying to see it from the picture how they can possible have done it
was there nothing else in the box Thomas
oh I see
so you can have a buffer at that end
and a buffer there
I just
that's right
then you put your other train track what you've got already over here
or you can make a long one
okay
you want a train track first
okay well you're very good at building
why don't you build a
oh I'll build some
we saw that in Tesco „ didn't we
another time when we go Thomas we can buy a bit more
but
yes please
yeah
is that how you make a little song
right are you going to stop and we'll get the track out of the box
Thomas are you okay
oh dear
the phone
well when we go another time we'll see if we can perhaps get
some more
I don't think we need more
we'll see when we've made this
we've got the engine shed
so that stops the track there
we've got buffers
you've got two you can make here
what did you say
if Gordon was rushing through
yes
they had like this „ didn't they
they had more of a type ones today
now truck ones
like this one

I thought you'd been drawing on that but I think it must be more the paint off the
Grandad some things to glue with wood
right well let's get this ready because when we find that bit of Grandad could glue this back on „ couldn't he
was it from one of these that we got the turntable
no
look I am helping you
helping you do this piece of something that's missing on these look
because I'm just thinking Grandad or whatever it is he uses
if Grandad could glue that back in then that would mend the track „ won't it
on the phone
it's no good asking can't do it over the telephone „ can he
I don't even know what it's come from though Thomas
ah yes I do
it's from there
right
okay
very good
now do you want it to come round in a continuous
well that's what I mean
so there's no end
that darling
well I'll let you put things where you want
yes
turntable there
no but what I mean is to get the trains
yes
well we've got the engine shed
that block stays off „ doesn't it
that's right
yes
well yes it will do
what do you want it to go under that bridge
you're doing very well actually Thomas
doing very well
that's it
right what do you wanna do
bring it round so it joins on on this end
because there aren't any gaps in the track
you know how we usually have things run off the end
this is going to break darling
it's too stretched there
that's going to break
yes I think we needta use
„ don't you
sorry
I do
I think we need
snapped
there

I think really we could do with a bit of straight track
we keep buying bits but we never seem to ever have enough „ do we
what have you done
oh Thomas
I can't say I had noticed but now that you've pointed it out
oh Thomas Lastname
me
will it not go
stretch
we needta do something else round here Thomas because this isn't going to work
we've got too many
Thomas that smell is absolutely vile
there that's better
great now „ isn't it

right now are you going to put the engine shed on that

it's here look
I'm just thinking if we brought
you need
you needta do
how are we going to do this
we need that to go onto something
we might hafta
that's it
ah yes

do you think we'll hafta turn everything round
is that what we hafta do
goodness me
I think with the rest we'll hafta use something else
on there
not like this idea

we seem a bit stuck „ aren't we
now the trouble is things are going to go flying off there Thomas as well
perhaps what we'll hafta do
is do that and that changes
this probably sounds very noisy building this on a wooden floor
wooden train track on a wooden floor
do you think it's a bit noisy
is it
what's the problem
yes well that's why the other buffer needs to go over there Thomas
that's what I was saying look
it's behind you
but then how are things going to drive over there
look it turns upside down like that
you don't want that there
do you

right
yes
look we've got
it's going to break here I think
it's too „ isn't it
right by the time we've
what's broken
well that's on the end of that piece
put it back in
that's the piece I was saying you've got to save for your Grandad when he comes
haven't you
what's the matter Thomas
well you keep asking me that and everytime I tell you you say it's not going there
so don't ask me anymore
you know where it should go
well it should go on the other part of the buffer
yeah it clicks onto this bit Thomas
that's the idea of it

well that's what I mean
this is where you keep asking me where it should go and when I tell you
well don't ask me any more then
well you turn that piece round and that's where it goes
yes you turn that piece round and put it across ways
like I showed you
oh Thomas stop whinging
well look this didn't come with the set
take that
okay I won't play then
well that's fair enough
I'm sure you can work that bit
that thing „ is it

I know it is but you keep asking me where the buffer goes and I keep showing you
look there's a spider on the floor there
see it
no it's only a tiny spider
are you warm
you feel very warm
that's a good one
well done
well I think you needta join this end up otherwise you're going to have a crash
your trains are not going to be able to join up „ are they
I think instead of that bit curving round there it needs to go somehow out of that
it is a bit tricky

but it's not going to join up „ is it
do you
fair enough
what's the matter
your eye hurts
right
so really we could do with a bit more of the buffer thing „ couldn't we
do you think we could do with more buffers Thomas
oh there's quite a lot to build today
one's
oh join this up
there's no gaps in that track
gaps in the track it doesn't work
right okay
just trying to think where can you go
we've got to join this end „ haven't we
I think it's a little bit too long really
perhaps we needta block it off earlier down there Thomas
in which case we'll hafta take some of the track off there
okay
thank you
it's not
so we've got a double bridge now
that'll work „ won't it
are you sniffing
why don't you go and get a tissue
why are you
are they
haven't got
feel
oh lordy
because I useta think it was quite good to make a train track
and now it's so hard
so very complicated

that best bit to put the bridge „ wouldn't it
do I
guess what
I've got it to work
but the only

and then we
yes well I'm changing all that round
the the only other problem is that I have a cup of coffee which is probably cold by now
watch you don't bump into that because I don't want a burnt leg on top of everything else

right
to move Purdie's bed
Thomas
get off my foot
right
no
no I don't like that
why don't we move this bit over there
oh
no we can't put a over there
no because it won't work „ will it
no
no that Thomas it won't
it's broken at the track
well
there
do you
why are you going to break it up
you're not
you think what
stuck
oh
I am stuck now
I am
well I tried to tell you putting buffers there right in the middle of the track
what
well where are you stuck
this is the most complicated
bit of engineering we've every come across
isn't it
right we'll have to go onto the turntable
because I can't think of any other way
it still isn't joining up to anything Thomas
oh this is hard
buffer there
buffers in the whatsits
whatsits
it reminds me of the ThomasTheTankEngine books
when he gets cross he says oh my wheels and wipers and he says something like that „ doesn't he
oh wheels and wipers
is that what he says
yes and we'll needta put
my windows blingoes
what
what does that mean
I don't know
is that Teletubbies come to play
do you

put that there „ can't we
are you
right
and what do we do with that bit though Thomas
oh well if I'm the train driver the track isn't my problem
what can we do with this
am I
whoops
are you engineering
putting a buffer there
but then what
we don't track any more
do we
oh dear deary me
it's that little bit we needta get Grandad
I didn't even notice that
I don't understand how
we've got a few more pieces so I thought having more pieces would make it easier
no
now Thomas stop it
no if you do that I'm going to sit in the chair and drink my coffee
well trying to drive
do you really want it to go under the bridge Thomas
I think this is where our problem is
have we not got more buffers now
because I just think how are we going to end this
well the next time we go to Tesco then
we've got
get another packet of buffers because that's what we could do with if we could
well the two in the box
that's got stuck
so I think we could certainly do with more buffers because then we could block off that turntable „ couldn't we
and we could block that end off
right I don't think we're going to get a drive anywhere at all on this train track Thomas
hm
we needta perhaps bring it round this way
it's got to go in a loop „ hasn't it
but I can't drive
I can't
I'll hit the buffer
Thomas have you made another smell
that corner then
oh
problem
what sort of one
I know we've lost the carriages „ haven't we
what turn in to reverse and couple
right
okay fine
dediddlydum
oh I'm doing great now
dediddlydum
no
oh dear
oh dear
we had a problem getting over the bridge
right shall I try again
I think it's too long
it's a bit of a strange train this
it's an express train
me carry
that many carriages
right Daddy's going out now Thomas
do you wanna go with Daddy
can you see them
are they

right let's have a look
don't climb too high
well you'll see in a minute when they come
what does it say
oh looks like this light's been going on and off
think the men will wave at you
it isn't the same men
no we don't seem to have the same men
I don't know why
look coming this way Thomas
a different way
you can see his brush and shovel on the side
I didn't know they had a brush and shovel
they don't use it at all
I was just thinking that the next time they make a mess I'll shout use your brush and shovel
we usually get the controls on the other side „ don't we
right you see he could use his brush and shovel now because he's dropped something
it looks like a piece of bread
oh and a packet or something
off he goes
well let's hold on a moment
a tortoise
Purdie „ isn't it
what other one
pardon
oh yes it looks like a tortoise
it's just a bit of it's an old leaf that's gone died
but I know what you mean
it's a big leaf and the way it's sort of turned round
and there's Purdie
did you think that was a tortoise
it looks like we've got a flashing orange light again Thomas
so I'm just going to stand here and watch a minute
I don't know which one it is
let me just turn one of the microphones off
oh it's that one
right it's this one that's the problem
okay so we keep an eye on it
okay right are we going to carry on with this train track
come on don't be silly Thomas
no it keeps flashing on
I'm going to go and stop the tape
okay
I've just moved it round a little bit
I don't know if that'll make any difference but
no it's still flashing
there's really nothing I can do
we either spend the whole hour bothering about the orange light „ don't we
or we play
right I hope you've not been sitting in Purdie's bed Thomas
right do you like this train track now I've sorted it out
it's not a building site
oh fair enough
okay it can be a building site then
do you still want the crane
yes
so I hafta go and climb that
oh well we'd better go and
well we can't
we can't have too many things out Thomas
so so if I just bring that bot Thomas box
is that what you want
well if I bring that bottom
is it not
oh right okay
alright
I find it funnily enough when I was vacuuming
I thought something went up the vacuum but I couldn't work out what it was
and then when I emptied the vacuum cleaner bag I just saw something silver shining and I looked and it was this little hook off the crane
so I though ah
I know what it is now
did you know it had broken
did you know it had gone missing though
oh you didn't tell me „ did you
yes
which character's that Thomas
Rolly
well you've got a
oh no it's a Mixer
it's a Rolly that „ is it
Rolly the steam roller
look at the size of it compared to the mixer
right I'm just trying to
Mickey
is it
oh shush Thomas
no don't make too much noise
Thomas
that's very loud
right there we are
I've managed to tie it back on
are you
so why has the train track suddenly become a building site
I don't understand that
oh I see because one of the wooden rails has got a tiny crack so you decided to turn the whole think into a building site „ did you
oh it's a train track but you need some building machines to repair it
is that correct
I see
you know when you went out with Daddy
just after you'd gone I came back through here
and I thought oh that's what I needta do with the train track
you know we were having great problems trying to fix it up
well that's better now „ isn't it
because we've got two lotsof buffers
and we've got this thing
we've got an engine shed
so there's no bit of the track where a train can come off
it either goes into the shed goes on the turnstile or hits two buffers
but did you alter this bit of it
bit
you altered it
how did you alter it
oh I see
before did I have it joined up to there
doesn't matter though
it looks very good
doesn't it
I'm pleased about that
so what are you doing now Thomas
you're building
what are you building
you're mending a crack
what's the matter darling
what is it
right well that's obviously been holding something together „ has it
oh well don't pull it off
right yes we were using that to mend the front of the truck „ weren't we
very good
yeah it wasn't easy to mend
and I had a real problem with it before
right
oh Thomas
shh
don't make such a lot of noise
right
these are the wooden trees from the train track
right were you clearing the line
I see
I thought you were clearing the line
do you remember that last storm
yes
that's right because you're bringing BobTheBuilder toys out now „ aren't you
Scoop Muck and Dizzy and Rolly too
Lofty and Wendy
is that Lofty
I didn't realize we had one of everything
I mean they're all from different places „ aren't they
it looks as if the the Scoop and the Muck of the same make as they're the same sort of size
the Dizzy's a little bit smaller
and the poor steam roller and Lofty are tiny „ aren't they
Scoop Muck and Dizzy and Rolly too
Lofty and Wendy join the crew
we've got a Wendy I'm sure „ haven't we
I know we've got a tiny BobTheBuilder
Pilchard
we've got a Pilchard
have we got a Wendy
no just a Bob
Thomas
just listen
listen Daddy's just been telling you please
shh
please keep your voice down
look you're being watched through the window
this could be Wendy
wanna
do you wanna let Wendy in
she's really called Purdie but we call her Wendy
come on Wendy
she won't hear you
come on the door's open
perhaps she doesn't wanna come in
she'll come if she wants to Thomas
I think she can see that we're
we've opened
she's
yeah she's coming now
took her a while to realize
here she comes
let her in Thomas
Thomas let her in
hello Wendy
what other characters are there Thomas
there's Spud
who
oh
Thomas
who's Spud
is Spud the scarecrow
and what about the bird
what's the bird called
no it's not called Purdie
I mean on BobTheBuilder what's the bird called
Birdie
Birdie
oh is
it's not called Purdie
I don't think
shh Thomas
right here you are
this crane is mended now
and is that all the characters
what about FarmerPickles
we haven't
we haven't got a FarmerPickles „ have we
or a Wendy
Thomas I'm a little bit worried that the noise of some of these machines will mean that Jeannine won't be able to listen to what we're saying
the noise and the machines especially on a wooden floor
so I built this train track while you were out and we're not even playing with it now „ are we
are we
right okay well what do you want me to do
do they
remember that nice story I read last night about the little yellow digger
and what was the man with the plan
do you remember the man with the plan
what did he keep doing
he did
he had a tea break lunch break
he had a coffee break
he did
a coffee break a tea break lunch a snooze
and then all of a sudden he was a man without the plan because he was there without his plans
and what were they building in the end
you don't remember
splish splash
a swimming pool
that's right
well I'm not breaking the whole thing up
well where can we have this
was this for the end before
okay
will do
if we had one more piece
we could have made another little link „ couldn't we „ there
when you came back with Daddy did you play with Daddy at all
I don't understand this because I thought when I'd made it there weren't any gaps at all
were there some gaps still
I don't know how
do you want me to carry on rebuilding it
goodness me
and do I get any help from BobTheBuilder's
oh
right
they're just any builders „ are they
not necessarily BobTheBuilder
the machine in the way
there you are
how's that
oh no don't bash it Thomas
it really will break
it's very fragile you know
Thomas we don't wanna know that thank you
is your tummy a bit unsettled today
is your tummy feeling a little bit unsettled
well look there you are
we haven't any gaps whatsoever
the only thing is you hafta remember this
where
no what I mean is when trains comes down this bridge it's very tricky
because unless we get it on the right line
they'll end up
oh dear
is that the bit we've not built yet
well this is why we need more of that buffer
the buffer track because we could put something on there
couldn't we
it could be a car park
yes
have we got a sign saying car park
that's a good buffer
I'm sure we've got some signs somewhere
not saying car park but
look what about this caution sign
or a stop sign
what would you prefer
none of them
why not
well that's fine
that's lovely
do you want me to spell the word out car park with the letters
is your tummy upset darling
are you sure
you're clutching yourself
do you need the toilet again
right
yeah
and underground yes
I don't think we had any pieces of track left actually at the end „ did we
that's a pretty good going
are you
which hole
right
oh
Wendy wants in
let me just go and see what Wendy wants
carry on talking to me
Wendy says you're wanted on the mobile
isn't that what Wendy says
when I first started watching BobTheBuilder
all he ever seemed to say was right you lot tea break s over
and when I see Wendy she always seems to be talking on the telephone
does she do other things Thomas
does she do building herself
oh that's very good
pardon
what do you mean Volt and Pingu

do they
oh yes
I don't know whether you remember getting that
we went out for a meal with Alice Rachel and Jonathon to
is it called Brewsters
you know CharlieChalk's place „ isn't it
and they gave
well you got some little toys and that was one of them

yes

well some of the things that you need for the building site to repair the holes
wouldn't trains carry any of that wood
would they
so could we load some of those pieces of fence
oh
oh
well
well that's only because this needs to be just
ah arranged a bit differently „ doesn't it
right we mustn't forget to give that piece to Grandad to glue
ah is that where you hadta alter it Thomas
thought of it
right I understand now
nothing will go under the bridge „ will it
right
oh this is a major problem now because I don't know what to do about that
that's where that needs to be
oh dear
haven't we had some problems building this today
is it
oh yes
so you don't need them moving the train
are they
things can go under the bridge now
oh yes
I would imagine so
yes don't shout

yes that's right
sand and things can come down there „ can't they
yes
well the cement when it's mixed would come down there yes
yes I'm sure it would
what is it actually
I noticed that
what is it Thomas

well I've just come from feeding Purdie and I washed my hands afterwards
I did actually think it could be my hands that were a bit damp
do you think it was
here that crack is turning into a very nasty now
isn't it

would she
do you think Grandad will be able to mend that piece Thomas as well
well this bit that's split quite badly
do you think he would
oh
that's PurdyWendy
oh dear
is she alright
it's a very
oh what on
what's
pardon
what do you mean she stung herself
Thomas what are you talking about
right okay
whereabouts
let's have a look
under her tummy
right what did you see red
whereabouts
let's have a little look
was it bleeding
no
whereabouts Thomas
can't see
you just
right I've tipped her over
now you just try and show me where it was
don't poke her

I can't see anything
she's got
her fur's very matted up „ isn't it
she gets terribly
terribly knotted with her being such a long haired puss
off she goes
did you
well I tell you what it might have been Thomas
you know how Mummy hasta wear a bra
well it might have
Purdie has little things like that as well
Purdie's a lady
only Purdie has six
because
six tummies
so I think that might have been what it was
do you
do you think it might have been Thomas
yes
right there we are
I've made that again
I'm just going to see if I can use that extra piece
but I don't know whether I can
this must be the hardest track I have ever made
and you're not even really playing with it as a train track „ are you
to help mend them
repairs
so machines won't see the crack
right
is there
oh dear
no we do not
well I think we needta the gluing
and then we need that crack repairing
and I can't really find anywhere
yes I can
look at that
right we've used every piece
we'll make that a piece
how's that
that is good „ isn't it
oh well the split till Grandad glues it
well look
I could be a little coming along
hello
is the
hello is the cement dry
oh dear
I was hoping to just jump across the line
are you not
well shall I walk there
oh
do you think he's got footprints in the cement
I know but when he jumped on that bit of platform it all bounced oh up „ doesn't it
which is a bit strange
shh
has he
let's have a look at him
oh yeah
he looks like a naughty little schoolboy „ doesn't he
I don't quite know what he's supposed to be
oh dear
well I hope that fixes properly
sounds like Wendy's gone
oh no she's not gone upstairs
Wendy's still sitting in the kitchen
it's a funny little man
I don't know what he came with Thomas
was it an egg
you know an easter egg or something
was he a toy inside an easter egg
funny little man but we decided that he fitted very nicely into the carriages of the train
so he made a good passenger „ didn't he
yes
okay
yes
yes
I'm just having a little look at Purdie because she's
not Purdie sorry Wendy
Wendy's ready for supper again
do you
oh in a few minutes it will be
we've just got some more things to do first „ haven't we
let me feed Wendy
if Wendy doesn't keep going there'll be nobody to answer Bob's telephone
if Wendy work there'll be nobody to answer Bob's telephone
is that right
oh dear
right
oh is it
right
okay I'm here now
well he's lost his head
you know you told me to cross higher up
I think he was actually knocked down by a train by the looks of him because his head's
his head's fallen off
oh right yes
that's a funny little man
right that definitely came out of an easter egg
I am a mole and I live in a hole
no he's not the mole actually „ is he
the mole's the
I am a mole and I live in a hole
does she
oh here she is
talking of Wendy
hello Wendy
Wendy puss
pussy cat Wendy
oh shh
Thomas no
right on
alright I will
I will
I will
please don't blow that again
it's too loud

right okay
yes alright that's enough noise
sorry what am I sposta be saying
he's laughing because he saw the planks of wood
why is he laughing though Thomas
but why would that make him laugh
oh right
oh well is he not concerned about the other man that's lying with his head come off
or is he not bothered about him
oh that's not kind „ is it
not bothering about somebody who must have been hurt quite badly
who's down there
oh how has he fallen out there
he fell out
oh no
