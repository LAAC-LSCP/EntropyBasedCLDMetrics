I was going to put your little tabard on in a minute
tabard
it protects your clothes
right
because we're going to do some things together
there we are
let's pull you up to the table
now somewhere
in my box of cutters
I'm not quite sure where that is
we've got a cutter to make gingerbread men
and I'm being a bit lazy because we're not actually going to make gingerbread men
because I haven't got the ingredients in that we need
or perhaps I have
but we've got PlayDoh
yes
some of those are very small
and there's another very small gingerbread cutter
they're going to sleep „ are they
the gingerbread men
we've been buying some gingerbread men „ haven't we
in the BakerShop recently
there's a few things I was going to read to you
one is this little nursery rhyme
look
a new nursery rhyme book
look at this
now I the rhyme I know maybe has a little bit different word
I can't speak
words a little bit different from this
but look
well that's rockabyebabyonthetreetop „ isn't it
when the
well we'll read that one first but that isn't the one I was going to read
and look on the same page as
do you know what that man's called
he's a chimney sweep
ah that's not nice „ is it
I've never read that one before

but this is the one I was going to read to you
now look
this is GuyFawkes
now we went to a bonfire „ didn't we
last night
and we just saw the bonfire „ didn't we
we didn't actually see it being lit
it was alight when we got there
so we didn't see the GuyFawkes on the top
but look
a GuyFawkes is a bit like a scarecrow
do you remember the scarecrow song Julian taught you
because often it's head's made out of straw and it's dressed in old clothes
and little boys and girls wheel him through the streets saying penny for the Guy
just to raise a bit of money
a little bit of pocket money
you know like
oh no
you can't
you're too little
but do you remember last week we had
who came round
trick or treating
what's the name of the little boy
Lisa's little boy
Craig
do you remember trick or treat
and we gave him a sweet
but sometimes people get money
it's just something children do to get a bit of money
you don't like me giving Lisa's boy sweeties
no
we'll read that in a minute
well that was Halloween „ wasn't it
that was trick or treat
shall we light the pumpkin candle there
yes
no
you don't want it
well Halloween last week we learnt all about that „ didn't we
with witches and ghosts and ghouls and
and trick or treating
oh dear
two gingerbread men cutters are going to have an accident „ are they
oh dear
look
the little boy's holding a hat out ready to take pennys
and the rhyme is
please to remember the fifth of November
well that's today the fifth of November
I know
you're more interested in rock a bye baby „ aren't you
I know
the apples have fallen off the tree no doubt when the baby and the cradle fell down
so today
can you remember the fifth of November
it's a little rhyme that we say on this night
now we've got in the book
the gingerbread man
and when we've read the book we'll get the PlayDoh out
and we'll do some rolling and cutting
well we'll half read the book then we'll get the PlayDoh out
and I'll read it while you're doing some rolling
this book is calledq
but in actual fact there's another story in the fairy book calledq
I would imagine it's the same one
so instead of using proper gingerbread
yes
we'll just use PlayDoh
did he fall off my shoulder
I don't like her being called the little old woman
it would be nicer to say the lady „ wouldn't it
it is a good idea
so can you see the pictures
gosh what a shock
can you imagine if Mummy opened the oven when we were cooking sausages and one of them ran out
and went out the front door and ran down ShevingtonDrive
oh look
she's running after him
ah not that you've read this before
I was just about to say do you know how I knew you'd read it on Thursday
because when I went to pick you up
this very book was on the floor and I thought I bet you've readq
and Zoe read it to you „ did she
alright
alright
alright
so it's saying they couldn't run nearly as fast he could
very good
no
I'm the gingerbread man
is he
he as seen a fox
and the fox isn't going to eat him you don't think
ah do you know what the fox is hiding amongst
do you know what those flowers are called
foxgloves
we have those in our garden
at least we did have in the summer
gingerbreadcandle
no
be careful with the pages Thomas
do you think the gingerbread man should go with the fox
do you
no
no
oh no
I've not read this story
I don't know

there's a little Kingfisher in the weeping willow tree „ isn't there
look
looking down
Purdie's listening to the story now
look
she as come and sat next to me
no
we haven't
we've turned the pages
you've turned too many pages darling
no
oh no
he's not
he's not
he wouldn't eat him
be careful because listen
Thomas
excuse me
you've just nearly knocked Purdie out with the book
look
so what as happened
the gingerbread man
yes
oh Thomas you sound like the Tweenies
did you enjoy the story
so has Zoe read it to you
oh dear
yes
well I think the story in the other bookq is exactly the same „ don't you
oh Purdie
poor Purdie
do you know what as happened this year
Purdie's going a bit deaf because she's so old and I don't think she can hear the fireworks
no
no
I'm going to get the PlayDoh now
she never useta be bothered with fireworks and then when we moved into this house she started hiding under the stairs on BonfireNight
because she was very frightened
and
you wanna go outside
oh right
you're balling outside
are you scared
PlayDoh
why's it called PlayDoh
well because it's the sort of dough you can play with
well you can in a second
I bought this actually
smell that
oh look
there's a pattern in it already
it looks like somebody as cut a gingerbread man

when we went to DidsburyPark in the summer when it was DidsburyFestival
MissusPlatford had a stall „ didn't she
raising money for OliveShapleyNursery
and one of the things was
we needta roll it first „ don't we
there's your rolling pin
and MissusPaltford had a stall and she was selling things to raise money for the nursery
and one of the things was this really big block of PlayDoh
so I thought that would be nice to buy
because we've got some PlayDoh already „ haven't we
but
this is beautiful and soft
it smells gorgeous
proper PlayDoh smells beautiful
and the gingerbread men that we've bought in the shop
have Smarties for eyes
they have Smartie eyes and a Smartie nose
but thinking about it
button
well I was just about to say they don't
they only
let's have a look at one
they only have Smartie eyes and a Smartie nose
but when Mummy as made them in the past I've used currants
you know like the sultanas that you like
well I've used currants
and I've given them three buttons as well

excuse me
it's a good job it's not proper gingerbread after this sneeze

oh excuse me
look
those cutters are quite different from the ones we have „ aren't they
what do you need
alright
well I think you needta roll it up nice into a big ball
and then roll it out
gingerbread man cutter
what sort of things do you do at nursery
what sort of shapes do you make
are you going to roll it out now and make gingerbread man
there you are
let me roll a little bit
just keep it on the board „ won't you
because we don't want the cloth getting stained
are you alright Puss
so last night we went to Platfields „ didn't we
near where Daddy works
Platfield
it's the big park we went to to watch the fireworks
no
you're just being silly Thomas
I don't like it when you're silly
no
I think you need
yes
the chopping board
well the board
the glass board that we roll on
well you needta roll it a bit more to cut that
because look
the dough isn't quite as big as the cutter „ is it
you need the dough bigger than the cutter
yes
yes
the glass board that you're rolling out on has a picture of Purdie on it „ doesn't it
I don't think Purdie likes sweeties or gingerbread men „ does she
it's quite funny
because when
yes
but I still don't think it's quite big enough
you needta roll it a little bit more
why don't you use the little gingerbread men cutters
and then you'd get a lot of them
when you were a baby you
yes
you'd be about seven months old and we had fireworks
we didn't have fireworks but some people at the back had fireworks
and I held you up to the patio door and showed you out
and you thought it was lovely
the only thing was when we went outside to look at them there was a really big bang and you started to cry
you didn't like that
and the year after you were a little bit older and we stood at the window and watched them
and oh you thought the fireworks were beautiful
well we needta roll it a bit more Tom
don't we
let me roll this little piece
yes

there's plenty of PlayDoh
and you were a little bit happier
yes
you thought they were gorgeous fireworks
and last year I remember we walked out
I think BonfireNight might have been on a Friday
I'm not sure
but it was
we walked out together all wrapped up in our scarves and gloves
and we walked round ShevingtonDrive
near Lynne's house
and we were watching fireworks and we thought it was lovely
and this year we've no plans to do anything
and Lynne said that Ben and Charlotte were going to a bonfire at HarwoodRoad and would we like to go
and we said oh yes please
and then Daddy came home from work and said I've arranged for us to go to Platfields with some people from work
so we had two invitations „ didn't we
yes
ah you're making babies with your PlayDoh „ are you
gingerbread babies
there you are
look at these
now if this was real gingerbread Thomas
we'd be poping it on a baking tray
and we'd put two currants for eyes
one for a nose
and three buttons

we'd pop it on a baking sheet and put it in the oven
and shut the door
and then what would happen
ah
and we'd be running down ShevingtonDrive come back quickly
we wanna eat you
and what would the gingerbread man be saying
stop
and what's he shouting

don't bang it on
don't bang it on the board
you will break the board Thomas
yes
it is
and you were so excited on Saturday tea time you couldn't eat your tea
you wouldn't eat your tea last night
you weren't sick
you just kept saying
every single meal time these days you say you feel a little bit sick
you were so excited
and we went in Daddy's car
and we say lotsof fireworks on the way
we parked at Daddy's work „ didn't we
and we went to the bonfire
and the fireworks were just starting „ weren't they
weren't they beautiful
we were standing under that tree watching „ weren't we
it almost feels sugary this
can you feel sugar
is there a sugar feel to it
and after the fireworks we went to see the bonfire „ didn't we
it looked like the MilleniumDome
it was a great big dome shape
so that was last night
and then today
just after tea we went for a little walk „ didn't we
up BluestoneDrive
gosh it did rain tonight „ didn't it
yes
and we saw loads of fireworks up BluestoneDrive near where Lynne and Ben and Charlotte live
and Matthew's house
they were having a bonfire „ weren't they
and we saw
we could
we went right to the top of the hill and we could look down on OwensPark „ couldn't we
all the way in Fallowfield from the hill where we live
and we could see them
are they
ah gingerbread babies asleep
that's a shame
I don't think it's head should be cut off „ do you
do you wanna do it on this one
poor babies
there's a baby
I was glad to get home tonight though actually darling
because it was pretty wet and miserable
I feel sorry for anybody who as saved the bonfire party till today
because really it is today the fifth of November
and it should be BonfireNight
because a lot of people had partys yesterday
didn't they
don't drop that on the floor Thomas
don't you dare
please keep it on the table because it makes a mess if it gets trodden into the carpet or onto your clothes
put it on the table please
where's the
bring your hand up please
well what have you done with it
what have you done with the bit that you've just put under the table
Thomas
okay
shall we make a pussy cat with this
okay
is it
here you are Purdie
we're making you some friends
it looks more like a chicken „ doesn't it
big bangs like fireworks
yes
which were your favorite fireworks
blue ones
you were a bit frightened by some of the bangs „ weren't you
where you
is this something they've taught you at nursery Thomas
excuse me
I've rolled it out to be a pussy cats body and a pussy cats head and a pussy cats tail and you've just pinched them
it's alright
it's alright
I'll make another one
yes
what's going to happen
ohgosh
I thought that was a pussy cats tail
Thomas is it something they've taught you at nursery about a firework going into your Wellington boots
because Daddy said
that could be a Daddy one and that could be a little one
what are we talking about now
are we talking about big boulders or pussy cats
boulders
oh like ThomasTheTankEngine
yes
oh it doesn't matter about it going really
just keep rubbing the PlayDoh and it
no
rub some more PlayDoh like this
and it'll soon come off
it's just the carpet and your clothes I don't want it pressing into
it doesn't
your hand will wash
have you got a sore finger
oh Poppet
ah darling
okay
you can't play with boulders anymore
oh dear
have you just cut your hand
you've not just done this „ have you
oh at MissusAshworth's
somebody locked you in jail at nursery
when was that
on Friday
Thomas do people hurt you a lot at nursery
what do you mean you can't go to sleep
because your hand hurts
or because you're worrying about things
what are you worrying about
okay
should we put the PlayDoh away
alright
we'll leave the big boulder
perhaps just roll it for a second
or roll it with the other hand
did somebody push you in the tree
Thomas you must tell Mummy when these things happen
or you must tell the teacher
don't let people hurt you darling
when you're playing with other children things are bound to happen to everybody
you fall over
you trip up
a lot of things are accidents
but if something happens to you and it's not an accident and it hurts you you must tell the teacher
somebody must say at least to the child please don't do that
that's not nice
I don't like it
well they might do that to you Thomas
but you must tell them or you must tell the teacher
it's different if you're playing with somebody and it's an accident then that is not fair if the child gets into trouble
because accidents happen
but if somebody's doing something that upsets you or frightens you or hurts you you must say something
okay
who was it that pushed you in the tree
you were posting a penny through something
through the letterbox
does it
is that how you hurt your finger
in the spooky bush
is there a spooky bush
when we go tomorrow
you show me which is the spooky bush please
you seem much happier at nursery recently
you do like it really „ don't you
do you know what this is
oh well it was a pink pig but it's head as fallen off
do you think that's bright
yes
no
no
we just roll them
just it's nice rolling PlayDoh
isn't it relaxing
we saw a lot of pretty fireworks „ didn't we
do you know when Mummy was a little girl
we useta go
we useta walk to the next village
in the middle of the VillageGreen
it was a little bit like PostmanPat this
in the middle of the VillageGreen there would be a great big bonfire
because a good few weeks
yes
oh right
I've just made a doughnut
a rolling doughnut
no
yes
you can't catch me I'm the doughnut man

you can't catch me
I'm a big fat jam doughnut

I could be a sly fox
just let me
you've got a tiny bit of PlayDoh quite near your eye
that's it
yes
oh I could be the big pink pig after the doughnut
oops my head as fallen off

oink oink

some of them sort of crackled
they went crackle
and sort of snappy noises
snappy noises
yes
they weren't all
oh Purdie's looking frightened now
Purdie's more frightened of us than she is of fireworks
can I tell you this story about when I was a little girl
stop sausage man
I'm a sausage man
again
right
can I tell you this little story of when Mummy
we useta walk to the next village
and quite a few weeks before BonfireNight
some boys would come round to the house and he would collect all sorts of things
if anybody had any rubbish
any wood or anything like that they wanted to burn
and the boys would take it away
and then over the weeks they would build a huge bonfire on the VillageGreen
and when it came to BonfireNight we would all gather around the bonfire
and first of all we hadta check the bonfire to check that no hedgehogs had got inside
nothing as got inside that doesn't needta be there
and then you light
and everybody stands round getting warm
and there were lanterns
you know like we saw at Halloween
the lanterns
hello Purdie
would you like to listen to this story
lanterns
oh no
she's not jumping on the table
and we useta drink hot soup
and baked potatoes done in the
bonfire
no
they were beautiful
and sausages
and beefburgers
and we useta eat Parkin
and we useta have treacle toffee
and gingerbread men and toffee apples
and when I think back now I don't know how I

when you were a little boy you went to the StationShop and you thought it's my Mummy's birthday
I wonder what I can buy
oh some sweeties in a container
I'll buy those
is that what you thought
come here you little treasure for being so cute
no
you put PlayDoh on my nose and I will not be happy
no

if you do that at nursery you'd be in trouble
let me give you a kiss for being so nice
oh please
oh well I'm going to make some kiss out of PlayDoh
I'm going to make a kitten for Purdie out of PlayDoh
I wouldn't know how to make a fire engine

your foot's a bit sprinkly
what do you mean
yes
as long as you don't take Purdie's kitten and put that on top of the fire engine because she won't be happy
no
there
do you like my pussy cat with whiskers
has Anthony got a baby brother or sister
yes
yes
excuse me
that's a pussy cat
that's Purdie's kitten
does it look like a dog
sorry
I was just looking at the firework through the window
oh the cat as got on top of the fire engine
oh no

oh yes
thank you
shh
not too loud
there we are
I think I should be holding a pussy cat to cross the road „ don't you
oh dear
pussy cat as hurt her paw now

look love
tree
put the pussy cat in the tree and the fire engine could rescue
there we are
it's going to the tree
this good be a big PlayDoh tree
the little we'll make to be a cat
because if it's a very tall tree the cat's going to look so small
did you notice we saw the birds nest in the tree again
there's a tree
big tree trunk
oh no
hello
is that the fire brigade
FiremanSam
my pussy cat's stuck up a tree

present and
did you say present
did you say present and correct
clever boy
oh yes
is he going to rescue him with his ladders

ohgosh
he as pulled the tree as well
he as got the tree as well as the cat
oh there's the cat
it's alright
well done
oh you're a clever FiremanSam
hello love
well I was just checking what time it was because I
as usual forgot
this could be a tree „ couldn't it
oh no
it's stuck on the tree
ohgosh
I think I better just feed Purdie Thomas
because she's looking a bit unhappy
alright Puss
present and correct
what as happened
oh dear
Purdie you've got food here
I think Purdie just wants a bit of attention because she as crying for food
and she as got some on her plate
are you
do you think pussy cats will be able to read the sign now Thomas
do you think they can
do you think Purdie can read
Thomas

I don't think I have love
I've been out in the kitchen
you have
just sit tight
oh dear
oh I'm sure it was
yes
a big accident
right
careful now
no
don't bang Thomas
just roll
don't bang it please
no
because it's flying in the air
it's getting on the wallpaper
I was just going to look at the gingerbread boy book and see if it was any different
no
he still says
run run as fast as you can
you can't catch me I'm the gingerbread man
that's very strange because he's saying that and yet the story's called gingerbread boy
and they're saying
the gingerbread boy ran down the road as fast as he could until he passed a pigsty
so everybody calls him a gingerbread boy but he shouts
you can't catch me
I'm a gingerbread man
it's exactly the same story
he saw a pig and then he saw a cow
and then he saw the fox
oh what about the horse
there was a horse in the other book „ wasn't there
I can't see a horse in this book
Thomas quiet
of course Purdie as finished because she's frightened by the noise you make
there's a picture of the horse in this book
oh listen at this then
this little bit of the story isn't in the other book
well I that's what she's meaning
buttons on his coat
I think it's the same as buttons on his tummy
are you going to look for the gingerbread boy
a truncheon not a hitter
and then I think the rest of the story is exactly the same
where is all the PlayDoh Thomas
have you dropped that very big bit
okay
have you finished playing with PlayDoh or do you wanna play a bit longer
a bit longer
okay
we can make some other things „ can't we
okay
policeman what are you making
you're making a statue
what are you making a statue from
oh right
I might make a necklace
okay
no
I can't reach it darling
I can't get to it
you look very cute in your policeman's helmet and your tabard
well done
wow
that's a big bit of PlayDoh „ isn't it
let's keep it on the board darling
yes
do you want your chair pulling back in
don't hit it Thomas
please
no
don't hit it
no banging Thomas
but not big bangs
because when you do that
I'm going to make little beads
look
can you see these little beads
excuse me
well you're a fine policeman pinching the PlayDoh from under my nose
excuse me
I'm going to report you
no
I'm not playing if you're going to pinch
there's plenty of PlayDoh
what about sharing
you're always telling me how good you are at sharing
no
I'm not rolling it out for you to pinch
cheeky monkey
you're just cheeky actually
you're cheeky „ aren't you
nonsense

oh bang
that's a big bang
I'm trying to make a necklace and you're spoiling it by pinching
no Thomas
no
these little curls I'm making are like little peas „ aren't they
threading them on a string
they make a very nice necklace
look at that
I can go somewhere really swish in this necklace „ can't I
it's very smart
yes
look
it looks a little bit like

what as happened to sharing
what as happened to sharing
and being nice playmates
no
oh no
if you don't share Thomas
no
you've got to share
no
just be careful
I don't want it going on the floor
Thomas you've got all on the policeman's helmet
I've never seen a policeman with a blob of pink PlayDoh on his helmet
ah
it looks like a big igloo
and do you like this little necklace or bracelet
look at this
I think this is a ring
or it could be a scrunchie for your hair
well not your hair
but somebody's hair
there you are
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with Thomas
oh no
don't put it in your hair
no
not on your helmet Thomas
no
because if you put it on your head and it'll get in your hair
and you'll hafta have your hair cut
no
because listen
I said not on the floor
you're not to be silly with PlayDoh
because Thomas
it makes a mess
it stains „ doesn't it
you can have fun with it but you're not to start throwing it or doing silly things like that
yes
is there any more down there

well that would be good
if you make a really big snowball then I can wrap it back up in the cellophane
and then we can get out hands washed
a large one like Daddy
you mean like one Daddy as made before
or something large like Daddy's large
well Daddy's a big man „ isn't he
you'll be a big man when you're a big man
but at the moment you're a little boy
you're quite a big little boy „ aren't you
if you see what I mean
everybody says oh aren't you tall „ don't they
in a duck pond
