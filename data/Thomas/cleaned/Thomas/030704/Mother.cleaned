right poppet
why
are you going to tip that box out with all the cars
no
don't tip it all out Thomas
we don't need them all out
I can be a ladyman
what's a ladyman
oh I see
I don't think we really needed them all tipping out
it is „ isn't it
right
we'll move the box
we've got out the playmat with all the
there's some things on it which
well I think aeroplanes are sposta go along the runway „ aren't they
at the airport
and then up in the sky
a runport
a runway
a runway at the airport
well the plane might
look
it as got a hospital on it with an ambulance
have you got an ambulance
can you see
right
shall we put the ambulance outside the hospital
well look
there's the fire engine
there's a fire station there
no
don't make a lot of noise with that Thomas
I don't want you to do that
thank you
no
I don't want rubbish
I'm putting the fire station at the fire station
well do you wanna get your dustbin lorry out and play rubbish instead
no
the ambulance is outside of the hospital
the fire engine is outside the fire station
can you see on top of the hospital
there's a heliport
we could put the aeroplane on there
what's the matter
don't come to me with a red face crying
you just get so upset
Thomas we've got the playmat out because you wanted to play with the cars and things
don't get upset
come on
I don't know what's the matter with you at the moment
the slightest thing you're crying
are you not feeling very well
alright
you make a rubbish tip as long as you make it quietly
but I'm going to set up this little track over here
and I'm going to play with all your little cars
don't
Thomas stop it please
you're not to throw things
a pusher
the car's broken you mean
not broked
well I've never see such a big pile of rubbish in all my life
the pile of rubbish has an ambulance a fire engine a helicopter a breakdown truck a cement mixer
it looks like a trailer from your Lego tractor
are you feeling happier now
you think so
it could be
yes
do you wanna get your dustbin lorry
okay
is there anymore track Thomas
please
can you see another piece of track or is that it
right
that's fine
because I've built a very long track up here
oh I'm sitting on a piece here
isn't it
you nearly fell over it
we watched the rubbish men yesterday „ didn't we
do you remember
what do you think goes on this track near this the dustbin pile
I can't talk
ooh
rubbish pile
I couldn't get my words out
I was trying to say dustbin pile
rubbish pile
look
the little post van sits perfectly on this track
what else do you think will fit on the track
this looks a little bit too wide „ doesn't it
the breakdown truck
oh dear
the breakdown truck as met the post van
and one of the racing cars has bumped into the back of it
you want me to be very quiet
no Tom
please don't bash things
it makes too much noise
no
can you see all these cars
oh no
I've forgot to put all the rubbish out and I've got such a lot today
did you say something about helmets
please don't throw it Thomas
just put it down gently
it makes too much noise
oh there's a lot of rubbish
it's all strewn across the street
it doesn't look very tidy „ does it
don't kick
don't kick it all
it can be next to a lady's rubbish can it
oh my gosh
thank you
yes
I'm lining up all the cars
there are an awful lot of cars „ aren't there
look at them all
have you noticed all the race
well most of the racing cars have a little character on the front „ don't they
look
that's a seal
can you have a look and tell me what you can see
that looks like a crab
a sheep
see this little mouse
a little mouse on the pink car
you can certainly be a man to push them
it looks like a big traffic jam to me on the motorway
it looks like everybody's queuing up
perhaps it's Monday morning because that's a busy morning „ isn't it
or friday afternoon
Friday afternoon when people are all trying to leave work early and go away for the weekend
or get home early
everybody's stuck in traffic
beep beep
oh dear
am I at the back of a very long queue
do you know what though Thomas
I'm saying do you know what because you say it so often
two cars in front of me and there's another car like the one I'm driving
and these come with McDonalds „ don't they
so that must mean we've bought four HappyMeals
will it go up and then can we all go through
right
oh dear
I think we've got to get round the bend
that's the problem
ooh
how many cars is it going to let through
this looks like the ramp going up to the car port at Stockport Thomas
you know when we're all queuing
right
we're all queuing to get in the car park „ aren't we
and the barrier goes up
and yes
one car goes through
two cars go through
three cars
four cars
five cars
oh quite a few cars
there must be a lot of space in the carpark
am I driving one car and Daddy's driving another
Purdie
I don't think Purdie could drive a car on the road
oh I don't wanna crash Thomas
you wouldn't want Mummy to crash the car „ would you
you wouldn't
if Mummy crashes the car what do we need
and
who else would needta come
but what about an ambulance or a policecar
no
you're not bothered if Mummy has a crash
would you not want the ambulance to come to check I was alright and not hurt
in this you mean
oh
oh dear
did someone else fly out of their car and land on top of me
oh dear dear
it's a bit of a mess „ isn't it
I think the batterys have gone now „ haven't they
noise now
just a very faint neena there
perhaps it's because I've flown such a long way away
I can just hear the sirens in the distance
it is a funny squeak
I think the batterys have gone
I've not seen some of these toys for a long time
no
do you wanna play on here
not on the road Thomas
please
did they
oh dear
so the ambulance came to pick me up but the ambulance man decided I wasn't hurt
and myself and the other lady that fell have gone in the back of the dumper truck „ have we
oh no
poor Mummy
that's not a very nice way to treat somebody who as been in a crash „ is it
okay
and are you going to be in the car
Apple
oh Apple is in a car „ is she
Jeannine
right
it's a very long queue
who could be in that one
Apple and Dimitra together
Jeannine and Dimitra
well there's Apple in one car with Dimitra
or Apple's recording equipment in the other
the tripod and things
you know the video camera that she brings
is there one car for Jeannine and one car for all the equipment
right
she could be
yes
yes
PostmanPat
isn't it funny there are all these cars and right in the middle is PostmanPat in his van with Jess
right
the barrier is up
can a few cars go through
just two
is this the carpark again Thomas
right
two cars
oops three cars
four cars
yes
what do you mean the man to push them
oh Thomas don't
you're too rough
it could be a what darling
a big
oh grabber
do you mean something with big claws
a machine with big claws
I don't know what they're called
it doesn't matter that I can't remember what it's called
no
oh dear
car
can I be in PostmanPat's van with PostmanPat and Jess
who as got a flat battery
PostmanPat's van
I thought you said something about a flat battery
right
oh no
don't drop them Thomas
you'll break them
you don't needta drop them though
I don't think it's the rubbish tip
I think it looks more like a scrap metal yard
it looks like a place where cars that have been involved in accidents go to be crushed „ doesn't it
oh no
they haven't put Purdie still the car in a crushing machine „ have they
you better get her out quick Thomas
oh here she is
here she is

oh she as jumped for safety on top of the T N T lorry
oh that's nice „ isn't it
after she'd been rescued from the grabber and jumped on the T N T lorry another grabber as come and put her on my knee
would you like to play that again
okay
you can be
yes
I don't understand this bit about a flat battery
does PostmanPat's van breakdown because he as got a flat battery
yes
is it Purdie instead of Jess
I'm sorry
Thomas
what have you been at nursery today
are you going to tell me
are you going to play with Anthony
and Samara
and have you been doing some painting or something
you don't know
you must know
you were there
did you do some painting or some drawing
and did you read a story
and what was the story about
it isn't very nice
that sounds to me like
feefofifum I smell the blood of an Englishman
now what's that
is that JackAndTheBeanstalk
well that's the story „ isn't it
of lazy Jack
who's Mummy asked him to go and buy some butter or something like that
I can't think what it was
and I know he ended up buying a little bean „ didn't he
yes love
and is that the story where the Mummy was very cross with the boy because he'd spent the last of their money on a bean
and the bean
oh the grabber has got hold of PostmanPat's van and Jess and Purdie
okay
right
oh you're not going to get us as well „ are you
and what happened
they planted the bean and it grew into a huge beanstalk
and Jack climbed to the top
and there was a big giant „ wasn't there
and the giant started to run after Jack
and Jack ran down the beanstalk
and did he not chop the beanstalk down
and the giant fell
and then I think Jack and his Mother had all the money from the giant „ didn't they
I can't remember the story
is that the story you've been reading anyway
can you remember it better than I can
Thomas be careful banging these please
no cars
the barriers are open
is that what you're talking about
what
some bricks rolled in
where did the bricks come from
right
was the building being demolished
was it being knocked down
what's he called
Blocken
that's a very funny name
do you know somebody called Blocken
Isabel's Daddy's called Rod
DaddRod
we're going to see Isabel on Friday afternoon
will you look forward to that
yes
gosh that is a big load in the dumper truck „ isn't it
would you like the cement mixer to come
because if you've got a lot of bricks you might need the cement to cement them together
oh policeman's coming now
hello
what's going on here with a lot of bricks
ah
right
okay
the policeman's satisfied
you're not in trouble
helicopter's flying overhead
he's just checking what you're doing
where's the fire engine
the fire engine's behind you
look
and the fireman's watching you „ isn't he
can you see his little light to his helmet
they're all cemented together
are you building a big wall now
oh that's nice
oh well there's lotsof bricks there
BuzzLightyear
you're a winner
and you're going to get a big stick and hit the chair down
where would you like to
why would you wanna hit the chair Thomas
isn't it
building a big hotel
can I live in the hotel or would it be more sensible for me have a flat in a block of flats
well hotels are usually for people to go to on holiday „ aren't they
oh yes
I'm quite happy to live in a hotel
that would be lovely
what are the men doing
it's a very tall hotel
is that like the one in Spain
yes
yes
oh I thought that was the roof of the hotel
you're still putting bricks on top „ are you

excuse me men
is it time to put the roof on the hotel before I move in
because if there's no roof on the hotel and it rains we'll get wet
what a tall hotel
how many storys are there

the front of the T N T lorry
I think it might be in the back of your bicycle
in the trailer part of your bicycle
oh you've found it
I will
when I hear it go I'll say that
you want me to go to sleep
you don't want me to watch
remember you've put it on by turning the cab to the side
okay

turn the lorry part on it's side
look
till it clicks in the little spot
then move it round
there we are
how's that
well just try again
Thomas there's no needta get so upset

they forgot
oh did you not say to them excuse me please
have you forgotten to give me my sweetie

did Anthony have one
and what about Samara
did you say you didn't want one
oh Thomas

they didn't notice you
I find that hard to believe
but you had something to eat and drink at nursery this morning „ hadn't you
did you have some milk
well what have you got round your mouth
you've got some
when I sent you to nursery this morning I'd brushed your teeth and I'd washed your face and hands

MissLansdale said to me this morning
I like Thomas's trousers

you don't wanna help me
what could be a boulder
Tigger one
I don't quite know what you mean
oh Tigger ball

and then what's the betting you come along with your Tigger football and demolish it
is that what you're saying
it's going to be a big boulder
I see

well it didn't go anywhere near the hotel
I'm quite lucky
I'm just finding something to make
oh the hotel's ready

would you like Antony to come and play one day

I don't know
his Daddy must have been at work today I think
I think his Daddy said he works on Wednesdays
he works away on Wednesdays
oh yes
now I haven't built a very tall hotel this time
this is a fairly small hotel
but I think it'll be beautiful
I think it's rather nice
what do you think to that
well I think that's rather nice
I thought it might
oh no
oh dear
he as crushed the ambulance and the fire engine
well I'm building another hotel
I'm a very quick worker „ aren't I
building a hotel so quickly
there we are
that's a nice hotel

I needta just turn the roof round because I realized the roof was on the wrong way
right
there we go
how's that
that's a nice hotel „ isn't it
do you like that one
oh no
oh no
ah ha ah ha
the boulder came and knocked it over and it didn't break
ah ha ha ha
because I might build them quickly but I build them well
do you remember the story about three little pigs
it as broken
don't throw please
alright
you're not to throw them too far away
do you remember the story of the three little pigs
because they each build a house
one built it of straw
one built it of wood
but it was the one that took his time and built it properly with bricks
it was that house that stood up to the wolf „ wasn't it
the wolf came and he blew down the house of straw and the house of wood
but the house of bricks he couldn't blow it down „ could he
a little bit like your boulder then
because I built it nicely
I will
I'm actually building another one now
would you like
two small ones
well if there's two of them you can knock them down „ can't you
both of them
that's right
oh well
the hotels aren't built

one's smaller than the other
there we are
how's that
the boulder from the quarry

please don't wait for me to build this and have an accident „ will you
okay
your boulder's having a walk round „ is it
this is a very fancy hotel
I'll just put the roof on it
just a minute
I don't think this'll take oops so much knocking down because it's not all that steady
there we are
oh just a minute the man might
the man who's putting the television aerial on is standing on the roof of the hotel
oh no
he can see a boulder and he can't get down in time
quick

but the man wants to get off
he can see the boulder coming and he as rung on his mobile phone nine nine nine
quick fire brigade
