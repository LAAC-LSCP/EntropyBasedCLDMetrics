ThomasTheTankEngine as got a little jacket
oh I see
the dustbin man as got a little jacket
yes
I think that's called a jerkin Thomas
it's a little
it's like a tabard that goes over the top of the clothes and it hasn't got sleeves in it
and it's usually made of bright material
it's called fluorescent material
and the man as managing to be seen then when it's dark „ isn't he
yes
I heard a dustbin wagon
and the man collecting all the binbags together waved at you today „ didn't he
look
he's going round now putting clean binbags at people's houses
well I'm not sure whether it's the binmen or
Fred and Rachel have a white van still outside „ don't they
with plumbers and builders after the fire so it might be a noise coming from their house
look
can you see the man that waved at you
he's carrying all those binbags
hello
I've just realized you're wearing your green waistcoat today
that's a little bit like the man's
well that's the joiner or a builder by the looks of it carrying some wood into Fred and Rachel's house
no
I don't think he's a dustbin man
I think he's just somebody walking past Thomas
no
he wasn't wearing a green waistcoat like the others
look
who's that
it's not Ginger
it's Tiddles
Tiddles is looking at Daddy's car
looking to see if there's any dog poo
oh I don't think Tiddles is probably as obsessed with is as you are Thomas
it as probably never occurred to her to look for that
yes
she's sniffing at our heather „ isn't she
we've got some plants in the garden called heather and she's sniffing those
she as seen us
look
and she's looking at us
she's peeping

and hiding
oh look
dustbin men
yes
it's the usual crew this week „ isn't it
last week they were all new
they're still coming a lot earlier than they were before Christmas
hello Tiddles
I think Tiddles is going to jump up onto the window
no
she's not
she's going
she thinks she can get in and she can't
oh Pussy don't jump up because we can't let you in
hm
stop it
stay away
well the thing is at Linda and Brian's house next door she does come in and out through the window „ doesn't she
here she is


hello
nice to see you Tiddles
she wants to know why she can't get in „ doesn't she
Linda and Brian normally open this window and she just walks in
she's having a good look „ isn't she
can you see she as got a little red color round her neck
and she as got a disc
and it says Tiddles and it has got her phone number on
but she as moved away now
I can't really
what does it say
Tiddles four three two
four three two
I really couldn't read the number
oh she as run away now „ hasn't she
yes
bouncing
more a frog
more like a horse
galloping
the trouble is today Thomas
when the binmen come
yes
we're not really going to be able to see them darling
because of the builder's van next door
look
they've hadta put all their bags somewhere else today „ haven't they
they've hadta put the bags somewhere else
and then when they go over to Sue's house we're not going to be able to see them because the van's in the way
right
they're coming now
right
do you wanna stand in the window
you can only do this when Mummy's here to hold you
you can't normally do this
don't breathe on the window otherwise it'll steam up and you won't see
oh Tiddles is back again
look
no
she's not
she's sniffing the number plate on Daddy's car
right
here they come
is it
I know if I'd realized they were coming we've actually got some more things in the bin „ haven't we
we could have put
he was going very fast „ wasn't he
right
I think it was oh the two men this morning
are you going wave
look
he's waving at you
that's it

yes
he as got a hat and he's waving at you „ isn't he
see if he waves bye bye when he goes
oh he as hadta get back in the lorry
he waved though „ didn't he
he was very kind
he must have been pleased to see you
there's a red car there can't get past
right
do you wanna come to this window to see if you can see anything this side
I doubt whether you can poppet because
well you can see he as got his drivers cab open
you might be able to see him when he jumps back in
who do you thin drives
the one with the hat or the ginger haired one
the ginger haired man
right
oh no
yes
it was „ wasn't it
bye bye
no
he as just left two
he as gone to Sue's house now „ hasn't he
do you know what it says on the front of the van
it says
keeping Stockport tidy
yes
he's driving off now
bye bye
well yes
yes
the dustbin man as all gone now „ hasn't he
yes
he's all gone now
the dustbin man
oh you're a dustbin man
a big dustbin man
aren't you
you're a big dustbin man
oh you're my little dustbin man
oh you're a big dustbin man „ are you
you're collecting all the bags
go on then
but they've all got to go back before we go out
promise me
because you're getting very handy at moving all these cushions and then leaving them there
but we've got to go out soon so they need all putting back
okay
well you've got the right outfit on Thomas
because you've got a nice little green waistcoat on „ haven't you
like the dustbin man
only his was made from very shiny material „ wasn't it
yours isn't it „ is it
you're a dustbin man really

what's in the rubbish bags Thomas
that you're collecting
lotsof doggy poos and lotsof dinner
lotsof what darling
lotsof banana skins

if you're looking for your yellow helmet it's here darling
in the box
it's there in the box with the fire engine and your torch
I can hear banging as well
can you hear banging
that's coming from the builder next door
building a chair
no
it's after Fred and Rachel's fire
they've hadta have some work done in the house „ haven't they
and the man's banging in their house but the sound is coming out of their house
into your house because we have a fireplace here „ don't we
and I think the noise is traveling from outside of their house and through our chimney
no
it's not going to Linda and Brian's house
I don't think they'll be able to hear it because they live on the other side „ don't they
hello darling
how are you
you're fine
good
the dustbin man's taking his hat off
well the man who's wearing the hat today
it was a black and white woolly hat „ wasn't it
it wasn't a yellow helmet
I don't think it's part of his uniform
I think he must have just have been feeling a little bit cold and decided he was going to wear a hat
but sometimes they wear little caps „ don't they
we've got to go to Tesco fairly soon Thomas
you see a big snake over there
in the window
oh heavens above
I don't like the sound of that Thomas
mind you when I woke up this morning you were lying next to me and you told me you were a snake
and I said hello Thomas
and you said it's not Thomas
it's a snake
a little
was it a little snake not a big snake
a big snake
oh goodness
you like me
you like my snake
do you
ah
I like you Thomas
the dustbin man's taking his hat off „ is he
looking for more rubbish
I don't think you'll find a great deal of rubbish
if I'd realized the dustbin men were coming as quickly as they were I could have nipped outside with an extra bag for them
he was going fast but even before then Thomas
I didn't think I'd got time
when we realized they were coming I hadn't got time to take the bag outside and get back inside „ had I
before they came
so in a little while we've got to go to Tesco and do some shopping
and then we've got magazines to deliver
and then Daddy's doing some painting and decorating tonight

BobtheBuilder as got a wrapper

come here please because we've got these flowers to put in a vase and you can help Mummy do that „ can't you
well Bob if you'd like to come and have your grapes and help Wendy put some flowers in a vase
yes
Bob can do it as well
no
you don't need your straps just for a few grapes „ do you
because there are so few grapes left Thomas
I might as well wash these and put them in small bowl
and then we next want some they're ready „ aren't they
we chose those flowers together „ didn't we
do you know what type of flowers they are
what are they
green flowers
well they've got green leaves and green stems but the flowers are a mixture of pinky and colors „ aren't they
carnations
there they are
pretty aren't they
they're pink
yes
just going to find some scissors
and we could do with just a little bit more water in the flower vase „ couldn't we
in fact they've come with a little sachet of food
yes
you were naughty in Tesco
well you kept sitting down „ didn't you
you just kept sitting on the floor which wasn't particularly helpful
I didn't mind too much though
you weren't being really naughty „ were you
you were naughty in Tesco
well if that's the naughtiest you get Thomas
I don't mind
now this is flower food
I think it's sposta be a dry powder but it's
it feels as if it's liquid
perhaps they've changed it
so we've put the water in the vase
snip the top of that sachet and we'll pour it in
oh it's a white liquid
but I think it's sposta be a powder
perhaps it as got a little hole in the packet and it as already started to dissolve
are those grapes nice
there we are
that helps the flowers stay fresher for a little bit longer
it said on the packet to dissolve it
do you know what that means
you mix it up with water
there you are
do you want a quick stir
and I needta just cut the ends of the stalks
and when I've done that
BobtheBuilder as finished his grapes
did you enjoy them
good
when I've cut the stem and taken the leaves off at the bottom would you like to put them into the vase
just let me check
a flower vase
there we are
the vase's full of water so be careful you don't pull it over on yourself
there you are
is this good fun
you helped me do some flowers at Christmas „ didn't you
this is the stem or the stalk
no
you must sit down otherwise the water will end up falling over
these are the leaves
and these are the flowers
flower petals
but some of them haven't opened up yet
we call those buds
buds
do you remember when we were having a walk out we were saying there were a lot of buds on the trees
and on the trees when the buds open up there'll be little flowers and their leaves
and then these when the buds open up there'll be pretty petals
can you see the different shades of pink
that's all one color pink
and this one's two colors
the petals are one color
and there's a fine red ring round the top with a different color
yes
there's water in the vase „ isn't there
well you've got to be ever so careful with flowers
they're very delicate
a bit like Grandad
we say Granda's delicate and he's fragile „ don't we
well flowers are the same
yes
you can put it in
yes
wherever you like
yes darling
anywhere there's space in the vase
right
and this is the last one now
it's quite alright
now look
we've got one or two left over
what I'm going to do with those
I'll give you a different vase
a much smaller vase
and we can put those in a smaller vase
and they can stand on the kitchen window so that when Mummy's washing up I've got something pretty to look at
you hold those gently
this vase won't have special flower food in it now „ will it
I don't think it'll have fish in it either
just water „ isn't it
there you are
do you wanna put them in one at a time
oh these look pretty
the ones you've arranged already
aren't they
they're nice
did you enjoy doing that
you're a clever boy Thomas
that saved me a job „ didn't it
that's really lovely
you're a good boy
good boy
so those can go on the mantlepiece
and these can go on the kitchen window sill
thank you
that's very pretty
now we've got all these little bits of leaves and stalks to put in the bin
yes
fish live in water but hopefully out of Mummy's flower vase
now let's just give the bottom of the vase a wipe
they look pretty „ don't they
I'll stand them up there
that's beautiful
yes
and we'll give these a quick wipe
bottom of the vase
and they can stand on the mantlepiece
more like to fall down
yes
you look as if you might fall down if you get of your chair that way
thank you darling
that was a good help
let me give you a kiss
thank you Bob
that was very clever
thank you
you can't get through
it's dark
well it's not been such a pleasant day „ has it
shall we have a look at this book together
are you going to sit there
yes
yes
that's right
is that the page you wanna look at
the one with a fire on the track
which page is it
this one
who's a bit frightened
Gordon
I'm not surprised if there's a fire on the line
it says
wheels
