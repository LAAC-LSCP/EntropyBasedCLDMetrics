and we promised Thomas that he could plant some sunflower seeds when we got some
and believe it or not we went to toddler group this morning and at activity time which Lynne organized we planted sunflower seeds in little pots which we've brought home

are you not going to tell Dimitra where you've been today
oh dear
what's in that big box do you think
what do you think Dimitra as brought for you today
perhaps Purdie would like to talk to you
I was going to just read these books
has it
I think it would love this book
because it as got all sorts in it
it as got trucks
I can see a scarecrow
well it looks like a tractor pulling a trailer full of fruit
is it
well there's a tractor here with a trailer full of fruit
but there is a lorry here it looks as if they're going to load the fruit from the trailer into the fruit lorry
ah
the fruit's in the back of the lorry there
ohgosh
it looks as if the truck as got stuck in the ditch
it has
the breakdown lorry comes
the breakdown lorry in this book's called a tow truck
oh and a forklift truck to lift all the crates of fruit
oh and then a bulldozer because the fruit falls out of the lorry
oh
then there's a digger to help pick it up
and then it goes in the giant dumper truck
gosh
would you like to sit on my knee and we'll have a look at it
yes
oh

oh no
the first time was an accident
Mummy as got a bit of a cold
I haven't really
I think it's more because we've been cuddling Purdie
has it made Mummy sneeze
oh it makes Mummy sneeze if we cuddle Purdie „ doesn't it
this is called Dig and Doug with Daisy
and it's called the trouble with trucks
now you tell me what you see as I'm reading out the story
something strange
Dig and Doug had a job to do
FarmerStubble had asked them to come to MerryweatherFarm as quickly as they could
Daisy went too
oh dear she said
FarmerStubble must be in trouble
whatever the job said Dig we'll get it done said Doug
look
do you remember at toddler group we sang OldMacDonaldhadafarm
and what were the animals
we had a cow a pig and a sheep
and we
and a snotsnot you call them
in this book we can see a cow and a sheep „ can't we
so who do you think that is
which is Dig and which is Doug
you don't know
they've got to the farm
my tractor has broken down said FarmerStubble
and I must deliver these crates to MissusGreen's shop
we'll help you
Doug got the toolbox from the back of his little yellow truck
Dig tried to fix FarmerStubble's tractor but the tractor wouldn't start
oh good said Daisy
we could deliver the fruit in your truck
what a good idea said Doug
Dig Doug and Daisy drove off
just when they reached the end of the drive grr roared the engine
but the truck wouldn't go
oh no we're stuck in a ditch said Doug
and we've got a flat tyre said Dig
he picked up a spanner I'll fix it
but they didn't have a spare tyre
I have an idea said Doug
look
can you see their toolbox
you've got some spanners „ haven't you
shall we just wipe your nose
no
alright
we'll read the end of the story then we'll wipe your nose
Doug phoned for a tow truck
what do you call a tow truck
a breakdown lorry
Doug phoned for a tow truck
but UncleDoug we don't want the fruit towed away said Daisy
she opened the gate at the back of the truck
whomp the crate slid out of the truck and into the ditch
followed by a toolbox a rake a spade and a wheelbarrow
goodness me
what a mess
oh dear
oh dear said Daisy
come on said Dig
he put a crate into the wheelbarrow and started off down the road
I'm taking these to MissusGreen's shop
I have a better idea said Doug
come on Purd
come on
you can listen as well
come on sweetheart
that's it
let's all read the story
yes
don't press down on her
no
come on
there's room for us all
Doug arrived with a forklift
but it doesn't say that
it says Doug arrived with a forklift
is she

isn't that exciting
yes
did her claws dig into your knee when she walked past
don't press down
just gently stroke her
oh she's coming back again
you love her fat ears
oh she's sitting on you

I don't think Purdie as ever sat on you before „ has she
isn't that lovely
oh isn't this lovely
do you think she's enjoying this story
you think so
right
for about the fourth time
Doug arrived with a forklift
Dig and Doug began stacking the crates
don't stack the crates too high Dig warned Daisy
oh
it was too late
crash
down came the crates scattering fruit everywhere
oh dear said Dig
he began to rake up the fruit
I have a better idea said Doug
I still don't know which is Doug
which is Doug
and Daisy's the little girl
that's right
shall we turn the page over
what a mess
look at all this fruit
Doug arrived with a bulldozer
scrape went the bulldozer blade as it pushed the fruit into a big pile
we'll needta scoop up all of this fruit now said Daisy
I'll do it said Dig
he picked up some fruit with the spade
I have a better idea said Doug
look at all that fruit
do you see that Dimitra
you can see it too
I can see it but I can't turn the page over
I wonder what happens next
you got a better idea
Doug arrived with a digger
bumpity bump went the fruit as the metal bucket scooped it up
oh dear said Dig
the bucket isn't big enough to carry all of this fruit to MissusGreen's shop
Doug stroked his chin
Dig scratched his head
ah that's an idea
it says Doug stroked his chin
that's a man scratching his chin
or stroking his chin like that
and Dig scratched his head
so that man must be Dig and that man must be Doug
what should they do now
I have an idea said Daisy
when Dig Doug and Daisy arrived at the shop MissusGreen was surprised to see them delivering her fruit in a giant dumper truck
whatever the job said Dig we'll get it done said Doug
look
a fruit shop
yes
have you enjoyed the story Purdie
just be careful
is she a little chicken
yes
I call her a chicken „ don't I
this is nice
is she
yes
don't pull her whiskers
just think if I was sitting on Daddy's knee we'd have the whole family here „ wouldn't we
it would be Purdie on your knee
you on Mummy's knee
and Mummy on Daddy's knee
it is funny „ isn't it
you love her fat legs
don't put your finger in her ear
no
don't push her down
do you remember that story the other day
don't put your finger in the jelly Nelly
is she
does it feel strange

when you were a baby Thomas
I useta spend hours and hours and hours feeding you in the chair that Dimitra's sitting in now
when you were a baby you'd lie in your Mummy's arms and drink milk
and very occasionally Purdie would come as well
she wouldn't get very close to you
she'd sit on the arm of the chair or lie on the back
but see she likes it when you're gentle with her
when you're not squealing or chasing her or being rough she loves it „ doesn't she
she likes to come and be part of the family
what's that song we know about being nice to pussy cats
you can't remember it
you need a clue
I love little pussy
her coat is so warm
and if I don't hurt her she'll do me no harm
so I'll not pull her tail
nor drive her away
and pussy and I very gently will play
family
yes
we're one big family
Daddy Mummy Thomas and Purdie
and chicken
what a lovely family
the Streetname family
what's your name
Streetname poop poop
that's your address not your name
forty one Streetname
Cheshire
that's right
Purdie lives there as well „ doesn't she
so Purdie when you go out if anybody asks you where you live
what have you got
you've got an idea
is it a better idea than Dig Doug and Daisy had
is it
it's Dimitra's turn
well there's another book somewhere
where's
oh the BobtheBuilder book
I that's not a story book but there might be something in there that
Mummy as just got to go and get a little tablet because she's itching a little bit because of Purdie
I love you very dearly Purdie but not so close
excuse me
mhm
very
yeah
Purdie hasn't got tusks Thomas
she as got whiskers
no
we still haven't found the spanner „ have we
Isabelle has a garage
yes
Thomas
whatever have you done
you've not been rough with Purdie „ have you
you did what
you did something
oh not my Thomas
not my Thomas
you're my Thomas
do you know when I look at your toys you've got a lot of things that were in that story
just look at this Dimitra
oh it
somewhere we've got a tractor and trailer
do you want potty
well I'm going to play with Dimitra
no
well there was a tractor and trailer in that story „ wasn't there
and there was a digger
what else
a breakdown lorry
oh that's nice
and a bulldozer
I think there was a dumper truck as well „ wasn't there
I think he's probably doing something
yes he is
oh Tom
do you want your tummy rubbed
yes
yes
he's going to need changing
I'm being told to go away
I think he first of all said let's ring the fire brigade
and then he was asking you if you remember
Mummy ring the fire brigade
a snake coming in our tummys
oh Tom
oh be careful
don't hurt Dimitra
a post lorry
no Thomas
you don't spit
Thomas
no more

oh dear
Purdie's on fire
oh not at Purdie you don't
no
she's not
no
she's not
Purdie's not on fire
no
yeah
she's running away now
oh did you
that's not nice „ is it
no
if you do that again we're taking it away
well you don't hit people with ropes „ do you
what're you doing
a tug of war
row row row your boat
you're pulling a rope
well that's called a tug of war
isn't it
oh round and round
that looks like you're skipping
be careful
no
Purdie doesn't wanna hold that end
do some skipping and some jumping


steady
no
no
I think he's saying the rope is like Purdie's big fat tail
do you think it looks like Purdie's tummy to you
come on puss
oh she's very
she wants lotsof cuddles today „ doesn't she
Purdie and I will hold this end
she's sniffing it „ isn't she
that's nice

oh

gently
steady
it was an accident
try again
oh be careful
be careful
no
Daddy doesn't allow you to throw footballs up „ does he
no
no
steady
oh Thomas Lastname

bibs and bobs
bits and bobs
Mummy's on fire
I'm a spider
Thomas no
Thomas
no throwing
like a sweetie
please may I have it
oh is there a pink one in there

let's make a little archway for Purdie to go through
there
she could have a collar „ couldn't she
or a bow for her hair
shall we make it into a nice bow
course do
oh look at that
or she could have some new ears
look

is she
or a bow for her neck
or she could put it up there
like that
she could put it up there
ah where's it going
and round there
and down
through
that hole
you look like a coat hanger
and we could go and hang you up there
get that off
is Mummy being silly

you're playing PeepBo
Purdie's wondering what you're doing Thomas
she's wondering what you're doing
aren't you Purdie
there was a nice story today
at toddler group
do you remember the lady reading it out
yes
well could you believe this Dimitra
there's a story called what's that noise
and one of the noises was neena
and the lady reading the book said does anybody know what makes that noise
and nobody including ThomasLastname answered
and I'm quite sure you knew what a neena was
a fire engine
but you didn't say that when the lady asked the question „ did you
were you shy
no
oh yes
that was funny „ wasn't it
we went to a shop last night
a shop we've passed many times but never been in
and we wanted some milk so we called in
and there was a boy who kept staring at you „ didn't he Thomas
and Thomas was very shy
because he was a little bit silly that boy
he shouldn't have done that to you „ should he
the boy in the shop kept making faces at you
and you were frightened „ weren't you
and when we got to the till the lady on the till asked you a question
and I said he doesn't understand
he's not three yet
and they both said oh we didn't realize
he looks a lot older
and I think the boy was sorry though because he scared you „ didn't he
he did things that you might do to a much older boy
Thomas I'm going to do something to you in a moment if you don't sit down
yes
he was a big boy „ wasn't he
he was an older boy
but he shouldn't have made those faces „ should he
and you've talked about it a lot so I think it did upset you
you wiped it off „ didn't you
yes
no
it wasn't fair
but anyway we won't go into that shop again Thomas
unless we really hafta
we'll go to the Spa shop for our milk
or Tesco „ shall we
or Sainsburys
what about Tesco
we normally go to Tesco or Sainsbury and when we run out we go to the Spa shop
and then last night we tried the other shop but we won't go there again
because that boy was a silly boy „ wasn't he
do you see now why Mummy tells you to be nice to children younger than yourself
because sometimes it can be a bit frightening „ can't it
gently
Thomas I won't tell you again
now stop jumping on the furniture
you don't jump on the chairs
Daddy'll be home in a few moments
hey
and if Daddy sees you there will be trouble „ won't there
because he as told you time and time again not to jump
what will Daddy say
what would he say
he wouldn't say it was nice
cheeky
he would not
no
he wouldn't
he wouldn't
I was telling Thomas today that it's three years today since Mummy left work
Mummy left work „ didn't she
to look after her baby
who was the baby
you having a scratch
little one
watch
mhm
that's very strange
that man as
yes
it's the dumper truck „ isn't it
oh
Thomas don't start throwing toys
no
what happened at Isabelle's house
Isabelle was rough and she hurt her Mummy „ didn't she
and she got into trouble
because she was being silly like you're being silly now and throwing things
and Sonia got hurt „ didn't she
she did
Sonia said right that's enough now „ didn't she
what's what noise darling
what noise
oh it's an aeroplane
oh I see
because aeroplanes can sound quite noisy „ can't they
where's the pilot
I think he might be in the box
with the green helmet
are you still tired Thomas
you're going to bite me
oh why are you biting me
you like scaring people
bite your tummy
ah this means Thomas is tired
when his hair goes in Mummy's ears
or rather Mummy's hair goes in Thomas's ears
ah that means we've got a tired boy
a tired snake and a crocodile
have I got to look after a cat a snake and a crocodile
no
you've got an idea
what's
what's in my hair
I hope
oh water
I was going to say I hope there was nothing in my hair
no Thomas
you sit down
it's alright if you're standing behind me for a cuddle
but you don't start bouncing on the chairs and being silly
am I
you shouting help
who do you think s going to help you
MisterMummy

one at the front
one at the back
