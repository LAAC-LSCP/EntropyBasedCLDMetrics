listen
we got a taxi „ didn't we
and we arrived at the nursery
and you went in and there were some other children there
and
you had a little play in the water bath and the sandpit
and you looked around
and I think the most exciting thing for you was washing your hands in the cloakroom using the dryer
do you remember with the teacher
going outside
they had little tractors and trailers and you were riding around
you don't remember
and on the way home we walked home and we went to see Liz
and we had a drink at Liz's house
Liz
Mummy's friend Liz
you know down the cobbled street
you can't remember that either
well we went to Liz's house
she gave us a drink
and you went up into the bathroom with Liz and played with some goldfish in the bath
toy goldfish
and then we walked to the park
a new park we discovered in HeatonMersy
and even Mummy went on the slide
don't you remember that huge blue slide
and Mummy went on it because there was nobody about
yes
that's why Mummy went
well you're going there again in a little while
and then after the park
we bought some sausage rolls and we sat on a bench outside the church

this little booklet that they've sent through the post tells us all about nursery

and some children are playing in the playground
that little girl looks like she's skipping
it tells you all about the names of the teacher and the nursery nurse
and what time you can go

because if the teacher's trying to ask you questions like I'm trying to ask you questions and you don't pay attention I think you're going to get into a lot of trouble
no
it's no good smiling
I think they should get very cross with you
who are you telling to smile
well I'm not very happy Thomas
we've got to fill this form in
I know it's a bit boring but

it's just nice because you go and see other children „ don't you
I'm going to put
has it
it has
it as got three on each side
that means it as got six wheels
that's good „ isn't it
it as got six
oh there's some more questions
oh I'm sorry
I thought we'd finished Thomas
well it says
how many children are there in the family
well there's just you „ isn't there
so that's one
does your child listen when someone is talking to him
it as fallen
oh look at that
it as got a clothes peg on the back
no
yes
if somebody's talking to you Thomas
you do normally listen „ don't you
I don't
but you do
you must have listened to that then
now it's saying
can your child go to the toilet on his own
you can go on your own „ can't you
you go all the time „ don't you
and now it's saying can you take some clothes on and off
are you able to take things like a jumper on and off
pull a jumper on and off
just a minute while I get the telephone
what am I sposta be saying
usual
what he usually does
oh sorry
you're still answering the questions „ are you
typical
I've walked away to answer the phone and you're
right
thank you
not on that form
no
well come and sit down and do it on this page
are you drawing or writing now
writing
okay
so you do like writing
they're asking if you can take some items of clothing off on your own
well you can take socks and pants and trousers off
in fact you can take most things off „ can't you
but I don't think you can put things on very easily
what can you put on
you can put on pants socks
socks and shorts
can you put your coat on on your own
your fleece
oh I see
when you're flicking the pen when the nib comes out that means no
and when it goes back in it means yes
you can put most things on „ can't you
you have problems with shoes though „ don't you
if somebody gives you wellies and shoes and slippers in the right order you can put them on „ can't you
because your shoes have those little velcro straps „ don't they
when you have laces Mummy hasta do them
when you have buckles Mummy hasta do them
now who does your child like to play with
they're asking who you like to play with Thomas
neighbors and friends and adults
who do you like playing with
you like playing with adults „ don't you
you like playing with Nana and Grandad
and Jeannine
and Dimitra
no
don't draw on your legs
but you like playing with friends as well „ don't you
what are your friends called
Sam and James
oh Thomas
now you've broken Daddy's pen
he will be very very cross
you should not have had that
that's it
you can't play with that anymore
Daddy is going to be extremely annoyed „ isn't he
does anything upset or frighten you Thomas
you're upset now because I've said Daddy's going to be cross
yes
that upsets you „ doesn't it
oh your face needn't crumble just because I've asked if you were upset
you needn't pretend you are
what frightens you
everybody frightens you
nobody calls you horrid
no
I'm sure they don't Thomas
I'm sure they don't
just remember if you're nice to people then they're going to be nice back
when we went to the park the other day you said some little boys you're going to fight them „ didn't you
well that's a very very naughty thing to say
what if they'd said okay then we'll fight you
they were much bigger than you
they would have hurt you so much
it's such a silly thing to say „ isn't it
does anything frighten you
does anything frighten you
I did hear that
it was a big bang
you're banging Daddy's shoes together
look at that
what as happened
well it as broken „ hasn't it
you'll ask Daddy to fix it „ will you
right
put those shoes down please
so if we go to the park later
you're not going to say that again to anybody „ are you
pardon
you're going to have some peace and quiet
did you
I think you're a little bit tired today „ aren't you
you've been away
we've been away for the weekend and we got back last night
I think you're a little bit tired
are you tickly
that just makes you giggle „ doesn't it

do you know what I think we're better doing now
I'm sorry if you found that boring Thomas
I'm terribly sorry but sometimes there are going to be things especially as you're growing up that you don't really wanna do but you hafta do
sometimes you can put things off or get out of doing them but most of the time you've got to just do them whether you like them or not
and in the end if you've told nursery what you like and what you don't like I think they'll try and make sure that you do some of the things you like and they don't make you do some of the things you don't like
and when they're asking you if certain things upset you or frighten you that's nice
because if they know it's going to upset you they're not going to make you do it „ are they
I don't know why the dustbin wagon as run over my toe
does it make the dustbin wagon go bumpetybumpetybump
what about Mummy's poor toe
what does it do to Mummy's toe
you're pretending it's a bumpetybumpy
right
has he
no
you're starting to hurt me now Thomas
please don't do that
I think we better have a break now and get some lunch „ don't you
you don't want lunch
right
what are you going to eat if you don't eat lunch
no
you're certainly not going to have sweets Thomas
I mean that
you're not having sweets
you can't just eat sweets
I don't know why you keep asking for sweets because you don't have them here
Nana and Grandad said they didn't give you sweets when you were away
Nana and Grandad told me they didn't give you sweets when you were away at their house
I don't know why they didn't but they didn't
a lot of sweets aren't good for you
they're certainly not good for your teeth
no
you can eat food
we'll have a little break
how's that
yes
pardon
you're having a little rest
no
