oh
yes
oh dear been in the wars „ haven't you
is it
that's a long truck
are you
no
don't bob out through there Thomas
no
what did he want
what's that
what
pardon
you like it when Dad's not so cheeky
what did you want through there
what are they
no
tell me what it is
you've forgotten about it
or you'll forget about it
you will forget about it
okay
right
it's not very warm in here „ is it
now please don't bang too many things down because there's sand on the floor
okay
right
you're playing with lego „ aren't you
what have you got
your lego fire engine
yes
under the real ground there are pipes
water and electricity cables
telephone wires
right
your pipes carry water
yes
you're playing with lego and
and fire engine you've converted
and you've put the train carriages onto the back
and what is usually a hose pipe for the fire engine
we're pretending it's an underground pipe „ aren't we
a water pipe
do you remember that

watch your face with it
on the lego bricks there's a tiny propeller „ isn't there
a little helicopter
which Thomas is now blowing
to make the propellers go round and round
you sound like a train going tuf
right
you're going to wear yourself out puffing like that Thomas
aren't you
excuse me
I've just said not to do that „ haven't I
what's that
only don't press that please
right
that's off your meccano
police car „ isn't it
that's off the meccano police car
it's got in with the lego
thank you
I'll have that please
thank you
yes
is it
so you put your flashing lights on it „ have you
I see
that's a little part of a fire engine as well „ isn't it
but you're pretending it's a computer
what is it you've got
two persons
two people do you mean
two people
one person
two people
yes
that's really strange „ isn't it
so the man who's normally the train driver is sitting in the trailer at the back with the computer equipment and the fireman is sitting in the front
but are we not pretending he's a fire
is he just a lorry driver
he's helping you today
right
when you've got one person it is one person
when you've got more than one it's not persons it's people
okay
what am I talking about
what am I sorting out
these are just little things I thought you could perhaps put in your trailer to carry round but you look as if you've got plenty of things already
yes
is he a a fire engine or a delivery van
he was in a rush „ wasn't he
they're rushing for something „ are they
what are you
oh listen
what can you hear outside
mhm
are you mending somebody's boiler
and that's why you need pipes
let's see
oh you've got lotsof tools in there
that's good „ isn't it
so you could be a real boiler man
don't make too much noise please Thomas
put it in the central heating
right
have you
oh no Thomas
don't keep making noises
what does that say
only I can't find an e
an e
it just says Thomas Lastname
Thomas Lastname
sounds like whiskers Thomas

can't find an e in there
yes
look at this
what was that from
was that a picture

your easter egg
oh right
that's what we've got here
we've got a piece of purple foil with holes punched out and another sort of decorated with it
I see
it was an easter egg was it
what's the matter then
Thomas whisker
well I'll try and spell whisker while you're playing
right
then you can change your name to Thomas whisker which is a bit silly
no
I don't think you should play with that Thomas
is he

Jeannine might be listening to this and she might not want a lot of noise
yes
do you remember Jeannine bought you a reflector
what flector
do you remember on your bike
the blue flashing light
on your handlebars
you're going mmhmq
do you not remember
you do remember
that was a jolly good present „ wasn't it
right
Thomas whisker
good boy
urgh
Thomas smelly
you are smelly

no
I don't want that
please
Thomas that please now
Thomas
thank you
good boy

is it
look
there's enough anyway with that
don't make a lot of noise the floor please
take the roof off or open the roof
MisterPonkey
what's he from
is he from the horse
he's the lego man from the lego horse „ isn't he
MissusWilfy
and what does MissusWilfy look like
have you
what people have you got
do they
but why would they be very scared Thomas
gosh that's quite scary „ isn't it
is it dark under there
and do you think it's very cold under ground or warm
right


what Daddy
looks like he wants to make a cup of coffee
just stay there a minute
he wanted to know where the new jar of coffee was
oh look Thomas
there's a spider's cobweb here
can you see it
here's a big
it might be
oh no
it can't be because I've hoovered since then
in fact I've hoovered in here today but I didn't
might be
I didn't hoover up there I must admit
I've just hoovered the floor and the chairs
oh no
but the last time hoover up there and I shall hafta get the hoover out now to get rid of that cobweb later
right
you've sent the underground
well
oh
is he really
I was just thinking
if
if it's like a bridge
when they're driving underground and they're standing up
I hope they don't bump their heads
right
he's got a hat anyway „ hasn't he
that little red man
well that's
a roof
I see
right
the fireman's wearing his helmet
the little man in the carriage
you say he doesn't need one because he's got the carriage roof
we've got a racing driver with a helmet
oh right
a farmer with a cap and a train driver with a hat
is that right
talking of train drivers
and now there's a train going past
it just says Thomas
whereabouts
and show me where
I can't see it
no
I don't think so „ do you
do you think it's warm or cold underground
very windy under the ground
do you think so
I would be quite surprised if it was because it's all sheltered „ isn't it
could be quite breezy I suppose „ couldn't it
oh yes
so they do
you've made that out of lego bricks
tell you what the farmer looks happy
he's to go hurrah
no
because we've won this
you've won the cup from the racing car
oh well done
and what did you hafta do to win the cup
the bestest and smartest
is that what you all are
open the back boot
you've opened the back of the trailer
no
it doesn't say whiskq
what does it say
what does it say
Thomas
Thomas cat


Thomas cat
I couldn't do that
couldn't find the right letters
I couldn't find the right letters
I couldn't find the right letters to spell whiskerq
I'm sorry
that's alright
I can call you Whisker „ can't I
why are they going underground Thomas
from underground
do you think you get a lot of rubbish underground
yeah
ooh no
I see
so when you say you're underground
you're actually
do you mean you're on the London underground or do you mean you're just in an ordinary train tunnel
no

so are you going down a mine
I see
I think they do have little trains that sort of run along when you're in a mine
I don't know
yes
won't be a magic smell
quite often when you're playing in here with cars
then the wheels make marks on the floor
no
but it just does sometimes and the same with the heels
you know when you walk across the floor
sometimes heels make a mark on the floor
it's called a heel mark
it comes off when I clean
yes
it's just it scrapes along the floor a bit and leaves
that's right
well that train driver still looks very happy because he's got his arms in the air
is he a happy man
he's the farmer „ isn't he
yes darling
who are they all
detectives
they're all detectives or rubbish trucks

all rubbish collectors
ah
rubbish menders
what do you mean
they just go along collecting rubbish from the underground
from underground
right
not from the underground
just from underground
and what sort of rubbish did you think you'd get
crisp packets thrown out of train windows
oh no
naughty boys eating lollies and then instead of keeping the stick in their pocket
or putting it in the bin
put it out of the windows
I see
but did they miss or what happened
or was there not a bin there
there was a bin there
oh no
oh
so there's a big sign that says please put your rubbish in the bin and everybody going past happily threw their rubbish into what they thought was a bin but the bin had been taken away
oh
was there
oh
what color was it
a blue slimy rock
oh dear
it was disgusting and you needed to move it
what was underneath
and slugs
ooh slugs and snails and puppy dogs' tails
slugs and snails
excuse me yawning
that's the rhyme „ isn't it
what are little boys made of
little girls made of
sugar and spice and all things nice
what are little boys made of
slugs and snails and puppy dogs' tails
you're not really made of slugs and snails and puppy dogs' tails
no
thought not
are you made of jelly
are you made of jelly
I thought so
I thought you were a jelly baby or are you made of lego
Misterlegolly
that could be lego and jelly
Misterlegolly
legolly
jegolly
or jello
sorry
no
no
you think somebody's acting magic
I don't know
you think it's Linda or Brian
I'll work some magic later because I'll get a cloth out and I'll wipe it up
it's just a little mark on the floor
it'll come off with a cloth when I wipe it

it will be pretty magic
because it's there now and it'll have gone when I wipe it so that's magic
cleaning
lotsof magic happens in this house
we all eat our meals and make the plates dirty and I magic all the dirt away and get nice clean plates again

wouldn't it be nice if we had a big pile of dirty plates and I just said abracadabraq

poor Mummy
you wouldn't like Mummy as a slug „ would you

so you cuddle up to Mummy and really you get a slimy slug
you wouldn't like that „ would you
don't mess with Purdie's legs Thomas please
I told you
it hangs up
have you got hiccups now
yes

would that hook somehow onto the train
think of a way you could hook that on to the train
I don't know whether it would go on there or not „ do you
no
I don't quite know how you're going to hook that on
I can't think how it would work really Thomas

is there anything from the fire engine it would hook on to

are you alright with the hiccups
think it would hook on to there
I doubt it very much
will the of the chain go
onto a piece of lego „ do you think
okay
you're blowing your lego propeller again
and hope that it's
oh no
that was an even louder hiccup than before
ah Thomas
come and have a sip of Mummy's tea and see if that takes it away
it's not hot
just slowly
have you got some tea
has having a drink worked
oh no
did it hiccup again then
don't go in Purdie's bed please
oh dear
it'll go soon
yes please
does it get very dark
I think we'll keep on then just to guide the way „ don't you
are you taking the propellers with you
doesn't seem to be going round as quickly that now
what's the problem
Thomas don't do that please
no
don't get anything else out tonight please
no
plenty of things
Thomas cat
it's the letter p
I was going to spell Purdie but I can't
because we've so few letters
I've got plenty of letters but not the right ones if I needta spell
you could make traffic lights
look
red
yeah
that's right
yes
there's even an orange one
look for amber
there's an orange one there
that's not the red one
no
this is the orange one
I know but compared to this it's red
I would have said it was orange and that one's quite green
have we got a green one anywhere
that's a square
there's a green there
what does red mean
what does amber mean
wait a minute
slowly
and what does green mean
go
go fast
don't think it means go faster
I think it just means you can go „ doesn't it
stop
wait a minute
off you go
Purdie's got her nose right in that door mat

green
wait a minute
off we go
is it
pardon
what do you mean there's poo there
no
it isn't
what's wrong
needta put the back on „ do you
Thomas be careful
has it got a bit stuck
your hiccups are lasting a long time
there's not much left
be careful because you'll get right to the bottom of the cup

you can drink it all
don't drink right to the bottom because there might be tea leaves Thomas
don't drink over there
that's all the clean ironing
Thomas come away
Thomas come here
Thomas come here
if you spill it it will go all over that clean pile of ironing
has that cured your hiccups
don't think about it
I don't think those but that's the end of the tea now „ isn't it
I'll give you a shock
train's going without you
shush
was that a shock
right
what are you doing now
going underground
putting pipes
where are you putting the pipes
it's what happens
oh dear
the pipe's burst open because there's too much water
oh dear
that doesn't look very good „ does it
what can you see
my toes
those shoes are what I wear in the house
they're a bit tatty those „ aren't they
a bit tatty and torn
they're very comfortable shoes
they're flat shoes and they're ideal to wear inside but there is a tiny hole at the toe „ isn't there
very scruffy shoes
oh dear
do you not do any repair work when you went down
you had to do some „ did you
what sort of repairs are you doing

urgh
that sounds awful
I don't think I'd like to do that
Thomas you would not lick your fingers
you dirtyberty
I don't think so
be careful
Thomas don't
just do it quietly please
looks like the racing car man and the other man have almost fallen into the middle of the picnic table
what's been going on
oh that's right
they've straightened up
why have they both got their hands in the air Thomas
that's what they do when it's home time
they say hip hooray
and do they have their tea when they get home
what are they having for tea
what are they having for tea
sausages and bacon
it's their favorite „ is it
why are we not telling them
you want it to be a surprise
do you think they'll like what they're given
you think so
oh yes
is that the computer man that's holding the pipe
do you think all the way home the men are wondering what they've got for their meal
yeah

you told them roast beef and you hate it

so they like roast beef Thomas like I do
I see
do they not like it either
and so you told them roast beef and they really like roast beef
they're going to be very disappointed „ aren't they
when they get home to find it isn't roast beef
do you
you play tricks on them
I see
and do they think its funny or do they get annoyed with you
that's alright then
it's alright playing tricks on people as long as they don't get fed up with you
and do they play tricks back with you
what sort of tricks do they play
oh Thomas
goodness me that man's gone right into the top
so this is the way home now and you've gone right
he's gone to the top of the tower
as well as being able to see home
do you think he can smell dinner cooking
no
I've just dropped the pot
they'll like that „ won't they
how long have they been at work
twenty minutes
so they've been to work for twenty minutes and they're coming home with great excitement
and having a meal
it's hard to settle them down
they must be a bit like you then when they get tired
Thomas that's not nice
you certainly get a bit louder and a bit giddy when you're tired „ don't you
that's really clever
he's got ladders now to get up there
yeah
I hope he doesn't fall
if he falls can I have his sausages please
because he won't want his sausages „ will he
don't make so much noise
okay
could you pick up that little green bead up please
thank you
it's okay

oh yes
they're just little pegs
little colored pegs
that stick into the board
no
you don't hate pink
think pink to the make the wink
oh no
has he fallen
poor man
has he hurt himself
he's hurt his bottom
it looks like he's hurt his legs
he looks like he hasn't got any legs to me
has he hurt his legs Thomas

did you say late how cruel is that
how cruel was it Thomas

it'd be no good at all
he'd be up there for days „ wouldn't he
down there
oops talking of down there

I've just dropped another of these beads down

no
I didn't thank you
I needta put it away in the box up here
you've built a very good thing there Thomas
you're quite adventurous with your lego „ aren't you
do you enjoy playing with it
yes
what
what do you do when you search up trees
what do you find
golden rubies
gold and rubies or golden rubies
sorry gold
did you say gold and rubies or golden rubies
golden rubies
search up what
search up what
the London eye
the London Eye
this is a fantastic little
do you know what it reminds me of Thomas
you know those very big tall cranes you see
the man in the top there working the controls
moving the arm around
first time I saw one of those
was when I lived in Birmingham and there was this very tall crane and I useta live in a higher building when I was a student
and I was on something like the eleventh floor and my bedroom window looked out on to a building site at one point and the man and his crane was on the same level
I useta watch him in the morning
he'd arrive on the building site
he'd have his hard hat on and he'd get on the outside of the ladder and he'd climb right to the top and then he'd get in his special little box and then he'd work the controls and it would move the lift round
I'd always be so frightened because sometimes in rainy windy days
when he was walking on the ladder on the outside
of his crane the whole crane would be shaking and one day a crane driver actually fell off
I didn't see it happen but one of them fell right down the middle of the crane
I don't know whether he was hurt
I presume he was hurt
I don't know anything about it but I useta think it was frightening but imagine you know when we watch and you see that view of the city centre
imagine that crane driver
would be able to look from his box and see the entire city „ wouldn't he
well yes
I mean one of them fell down
I'm sure there was more than one
I don't mean more than one fell down
I'm sure there's more than one crane driver and that's what your little building of lego reminds me of because the man is sitting right at the top
yes
the man's sitting right at the top of what is normally our train carriage but today he's on a pile of bricks looking round „ isn't he
driving a crane
but they use those cranes an awful lot now to put up modern buildings „ don't they
we watched it all when we watched the flats being built
in Didsbury „ didn't we
you remember that
you're making a crane now

you've really got into lego „ haven't you
you like playing with lego
could you possibly just pass me that please Thomas

it's a very smart crane „ isn't it
look at that
yeah
I didn't see it happen but I think he was either climbing up or coming down and he must've just tripped and fell
he was taken away in an ambulance
I didn't see it happen
I don't know whether he was a little way up the ladder or whether he was all the way up the ladder
I don't know how high
I wasn't there and I really can't remember now
no
it had straight ladders
but I say ladders it wasn't actually ladders
but if you look at those cranes
look at the
because the bit on the ground
is sort of like a truck „ isn't it
but it's the very tall bit that goes up
is actually like scaffolding
and that's where they useta walk
but I think he useta walk inside
there must have been something inside for him to hold onto because you useta see him going up and then when he got to the top in that little cab like you have now
it's got this huge arm on the crane and that was where his controls were and I do seem to remember seeing the man going up with his flask and his box of sandwiches
he useta have a little sack with him to go up there
presumably the man going up that day had sandwiches

I didn't see him fall Thomas
I don't know
what I'll do when I'm next talking to somebody
who was there at the time
I'll ask them if they remember the day the man fell off his crane
oh no
no
they wouldn't have pictures because they wouldn't have a camera and it wasn't planned that he would fall
he just fell
the funny thing was we were watching a program on
the television one night
and it said that these wonderful cranes were being built in Germany
and that they would do marvelous things for building sites and it was about two three months afterwards that we all saw this being
it was a big yellow one
big crane
and we said
and do you know what it did at Christmas
they put Christmas lights
they decorated the cab with twinkly lights
you know like we have in the conservatory
pardon
yes
ours have fallen down
because the Sellotape's worn off

at Christmas it was all lit up in his cab and I think he useta have a big advertising poster on his crane as well
I can't remember Thomas but the next time we go
because usually Manchester city centre usually has big cranes like that
yellow and red ones I seem to remember
we can have a look at the crane and just see if you can see where the man can walk up and remind me to ask somebody „ won't you
what happened
I think Daddy might like to go and see that crane
go and show him what you've done
right
and then I think we shall hafta
start having a bath Tom
I'm sorry it's late and it's
you're going to be too tired tomorrow
watch your
now are you going to just do this song
this is Thomas playing
the light'll go off in a minute
this is your little keyboard „ isn't it
choose one more
the piano will play it first and then you hafta play it and then you must get into bed
very good
go on then
yes
okay
now you get undressed
have a wee and then into the bath please
because it's late
that's fine
okay
right
no
don't play with it now
have your wee please and get into the bath
choose one that we all know
there's a hole in my bucket which one's that one
I want one we know Thomas
okay
don't you wanna play it
Thomas have your wee before you get in the bath
you try please
because it's quite late
pardon
what
how to make wine
we could play that
nice soapy bath
is it nice suddy bath
is that what you said sudsy bath
lotsof suds
don't get it over the side
is the water nice and warm tonight
yes please
if you're making some
what are you
the vineyard
are you the vineyard
are you making wine or are you a shop or cafe restaurant serving the wine
so you're a wine bar „ are you
you don't actually make the wine
you just uncork the bottles
right
okay
and then you serve it to customers „ do you
I see
that sounds good
doesn't it
what do you mean it does if there's women

do you mean all women like to drink wine or it's good if there are women in the restaurant
who wanna drink wine
is it
only ladies can come in and drink wine
that sounds good
I see but only the people who work behind the bar can be men
you can't have men customers
I don't think that would be allowed actually Thomas
I don't think that would be allowed
I don't think you would be allowed to serve only ladies
men drink wine as well
who doesn't
your Dad
he doesn't „ does he
he couldn't come
he does occasionally Thomas
he doesn't particularly care for the taste but just because Daddy doesn't care for it it doesn't mean that all men don't like it
anyway Daddy does drink wine occasionally
hello
could I have a glass of red wine please
have you
well I've heard of white wine and red wine and rose wine which is pink but I haven't heard of blue wine or green wine
perhaps I'll try a glass of green wine please
I'll have a glass of green if I feel alright I might go on to a glass of blue
thank you
okay
what's the green wine made from
it's made from beer is it
I quite like beer Thomas
I like beer
oh is it
oh dear
I don't think I shall have that
women's food
what's women's food
oh I see
women eat lotsof things „ do they
can I
what sort of things do women eat Thomas
oh lotsof things that Barbie's like
what sort of things
yes
oh
oh right
what sort of thing
what sort of things does a Barbie eat
that sounds like marshmallows and sweet sticky things
is it sugary things
I see

tastes like vitamins and tastes like paracetamols
I see
right
I don't think it's a good idea to have Paracetamol in it
Calpol's is childrens' Paracetamol
you like the taste of that when you're poorly „ don't you
mind you if you're very poorly trying to get any medicine into you is awful because you don't wanna eat
when you see a spoon coming towards you you go oh don't want that
but actually paracetamol is very well Calpol is very good for you and you don't mind the taste of it really „ do you
are you
pop open the cork
I can't remember what I had
have I had green and blue
I'll have blue then please
this is a good game
oh
you're thinking of a cheap price
right
what's that
that is a cheap price
I'll definitely have a glass of that then thank you

I think I'd better have something to eat to soak up the wine „ don't you
thank you
yes please
can I just move that glass because I don't want it to
a glass of wine is actually a plastic beaker from the bathroom filled with bath water and the biscuit is the sponge covered in bubbles
thank you
could you just move that please
it was very nice
here's my nine pee
look
there's ten pee
keep the penny change
thank you
it was lovely
haven't quite finished my wine yet though because I'll hafta sip that slowly
you can't just gulp it down
I have
it was very nice
yes please
why is it ready for me
yes please
yes
more like champagne
when the cork's popped on champagne
it goes whoosh
doesn't it
all the froth comes out
lemonade does that and coke
imagine if it's been shaken up
you shouldn't do because that wastes it „ doesn't it
not nice that for whoever opens the bottle
because when it all spills it wastes it „ doesn't it
and if it falls and you get all sticky and horrible
mm that looks very nice thank you
do you serve any drinks that aren't wine
yes
do you know what those types of drink are called Thomas
not wine and beer things like that
whisky and all drinks
that have alcohol in them
oh dear
that's the other word they're called soft drinks
yes please
I'd like a glass for my little boy Thomas please
actually could I have a straw with it as well please because he likes drinking with straws
does it
that sounds good
thank you
yes
yes
brr
I'm listening
what's going to happen
yeah
yeah
it's so dangerous that the van needs to come inside

but it's raining outside
oh right
okay then
that will be a pleasure to eat and drink outside this evening because it's so nice
I hope you get your boiler sorted out
you've just told me it's nice and sunny outside
I see
a funky straw
funky
what's a funky straw
is it
yeah
oh wow that's funky

I've heard of bendy straws but not of funky straws
that's a good word that Thomas
funky
thank you
well I say I have
it was for my little boy Thomas actually
nearly yes
I think he has yes
I think he'd like to take the straw home with him actually
could he have a funky straw
getting a brand new one for him to take home „ are you
that's a funny straw he'll like that
a nice blue one with all bubbles on it
thank you
not yet
no
alright
Thomas have you seen the straw that the man from the wine bar gave us especially for you
look at it
that nice blue funky straw
it's there
you're sitting on it
you're the wine bar man
it's in my bag darling

I left the shop with it
hope I haven't left it on the bus
oh dear
going to have a little tantrum

but if it's such a funky straw and it's brand new he might think ah this looks like a brand new straw
shall we go back to the bus depot just to see
is that what happened

alright
do you think we could perhaps
go back to the wine bar and get it
have we got to go out again
right
come on then
I'm in
hello
I forgot that wonderful straw that you gave me for my little boy
I left it on the table
please is it still there or may we have another one
I think we'd better have a new one please if you don't mind
I can because it's for a little boy
I certainly don't
thank you
there we are
right Thomas
here's your nice straw
please keep it safe
okay
and do you know what Mummy would say
tough

or hard luck
no
we've left it again
and then Daddy's out
what back to the shop
oh no
I wouldn't go back in the taxi to the shop again Thomas
I'd just say well I'm sorry
but we've made two trips
we'll hafta be more careful with things in future
if you don't look after them and lose them then
that's that
can't have them
but then you said that's the wine van mans shop sound
hello
hello
have you got the straw that we left
thank you so much
Thomas was just getting upset and I'd said to him well it's hard luck
if we've left it again we can't make another trip
so thank you so much Mr wine man
the wine man had taken it back with him accidentally
oh dear
