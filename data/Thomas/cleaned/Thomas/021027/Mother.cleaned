you playing with your police car
you'd like to have a go because it's very exciting
it is lovely
yes
who are you today
you're ThomasMiddlename Lastname today „ are you
you're laughing „ are you
right
let's get you changed
pardon
mister devil
are you a little devil
a bit of a devil
oh
you're telling me I'm a bit of a devil
oh well
never mind
oh I was naughty
I climbed up there because I hadta put the microphone somewhere
and you know when we useta have that big cupboard there
the microphone useta stand on top of it
and now we haven't got the cupboard it's not easy finding somewhere to put the microphone
yes
the cupboards have gone to SisterEileen's house
oh no
we're not getting rid of that
that's Mummy's large dresser
we need that „ don't we
for all our pots and plates
cups and saucers and things
and tea
yes
there's a teapot and a coffee pot up there as well
and tomato sauce too
I don't think we've got bottles of tomato sauce in the large dresser Thomas
no
I don't think so
look
could we just put the police car down a minute please
let's just put it down while I get you changed
oh
I put it on the large dresser and you're telling me off for putting it on the wood
because I'll break it
but
I'm a
no
I haven't broken your police car Thomas
you calling me a silly woman
well now you've dropped it
no
I can't get it
no
I can't get it back now
I can't get it back

no
it as gone down the back
well you just lie still while I go and get it
now I tell you off for running your cars along the wood „ don't I
because I say you'll damage it
you holding the powder
but I wasn't talking about
smoke
oh it's just the talcum powder „ isn't it
when you squeeze the bottle
I wasn't running the car along the piece of wood Thomas
I was just sitting it on the wood
and you told me off for climbing up
but I was just climbing up really so that I could put the microphone up there
but I slipped „ didn't I

what's under the police car
I don't think there's anything under the police car „ is there
wheels
right just sit up
just sit up
shall we put this jumper on
we'll put your vest on
we'll put this nice clean vest on
and then we'll put a jumper on top
how does that seem
no
don't touch your nappie with your hand
you feel nice and warm
what's that
oh it's a police car coming
oh Thomas it's getting
was it the lights flashing
you're going to break it
the number of times you've dropped it this morning
you keep dropping it „ don't you
where did you get the police car from
ReverandTim
no
it was from Isabelle's birthday party „ wasn't it
right
let's put your nice jumper on
keep you warm
how's that
well you've dropped it yet again on the floor „ haven't you
lie down
what do you say
that's better
what's that Thomas
it's nothing
it's not anything
it's a police car is it
and what do police cars look for
naughty boys
suppose it could be naughty girls as well „ couldn't it
naughty boys and girls
it's up in the sky
like HaroldtheHelicopter
there you are
how's that
you were a good boy yesterday
you used your potty an awful lot „ didn't you
what's that Thomas
there's no point me saying what's that then
if there's nothing there „ is there
what am I sposta see
oh
well I can see a police car on top of your head
what's that
what's that
is it
it's a police lorry
what do police lorrys have inside
do you think they might be carrying police dogs
we quite often see vans and it says police dogs on the back of the van
so you know what's inside „ don't you
then
is that the noise it's making
if it as got dogs inside of it what do you think it might be doing
going into the police station
but there might be a sound inside that says woof woof woof
if it's full of police dogs
pardon
dirty police dogs
why are they dirty
have they been running across some fields
oh I hope not
I hope not Thomas
that wouldn't be very nice at all „ would it
it isn't
I can't imagine a policeman letting a police dog do that
when we next go out and see a police van we'll hafta have a look on the back to see if it says police dogs
they often have different vans
they're different from police cars and they're different from the vans that pick up naughty people
they're smaller vans
we'll have a look
the police van's for dirty dogs „ is it
the big police vans
listen Thomas
sometimes though policeman don't just pick up naughty boys
well they help people when they're in trouble
so they might well be collecting somebody who as not been naughty
for one reason or another
no
there's no policeman out here today
but sometimes if you've had
say somebody naughty as broken into your house and stolen something
the police car might come to your house
but you've not been naughty
oh if a car slipped on a slug the big police lorry might come and take them away
I don't think cars are likely to slip on slugs „ are they
you sillybilly
well it's possible if you're walking on the pavement and you slipped on a slug and you were a hurt
if a policeman was passing in his car he might very well pick you up in his car and take you to the hospital so that you could see the doctor
well I don't think I slipped on a slug
no
well if you say so Thomas
but I doubt very much whether that would happen
I don't know
no
but if you get lost
if ever you got lost from Mummy and you saw a policeman that would be a really good person to go to
and say I've lost my Mummy
they might wanna know your name and you'd hafta tell them your name
what's your name
and where do you live
say it again

forty one Streetname Drive
not seventy
no not seventy five
oh Streetname Drive
forty one Streetname
Drive
that's right
but you've got to be careful who you give your name and address to
but you could tell a policeman if you were lost
but usually you've got to get to know people a little bit better before you start telling them your name and where you live
but if ever you were lost you could always go to a policeman
and tell him „ couldn't you
my name is ThomasMiddlename Lastname
and I live at forty one Streetname Drive
please ring my Mummy
and get her to come to the police station and pick me up
you could say that „ couldn't you
and if they asked you how old you were what would you tell them
yes
and if they said how old are you Thomas
what would you say
yes
and how old are you
no
that's who are you
how old are you
are you two or are you three
you're not three yet
when are you three
you're going to school
when are you three Thomas
at your children's party you'll be three „ will you
you'll be three in April
there on the third of April
won't you
the police car is flying now „ is he
police have helicopters Thomas
you know sometimes the police helicopter wakes you up at night when it whirrs overhead
it's like HaroldtheHelicopter „ isn't it
well it might be looking for naughty boys
or sometimes if there as been an accident the police helicopter stands overhead and flashes a light down so they've got some light
so that the people rescuing the people that are hurt can see what they're doing
well if a big crocodile bit my tummy I'd be quite glad to see a policeman
are you going to sit down while I put your slippers on
you're better now „ are you
after the crocodile as bitten your tummy
let's just put your slippers on please Thomas
the police car's telling a story
or the police car as told a story
what did you say
who as got a friend called Toby
I can't
Thomas I can't hear what you're saying
please don't
ThomasTheTankEngine character as got Toby
Toby on a wall
why is Toby on a wall
I'm really not sure what you're telling me now Thomas
sorry darling
no
I really can't tell
I'm sure I'm being thick but I don't know what you're telling me
let's just put that out there „ shall we
well it's a dirty nappie „ isn't it
right
we'll just pop it outside there
then we'll take it too the dustbin in a moment
I'm going to wash my hands now and then I'll give you a wash
yes you do
you've just had your breakfast
you've got
you've had
what have you had at breakfast today
what did you finish your breakfast with
what have you just eaten in that bowl
raspberries
you've had an apple
you've had cereal
you've had an apple
and you've had a bowl of raspberries
and some juice
stand still please
I like your red socks
oh dear
is it a big effort
it's a dirty effort
you've got a nasty scratch on your chin
what as happened
not anything
nothing as happened
ThomasMiddlename Lastname
I'm FirefighterMummy and you're FirefighterSam
I'm FirefighterMorris „ am I
well I understand that FirefighterMorris is a lady so I'm quite happy about that
are you
right
one more rinse of your hands and then we'll wipe them dry with the towel
FiremanSam's lucky
why
he's a very clever fireman
it took me a long time to work out what FiremanSam's song said at the end
but it ends with the line Sam is the hero next door
do you know what a hero is Thomas
what's a hero
yes
Fireman's the hero next door
a hero is somebody who does really good things
heroic things
it's a bit of a long word „ isn't it
but if
say Purdie went outside now
and she got stuck in the mud
and you rescued her
you pulled her out and saved her
you'd be a hero
you'd be a hero „ wouldn't you
well FiremanSam put AuntieMabel's chip pan out
he rescued her from the locked cupboard
so
because I've got something to show you
that's why I'm sitting here
is that why you said what are you sitting here for
you want me to cry
why
not now

why am I crying
what did you say about wallpaper
wallpaper man shut
you're a paper man „ are you
it's a box
it's ThomasTheTankEngine „ isn't it
just let me stop that tap dripping
it's annoying
it's a present
let's open it
well this is called fuzzy felt
and when Mummy was a little girl
I useta have fuzzy felt
but they've changed the shape of the box because the boxes useta be a lot longer than this
but once we open it
I think we'll get a pair of scissors
I'll show you what we can do with it
in fact I think at Grandma's Mummy as still got some fuzzy felt
we've got a farmyard one
and I think a circus
I can't remember
I useta have a lot of them
certainly this looks a nice one „ doesn't it
what does is say on the box
a favorite since nineteen fifty
you can see Gordon „ can you
well I think on the side of the box it shows you what's inside „ doesn't it
well shall we open it and have a look
knock knock
what's inside
hello
oh look at that
oh there's even a storage box to keep these felts in
well that's different as well
it comes in a big sheet now
yes
now what you do Thomas
that
that is the board and you can take these felt pieces off
and stick them on there and make a picture
so what shall we take off first
Gordon
right
well let's take Gordon off then
Gordon's number four „ isn't he
somehow the felt doesn't seem quite so
stiff
that's it
you put it on there
and look when you tip it up it doesn't come off
you can move it around
well yes
you can move the board round or you can move the picture round
look
if you suddenly want Gordon there you can have Gordon there
you can pick them up and move them around
it's a little bit like the stickers that we were playing with the other day „ isn't it
right
now what would you like to put on the picture as well as Gordon
James
we'll take James
just a minute
we needta pull him off
that's James
no you don't lick it darling
you just put it straight on the board
don't lick it
near Gordon
you're putting the two trains together
near one another
next to one another
no
it's felt
you don't needta lick it
they just stick automatically
right
what else have you got
two trucks
what are the trucks called
I don't know either
I was going to say Toby but that's Toby „ isn't it
number seven
I don't know what these two trucks are called
they don't have any numbers on them
I don't think it tells us on the box
I'll have a quick look but
no
it doesn't tell us darling
HaroldtheHelicopter
that's Harold there
it's heavy
it's hard work
you're pulling him from the main piece of felt „ aren't you
is that hard work getting him off
you have done it
well done Thomas
you did
now look
in the sky we could have some clouds with Harold
we could either have these little clouds as being in the sky with Harold
or we could pretend it's smoke coming from the steam engine „ couldn't we
what do you think it looks better as
steam from the steam engine or clouds in the sky with Harold
clouds in the sky with Harold
who are you taking off now
oh you're telling Gordon that ThomasTheTankEngine's here
that's quite funny really
because it's a very big picture of Gordon
but Thomas is not so large „ is it
that's right
Gordon is large and Thomas is little
clever boy
that's a good boy
Annie and Clarabel
that's right
oh you that's
now that is good
you see when we put the the two coaches Annie and Clarabel on the back of Thomas he is actually a longer train than Gordon
I can't get my words out

do you know what I mean Thomas
you haven't a clue
no
I haven't either
silly Mummy

it's a pity they didn't come with two different boards „ isn't it
because one board isn't really big enough with all these things
that's why I think they give you this you see
oh Douglas
no
I think Douglas and
Donald and Douglas are the black or the grey engines „ aren't they
numbers nine and ten
who's number eight
this is number eight
is that Henry
or Percy
oh well who's this one then
no
I don't think it's Douglas
I can't see one of Douglas
oh do you know who that one is
the orange one
who is it
TrevortheTractionEngine
or is it TrevortheTractionEngine
I'm not sure actually
because now I'm wondering who that one is
because that looks like a traction engine as well
this looks like the tractor
is it TrevortheTractor
oh we'll hafta get the book out „ won't we
and have a look
no
there's no fire engine on ThomasTheTankEngine
so we've got to find out which one's Trevor „ haven't we
the fat controller
SirTophamHat
SirTophamHat
is that what he's saying
stopq
stop everybody
he's telling them all to stop „ is he
right
the board's getting a little bit crowded
would you like to put some things in here
shall we put all the trains in that big blue compartment
just the trains in that one
that's right
yes
and then we could put
well we could put the clouds in one of the smaller compartments „ couldn't we
we could put the clouds in this one
and then we could put the fat controller in another one
because there are some more people
there's the fat controller
shall we put him in this one here
put it with the trains
that's a nice one of James „ isn't it
number five
that's nice „ isn't it
there
now we've still got plenty more things on here that we can make a picture with
what have we got
BertietheBus
well let's put Bertie on here
we'll put them on here first and then we'll put them in the compartment
in the compartments
okay
get it near you
I'll move it closer
what's this
you must be careful ripping them off Thomas
you're going to break them
it's the tunnel or the bridge „ isn't it
just a minute
I needta get some scissors because the felt hasn't come away from that one properly
before you rip them off if it's stuck just ask Mummy to help you and I'll get the scissors
there we are
just a little bit of felt
no gently Thomas
you're going to break it
gently darling
just pull them off one at a time
that's it
what do you think that is Thomas
no
look you're going to break it
you don't pull it off like that darling
no
there we are
what do you think that is
grass
there are even some trees „ aren't there
would you like to put the trees in with the clouds
or in that compartment
compartment
it just means a section of a box
the box is divided up into different sections „ isn't it
smaller boxes
there you are
you've got a bridge and a station
if you put the grass with the cows then when you come to make a picture you'll know where everything is „ won't you
if you have all the people in one and all the trains in another
look
tree there
right
now you know who this is „ don't you
it's Toby
he's not on a wall
no
have you seen a picture or a story about Toby on a wall
it's just you keep mentioning it this morning
another cloud there
look
that's right
now what have we got
another fat controller
looks like a little boy
it looks like a schoolboy
he as got his school tie on and his school cap
we could put him in the compartment with the fat controller „ couldn't we
he must be a little boy
do you think he's either waiting for a train or he's
or he's
he's waiting for Gordon „ is he
on his way to school
there you are
do you wanna
hop in did you say
hop in
that's right
you can do it on the picture „ can't you
and that
who's this
this is another little boy „ isn't it
waiting at the station
or is that a little girl
pardon
wash your flag
what do you mean
and look
there's a scene there with some houses
and a footpath
and a tree
you going to put that in with the trees and the clouds
oh
now who's this one
is this called Doug
oh number six
who's number six
is number six Percy
who's Henry then
can't you
you haven't seen him
I think we needta just take the scissors to that one Thomas
don't try ripping it
that's it
I think that's it now for trains
we've got
look
some more people „ haven't we
look at all these people
yes
that little girl's waiting for James
that looks like a guard
he as got a blue uniform „ hasn't he
and there's a lady and man
and two little girls in nice dress
oh
and do you know what else there is
what's those
what are those
that's right
baa lambs
they're sheep „ aren't they
in the fields
and there's a little gate there
a fence
two gates
right
there's some more things
look
to pull off
what's this
is this a signal
signal
there's another cloud
and another cloud there
look
the tail
oh the till
the box is a till
I see
like a supermarket till
a till in a shop
right
that's why you needta divide things „ don't you
no
don't pull like that love
just gently
gently
otherwise they're all going to get screwed up
right
I think those must be pieces of grass
or perhaps if we put them all together it looks like a forest
trees that as
oh look
you can see that in the distance „ can't you
a track and some tunnel
that's quite alright
and who are you
hm
I think that's it now
I think that's all
just empty
you tired
you're yawning
you are tired really „ aren't you
there we are
we don't need that now really „ do we
well you could look through it
I suppose
or we could wear it as a silly mask
it's just a
what we're left with now is a piece of felt that we pushed
that's right
we've pushed all the pieces
the pieces of felt that are characters from ThomasTheTankEngine we've pushed those through
and we're left with the piece of felt that looks like this
you've finished
well shall we make a picture with it now
oh I don't think
they're quite gentle Thomas
I think if you start screwing
no
if you start scooping them up with the digger it's going to ruin them
they've got to be kept flat so they'll stick to the felt
it's called a fuzzy felt Thomas
when Nana and Granddad arrive you'll hafta tell them that you've got a fuzzy felt
do you
oh you've tipped them all out now
do you
just a second
just one
it's in the bottom drawer „ is it
oh
which one
it's in the small one is it
with the fire engine
is it at the right hand side
it's the box at the right hand side
look at that
I was just checking that we've got everything we needed
there you are
that makes a lovely mask „ doesn't it
have you
you don't need a mask
you've thrown it on the floor because you're fine
there you are
don't squash
you mustn't squash them in Thomas
no
if you start squashing them we've got to do something else
because it's really to make a picture with „ isn't it
do you know what as happened
have you seen all the bits of fluff on my jumper
they've landed on the pad
he is a clever digger man „ isn't he
who's going through the tunnel
and what's he saying as he's going through the tunnel
poop poop

is that what he's saying
did you enjoy looking at that
the digger man's very hard at work „ isn't he
pardon
there are a lot of things „ aren't there
I've just been to get the ThomasTheTankEngine book
because I thought we could have a look through and check that we know what all these characters are
because we're a bit unsure „ aren't we
about some of them
no
I don't think there's Douglas there
just be careful Thomas
you mustn't damage them
you're working in your shop
right
right
number three is Henry
number one is Thomas
oh we can't write on the book
I don't know who number two is
number three is Henry
number four is Gordon
then we've got HaroldtheHelicoper „ haven't we
and who've we got
we've got Toby there
Toby's number seven
isn't he
is James number five
oh yes there are some fire engines on some of the pages
ah Terence
TerencetheTractor
so Thomas
this orange one here
look
where's the orange one
this look
matches that picture
that's TerencetheTractor
okay
where's the fire engine
we'll come to that page in a moment „ won't we
which engine's number two
do you know
might be Edward number two
yes
oh Percy is number six
Toby's seven
oh yes
that's the picture of the fire engine on it
why's Gordon frightened
it says there's a fire
how many fireman can you see
lots
how many
can you count them
four
one two three just four
oh we've got BertietheBus „ haven't we
just be careful with these
now have you finished with those
well let's just move them over there Thomas
on the floor „ aren't they
yes
what's FiremanSam doing
putting it out you mean
Gordon's frightened
the fireman's
say help
I bet he does
right
right
now we've discovered that number eight is Doug
there is an engine called Doug
number nine is Donald
and what's number ten called
no
this one
the twins
do you remember
Donald and
Donald and twins
Douglas
ah Edward is number two
so we've got Thomas Edward Henry Gordon James Percy Toby Doug Donald and Douglas
okay
but there's still some characters in there that we don't recognize
they might be in a different book
right
shall we go back to the one with the fire engine
there we are
just going to have another look at them now
that's number five
that's six
that's four
no flashing lights
no
well I think the flashing lights Thomas are probably as the fire engine is approaching the fire
but once he as got to the fire there's no needta have flashing lights
right
I think we've pretty much sorted this „ don't you
is it not
never mind
where's a window cleaner
oh yes
it says who does this van belong to
and it has a ladder and a some buckets and a cloth on top of it
so we presume it's the window cleaner „ don't we
right
we've got number one
Thomas with Clary and Annabel
we haven't got two Edward
or three Henry
we've got four Gordon
five James
six Percy
seven Toby
and eight Doug
and we haven't got nine or ten
Douglas and Donald
Donald and Douglas
we've got HaroldtheHelicopter
pardon
oh the transporter
yes
car transporter
HaroldtheHelicopter
TerencetheTractor
BertietheBus
Annie and Clarabel the coaches
and we're left with these three
those must just be trucks
they haven't got a number so perhaps they haven't got a name
and this I think is the traction engine
but I don't know it's name
so we'll hafta look out Thomas
if you see a picture with those on you tell me
bananas
it says what kind of fruits is the fruit lorry collecting
well you've just told us „ haven't you
green apples
mm
that sounds nice „ doesn't it
where as your fingers gone
are they hiding
where are they hiding
under the book
that's a funny place to hide „ isn't it
can see Thomas's arms
right
not Thomas's fingers
I see
have you got a cold Thomas
you sound a bit snuffily today
oh now don't start something
have you got a cold darling
where
where
where
there
ah right
is there an ice cream van
oh yes
well that's the picture of the seaside „ isn't it
people often eat ice cream at the seaside
you want an ice cream in my home „ do you
you've only just had your breakfast Thomas
I don't think so
no
I know you've asked nicely but no
it's too
it's too close to breakfast
it's not a very warm day anyway „ is it
you need the fire on
to warm yourself up
who's
silly fire
who's this coming now
you think it's Daddy
is the digger riding over the page
now Thomas
it looks like the ThomasTheTankEngine characters are at the zoo
it says this animal likes wallowing in the mud
what is it's name
it's
that's right
it's a hippopotamus
it's a hippo
do you remember when we went in to see Elaine to do that video
and we were looking at the wallpaper border
and we could see tigers and elephants
and we said we saw a hippo „ didn't we
hiding
I think it had pandas on it as well
do you remember that wallpaper
well it's just to make the room look pretty „ isn't it
it says what is the stripy animal Thomas can see in the shed
what is it
a tiger
what tall animal is James carrying
a giraffe
this is the king of the jungle
what animal is it
what animal likes to eat bamboo shoots
a big bear
it's called a panda
it likes shoots
yes
black and white bear called a panda
oh what's that animal sitting on BertietheBus's radiator
it is a monkey
oh
who's hiding in the water
a crocodile
this bird likes ice and snow
what is it
Pingu
it's a penguin
you watch Pingu on television „ don't you
Henry found this animal in his tunnel
what is it
you're quite right
it's a big elephant
and this animal likes climbing trees
what is it
a big bear
oh look the sun's shining
that's nice „ isn't it
oh and there's all sorts of shapes here
what shapes are the cases on the platform
they're rectangle
BertietheBus is passing a road sign
what shape is it
you know what shape that is
what is it
it's a triangle
you're quite right
what shapes does Percy see in the sky
clouds and
star
star shapes
Thomas's wheels are round like a circle
how many other circles can you see
what else is round on the picture of Thomas
his face
and his eyes
and his lights
and his buffers
look
those are his buffers
would you like to look at a different page now
you wanna make a tunnel with it
like that
I don't think it's going to stand up very well „ do you
there
no
it won't stand very well
how's that
oops

well shall we put the fuzzy felt box at one side
that's a silly laugh
there you are
Thomas
you tinker
what a silly laugh
dear
are you going to get all giggly
no
I needta look at this because I wanna read what it says
it's about fuzzy felt
oh I tell you what
this sounds very good
they've got books as well as boards
you want the police car to go through the tunnel „ do you
well you mustn't damage the book
how's that
where they ask you to put things like pigs birds on the page
you need a big fire engine „ do you
you'd like to look at that now
I don't think the fire engine will go through the tunnel Thomas
that's a bit too large
is it fine
okay
whatever
what about BertietheBus
he would fit nicely through the tunnel „ wouldn't he
it's too large
I thought BertietheBus fitted under there quite nicely Thomas
oh the fire engine's too large
yes
of course it is
yes
what do you want the ladder for
you need
it's broken but you need the ladder to make it better
what do you need help for Thomas
who's stuck in the tree
I think the whole tunnel as collapsed „ hasn't it
now
why don't we take he ladder from there and use it to wedge open the book there
and then we can prop it open at that side with this
oh

but it didn't quite work „ did it
that's better
now the fire engine as gone through with no problems at all this time
hip hip hooray
hallelujah
hallelujah
hurrah
oh dear
where as it broken
whereabouts
where
you'd like me to fix it
please
well the fireman's not even sitting in the engine
do you think he should be
okay
right
there's the roof
that better
okay
do you think it will go through the tunnel with the ladders on as well
only just
only just
it's a tight fit
oh what will happen if the fire engine gets stuck in the tunnel
not anything
no
because the fire engine will be stuck
we'll hafta go to another fire station to get another fire engine to shunt it along
later
hello fireman
how are you
you're FireSamThomas
or FiremanThomas
FiremanSamThomas
how are you FiremanSamThomas
are you
well I've got to go to work now FiremanSamThomas
do you mind
you don't mind at all „ do you
really
because you're going to have a nice day „ aren't you
without me
yes
you going to have a good day Thomas
is the fireman asking me if I've seen the fire engine
well I haven't seen it round here
it was last stuck in the tunnel fireman
I'd look in the tunnel if I were you
oh he as found it „ has he

excuse me
pardon
his oxygen tank
has that fallen on the floor
it as spilt
it as fallen onto the floor
it as got stuck in the tunnel
you want me to hold it
I thought you were going to try and dangle it on my ear
like that
like an earring
does that look like a nice wooden earring
no
it's a wooden oxygen tank
from the the fire engines
now you can wear it
oh lovely
look at that
you look like SisterEileen
with big dangly
wobble
with big dangly earrings
I don't think SisterEileen wears big dangly earrings „ does she
does she
oh well
if you say so
the fire engine's coming out of the fire service
do you need
do you
do you mean the fire station Thomas
rather than the fire service
is that the fire station where the fire engines sleep
like the engine shed
the trains sleep in the engine shed
but FiremanSam's fire engine sleeps in the fire station
have you dropped it
