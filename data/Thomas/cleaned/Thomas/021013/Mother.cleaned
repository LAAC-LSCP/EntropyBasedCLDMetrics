you're looking at your newspaper
oh what a good boy for getting in your seat
sorry
good fireman
you're a fireman today „ are you
okay
right
let's get your little strap round your tummy
I'm AuntyMabel „ am I
and you're FiremanSam
right
as long as I know who's who that's alright
the tape's in here
no
it's the microphone
we've put the microphone on top of the cake stand because
well the cupboard that we useta have the microphones on has gone to SisterEileen's house
and we need somewhere that's steady to put the microphone on top
I thought it would be quite good up there
you're putting gloves on
you're putting an envelope on your hand
look
the other microphone's up there
it's near what darling
well it's the bottles of wine
well what do you say
that's better
is it

excuse me
well you can take them off „ can't you
I was just about to say I haven't got any blackcurrant juice
I'm sorry
I've got some orange
will that do
well it's RibenaToothkindOrange
it's orange rather than blackcurrant but it's still made by Ribena
no
it's not dirty beer or wine
the wine is up there
next to the microphone on the WelshDresser we've got wine
well yes
if you want wine that's up there
orange wine
it's a job to get the lid off
I can't get the lid on the cup
I don't know why
Daddy took the top off at dinnertime „ did he
yesterday
on Tuesday
and what were you drinking
orange juice or CocaCola
were you
well I'll tell you
not in a beaker like this
well I'll tell you why
because with fizzy drinks like lemonade and CocaCola if you try and put a lid on all of the bubbles make the lid go pop
and it flies off in the air
so there's no point putting it on in the first place
that's why we usually give you CocaCola or lemonade in a glass with a straw if you're going to have that
would you like RiceKrispies or cornflakes Thomas
Mummy's having cornflakes
what would you like
you'd like Krispies
would you like some milk with them
what do you say
no
either yes please or no thank you
would you like milk
there you are
I'll get you a spoon
here you are treasure
how's that
that nice
aren't you a treasure
you are
you're my little treasure
well you can be FiremanSam but you're still Mummy's little treasure
well you could be AuntyMabel's little pot of treasure „ can't you
if you want milk if you change your mind you can let me know „ can't you
I'm trying to work out what we've got in the fridge Thomas
that smells very strong onions
I can't tell what it is
well we had some strawberries in the fridge
well after you've eaten your cereal we'll have some strawberries
how about that
do you
well again what do you say Thomas
yes please
you're not FiremanSam
you're FiremanSam
no
that's a teaspoon Thomas
and if you start banging with it you'll be in trouble
remember what happens
it is a teaspoon
it's a spoon to eat your cereal with
it's not a dirty teaspoon
I've just got it out of the drawer
it's perfectly clean
I'm going to have cornflakes Thomas
I don't think I'll have milk with them though
is the juice nice
were you very thirsty this morning
there we are
I'll come and sit next to you Thomas
well we'll pop it there
you don't need your gloves on while you're eating that „ do you
but you don't need gloves on while you're eating cereal
no
you don't
what do you say
don't cry
don't get upset
Thomas
well FiremanSam doesn't cry „ does he
he doesn't
I've never seen FiremanSam cry
what makes FiremanSam cry
pardon Thomas
what did you say
FiremanSam's
FiremanSam's tummy's on alert
what do you mean FiremanSam's tummy's on alert
Thomas smacked him
FiremanSam smacked some children
why did FiremanSam smack some children
they bashed what
some children bashed FiremanSam's beer
so he smacked them
where have you see this
on the television
are you sure it was FiremanSam you were watching and not something like LondonsBurning
it doesn't really sound like FiremanSam to me Thomas
no
I'm talking about the television program
was it definitely FiremanSam
Thomas will you eat your cereal please
come on
you're in a very ratty mood this morning
what's the
what's the matter with you
you're FiremanSam on you vest
well you're not the smily cheerful little boy I normally hafta eat breakfast with
you're folding the letter up
I thought it was a pair of gloves
are they nice
pardon
would you like some milk to make them go snap crackle and pop
no
it isn't
RiceKrispies only go snap crackle and pop when you put some milk on them
right
we'll pop a little drop on and then you listen
let's just mix the milk in a little bit and then you'll be able to listen to them
they are a lot easier to swallow Thomas
when they have milk „ aren't they
pardon
who as been sick on the pavement
when
when were you sick on the pavement
on Friday
well I don't know about you being sick on the pavement Thomas
and I think I would because I was with you on Friday all day
no
it's not Friday
and the dustbin men don't come on Fridays
they come on Mondays
no
it's not Monday

because it was a beautiful day and I was stuck in an office
it was a perfect day
lotsof sunshine
it was beautiful
it's always nice
well I didn't cry but I was little bit sad I couldn't go
and it's always a nice day when I work
every week it's beautiful the day I work
it doesn't matter whether I work on a Wednesday or a Sunday or whenever
are you hiding that letter
it's your glove
are you hiding your gloves
I wish you'd eat your breakfast Thomas
I was going to get you some strawberries but I can't get them till you've eaten your RiceKrispies
I enjoyed that
I can hear an aeroplane

Purdie eats breakfast
and AuntyMabel's dog Pippin I bet eats breakfast or she eats breakfast

you don't need lotsof carriages
that's the front
that's the trailer with the horse in it
yes
I'm sitting on the platform
ah well I'm just making some toast at the moment Thomas
so I needta keep near the cooker
we don't have a very good success rate with making toast „ do we
it always seems to be on fire

is it
we haven't got any toddler group next Tuesday „ have we
no
Julian's

Julian is the man who does the music group and we've not gone to music group for a long time because
yes
Julian's poorly
so we haven't been doing that on a Friday
he as got a poorly voice „ hasn't he
a poorly throat
and he can't sing
he as got to rest his voice
it's very important for a singer who has a poorly throat to rest it
does he need a sweetie to cheer him up
oh he probably does „ doesn't he
what about a mint
yes I'm sure he sucks lotsof mints
but there's no toddler group next Tuesday because it's half term

well I tell you what
we'll do one slice with Marmite and one slice with jam
and then we can each have one of each
we can share „ can't we
oh no
what I mean is we
yes
you can eat it but we'll each have one slice of Marmite and one slice with jam
that's quite alright Thomas
you've got a beautiful white sleep suit on
I bet it isn't white when you've finished eating though
the train as fallen over
how did that happen
there you are darling
one with Marmite
one with jam
you thought you'd lost it
oh no Thomas
come along
it is breakfast time
we've got to be quick
we've got to be quick this morning because as soon as we've finished this I need you changed
washed nappie changed and dressed because Mummy as got to go out
I think the train driver and the horse would like something to eat
that poor train driver
and he as been driving round and round all morning
I think it's time he had a little break „ don't you
stopped on the pavement „ has he
that's right
was that the sound of the train stopping that
oh Thomas he hasn't had any
he as not got out of his cab
why's he saying no
the passengers going push
what do you mean
oh one of the ThomasTheTankEngine characters
which character

Gordon as got a trailer full of horses in it
oh thank you
oh the horse is lovely
well the horse is really hungry
the horse says he can't understand people who don't eat breakfast
I wish Thomas would eat breakfast
I do as well horse
I think he's a bit silly
do you know what's going to happen horse
yes
he's going to be very hungry later on in the day
and guess what horse
when he says he's hungry nobody's going to give him anything and his tummy will be rumbling
and it'll seem such a long time till lunchtime „ won't it
yes
it will
did you hear that Thomas
Mummy and horse were having a conversation and horse thinks you should eat something
because you're going to be hungry later on „ aren't you
the horse is crying
oh it as probably been very upset
he's worried for you
he's worried what's going to happen if you haven't eaten
is he having a sleep
oh have you wiped his tears because he was crying
ah that's nice
and he thanked you for wiping them
ah that's very sweet
you've given him a kiss as well
is the horse called Gordon
oh I thought it was the trailer like ThomasTheTankEngine character Gordon
I thought it was the trailer that was Gordon
we haven't really give the horse a name before „ have we
the little Lego cat is called Purdie like out pussy cat „ isn't it
because your friends Molly and Francis bought you that one year for your birthday or Christmas
I can't remember now
and they bought it because the Duplo box said Purdie the cat
and they bought it because they new that our pussy cat was called Purdie
oh the horse wants a carry
yes
I like the horse
the horse and I have had a very nice conversation this morning

he brought the plate up to you so that you would eat
ah right
he's going to
just sit there and just watch
just see how much he can eat
he wants to see if you can eat as much toast as he ate as little while ago
because horses have very big appetites
they eat a lot
there's an expression Thomas
where people say I'm as hungry as a horse
and that means oh their tummy's really rumbling and they're hungry and they could eat ever such a lot
oh the horse isn't sick
no
no
it hasn't
he's still going to check up on you to see how much you've eaten
is it dark

he'll be going home for a sleep then „ is he
I can't believe Thomas
that a whole day has passed and it's now night time and you still haven't finished that piece of toast
oh that is a good boy Thomas
the horse will be so pleased when he sees you've eaten it
oh Mummy's quite tired today
that's a lot of noise
are you tired today
you're a clown doing silly dances „ are you
