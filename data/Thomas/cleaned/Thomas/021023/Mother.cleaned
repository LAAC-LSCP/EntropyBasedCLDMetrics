are these the stones you collected for Mummy
from the seaside
you brought them home for Mummy
did you get them this morning
Grandma and Granddad
was it from Blackpool
I think it was from Cleveleys „ wasn't it
it was somewhere near Blackpool
is it
oh right
but it was the seaside near Blackpool „ wasn't it
it's where there are a lot of pebbles on the beach
you brought some stones home „ didn't you
from the seaside
because we've got some in the garden that you brought before when you've been to stay
because you know all your windmills
well all of those are in a pot secured by heavy pebbles „ aren't they
that you brought home
there are some lovely ones there
there is a big one
let me have a look at it
gosh
that's a big one
that's absolutely huge „ isn't it
look at the color in that Thomas
it's sort of a mottle grey but
can you see there are lovely flecks of blue
I mean that is absolutely gorgeous „ isn't it
gorgeous
and this is one
you're putting them all in the back of your bicycle „ aren't you
oh it's a lorry „ is it
I'm sorry
and this is another one that I think is lovely
look at that
it as got flags on it

don't throw them in
you're making too much noise
look at this one
I mean that's a much darker
does it look like toothpaste to you
is it because of the stripe
yes
it as got a line running down the middle „ hasn't it
the sun is shining
it's
it's shining in your eyes
it's a gorgeous day actually „ isn't it
it's a what day
it's not a dirty day all day long
I'm dirty on my tummy
I shouldn't be
I've had a nice bath this morning
do you know why
because somebody wasn't here first thing this morning
were they
what blue caravan
the blue caravan
what blue caravan darling
the lady got off a blue caravan to get something
she got out of the caravan
oh I know what you're talking about
it wasn't a caravan darling
it was a van
it was a blue van
she was delivering something
do you wanna see what it was
you won't believe what it was when I go and get it
you just wait there
no
it wasn't a sausage
you just hold on there tight
well way before Christmas Thomas Mummy ordered some little Christmas books for you
it's alright
it was from the book catalogue
they were out of stock
and so
no
it didn't come in a green lorry
so they said to me would you still like the books
and I said oh yes please
because I think they might be a little bit old for you anyway at the moment
well we can look through them
and it isn't a blue caravan
it was just a blue van that the lady brought them in this morning
we'll keep
yes
we'll keep that
because that's the envelope I needta pay the bill and send it back
there are three books
but they're all Christmas
it is FatherChristmas
this is called a Christmas kitten
FatherChristmas has got a kitten
I'll just tell you what it says on the back
it's the day before Christmas
out in the snow the little black kitten is cold and hungry and lonely
nobody seems to want him
nobody seems to realize he's all alone and has no home to go to
but at last he stumbles on someone who knows just where he belongs
so that's a nice story „ isn't it
I'm sure that's going to be
this one is called Christmas in ExeterStreet
and I do think this one is a little bit too old for you at the moment
I know about this book
it says from top to bottom the house in ExeterStreet is full to bursting
no
the gate's shut now
it says there's a guest in every nook and cranny and even in the kitchen sink
well I think you've drunk it darling „ haven't you
do you
well we're going to have something to eat in a minute
because I was just about to get you changed and then we'll have a bite to eat
and look
the last book Thomas is called the toy maker
it says told in two parts
this is the story of a toy maker Matthew and the dolls he makes for Mary his daughter who is not strong enough to play in the street with the other children
many years later Mary
no
it's not toothpaste darling
could I have that please
could I have it please
don't touch it
Thomas
thank you
many years later Mary returns
Thomas
why did you do that
no
you were told not to „ weren't you
it says many years later Mary returns to the toy shop with her granddaughter and makes some surprising discoverys
so they're all Christmas books „ aren't they
and it's not Christmas anymore
but still
you driving off with your stones
oh PostmanPat's stones
is PostmanPat going to use them in his garden
I think you can get in trouble actually for collecting pebbles from the beach now
oh is PostmanPat asleep
it must be very early in the morning if PostmanPat is still in bed
I will
yes
I wonder whether I'm going to see PostmanPat today
he might have a letter for me or a parcel
and if he hasn't then sometimes he pops by anyway to say hello
I wonder if he as got any stones on the back of his van
that would be nice if he came to show me some stones
I wonder if PostmanPat as been staying with his Grandma and Granddad in PoultonLeFylde
he might have been to the beach this morning
because when he goes to the beach he usually collects some stones for me and some pebbles
it would be really nice if he had „ wouldn't it
wouldn't that be lovely if he had
I think it's time PostmanPat was up
I bet his alarm clock's about to go off
dingalingaling
good morning
wakeywakey
rise and shine
PostmanPat time to get up
no
I think he must be fast asleep
PostmanPat
PostmanPat
no
he's asleep
oh I shall leave him
I'm going to go and have something to eat
it's a pity PostmanPat didn't arrive
he could have joined me
hello PostmanPat
I can see PostmanPat's van

and do you remember the size of the ostrich egg
they were like this „ weren't they
Pippin as realized something's wrong
what was AuntieMabel running for
well AuntieMabel went to feed her hens and while she was outside she heard the telephone ringing
so she ran inside to answer the telephone and it was her sister and they were talking for a long time
and then Pippin realized there was a fox going into the hen house and he ran into the house and barked and barked
and tugged at AuntieMabel's skirt
and she said oh Pippin stop it
whatever is the matter
and then she realized there was something wrong
so she ran outside with Pippin and she could see the fox
and what did she say
shoo
she shooed the fox away because they don't needta be near hens
well because foxes like to eat hens
and that's not very nice „ is it

would you like a drink
I've made a cup of coffee and I'm really enjoying it Thomas
oh look
I found some more crisps in that packet
Thomas look how many I've given you
you tired
what's the matter
what's the matter
well I have left them there darling
I haven't touched them
Thomas what on earth is the matter
I think you've had such a busy day and we're only halfway through
it as all too much „ isn't it
oh darling I haven't eaten your crisps
have I
oh Thomas
shh
no
listen
Mummy picked up the packet
it was her empty packet as I thought
and when I picked it up it wasn't empty it had crisps in it
so I've given them to you
oh darling
I've given you all the crisps there were
but there weren't many to start with
I've shared them with you
don't you
oh dear
well I'll take them back then „ shall I
give them back to you
oh you look so tired
do you want a little sleep treasure
oh
I don't know what the matter is with you
Thomas what's the matter with you
Thomas they're there on your plate
there aren't any more
oh come along now
I wish I ad not given any to you if you're going to be like this
because you thought they ad gone and you were quite happy
and I certainly don't give things to somebody who just says more
what about please may I have
mhm
oh dear
I'm eating the sandwich that I made which is more than what you've done
I've made all those sandwiches and you haven't touched them
why do you needta get down Thomas
no
I can't eat your sandwich as well
Thomas listen
darling if you don't wanna eat it fair enough
no
I can't manage to eat your sandwich as well
we'll just leave it
no
I can't manage another sandwich
we'll just leave it or wrap it up in some foil
and then perhaps this afternoon
yes
alright
perhaps this afternoon a lot later on you might be a bit more peckish
shh
alright treasure
yes
I think we'll get you down
have a bit of a rest
oh don't you
you don't sound very happy Thomas
what would you like me to say
I wonder whether I'll see PostmanPat again today
I doubt it because it's lunchtime now
in fact most people have had their lunch
I doubt very much whether PostmanPat's here
anyway if he does come to see me there's something I'd like to show him
there's something I can see when I'm sitting in my chair that I've not noticed before
PostmanPat's head
what do you mean PostmanPat's head
no
I can't see anything
I can just see something I'm keeping an eye on in my chair
and if PostmanPat pays a visit I'll show him what I can see
it's quite interesting
I think I can see his van
in fact his van's parked right outside of my house
but there's no PostmanPat inside
PostmanPat
perhaps I'll give him a ring
ah here he is
PostmanPat just come here
hello
how nice to see you
how are you
ah you come to the window PostmanPat
do you remember last Saturday
we went for a walk and it was a beautiful sunny day
that was before we knew anything was the matter with GranddadBealby „ wasn't it
do you remember we went on the monkey path and we saw that very tall tree with the bird's nest in it
well I was just sitting in my chair waiting for the Postman and can you see over there
can you see the house where the doctor lives with the children
do you know the one I mean
we watch them coming home from school
next to their house you can see the little boy Sam you can see his parent's red car
now do you see where I mean
that red car
now you look above the red car
not up above
above
and can you see the tree with the bird's nest in it
can you
I don't know whether you can actually sweetheart
shall I stand you
up a little bit higher
you look straight over there
do you see where I mean
you're just breathing on the windows
that's something I did when you went to Grandma and Granddad's the other day
don't breathe
no Thomas
don't
or I shall take you down
can you see it
you've seen it „ haven't you
I know you have now because you said thereq and you pointed exactly in the right place
can you see that bird's nest
you just saw it didn't you
so look we've got two nests to watch now
and look
well there's one at the front
there's one there that we can see from this side of the house
and the other one we can see from your bedroom window
and look at the other fun thing Thomas
can you see the blue sky
and the sun shining through
now you look just above Sue's house
can you see all the rays of the sun coming down
it looks like stripes in the sky
doesn't it
just above Sue's house
do you think it looks like somebody as got a paintbrush and gone boomboomboom and drawn loads of stripes in the sky
Thomas don't be silly

it is not AuntieMabel sat on a wall
that's Mummy having a conversation about sun rays
no
you're on something else now
I sing TheArchers to you
the them to TheArchers
that's not Dumpty
HumptyDumpty say on a wall goes HumptyDumpty sat on a wall
HumptyDumpty had a great fall
oops you've fallen off the chair
oops all
all the kings horses and all the king's men
couldn't put HumptyDumpty together again
and TheArchers is tumtetumtetumtetum
it's not it's TheArchers
it's not HumptyDumpty sat on a wall
now you've moved this chair I've found another stone on the floor
look
it's the very large one that looks the ostrich egg
and then there's a small one
a big ostrich
it looks like a big ostrich egg that
it's an ostrich egg
an ostrich
were you kissing it
oh no
you mustn't do that Thomas
that's not kissing that's licking
no
because you got them off the beach this morning
good Lord above
you don't know who as been walking on them or what as happened to them
you don't lick them
oh look who's back
even Purdie as come to see what you're doing
no Purdie thinks you're silly
she wouldn't do that
oh I wonder
well I have seen PostmanPat today
because I was sitting on my chair and I saw a bird's nest and I thought if PostmanPat comes I'll point it out to him
and he did and I did
oh I wonder if I'll see PostmanPat again today
he might come back to have another look at the bird's nest
because do you know there are birds flying to it
there's a bird that keeps going back to it
perhaps that's the Mummy bird with some worms
hello PostmanPat
are you going to keep an eye on that bird's nest
well there's a bird that keeps flying backwards and forwards
I would imagine it's the big bird gone to get some worms to feed the baby birds in the nest
or perhaps they're still building it and maybe it's
it looks more like a crocodile „ does it
have you seen any crocodile nests in trees
have you
ah I thought you might have done
Purdie is not a crocodile
she as got sharp teeth though „ hasn't she
as you've discovered when you pull her tail and she as gone
no she's not
but please don't
she's not
she's a beautiful pussy cat
Mummy's seeing Grandma's cat this weekend
oh be careful
what color's Grandma's cat
black and white „ isn't it
like Felix
