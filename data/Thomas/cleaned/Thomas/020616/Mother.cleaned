on the apron
now we need a lot more sugar „ don't we
a lot more icing sugar in the bowl

mhm
I've got something in mind
just finish our drink first
hot coffee

do you want a sip of hot tea
it's not that hot
be very careful
not that hot
just be careful
is it hot
wow
you can feel it go in your tummy
would you like to finish that drop of milk
mhm
well let's wipe the table first
can Purdie have that drop of milk from your bottle
I can't talk
I've got a mouthful of biscuit
hm
I can't talk
no
quite right
hot tea

I don't think you can hold it
have a little sip from my cup
is that nice
mm
you've enjoyed it
your tummy as enjoyed it too
does that mean your tummy feels nice and full
is that what you mean
you've enjoyed it
tummy as got the sandwiches
sandwiches yum
well you're talking about sandwiches and BobTheBuilder

is that what you were singing
well I think before we look at the leaves Thomas I'm going to just get some flour
because you know how we've just made some icing with some icing sugar
we're going to make a little bit of
what's Mummy doing up here
she's doing something really naughty „ isn't she
she's climbing

naughty stop it
aah
am I being naughty
oh I'm terribly sorry
we're going to get another little bowl now
oh are you cross
oh are you cross with me
I'm terribly sorry Tom
pardon
cry
no I'm not going to cry
do you think because you've told me off I should cry
no
I'm not
yes
I know you're cross with me for climbing on the chair
heh stop it
now we put some flour in this little bowl and mixing it with some water
yes
oh look at that

now that makes a sticky glue „ doesn't it
like a paste
poo
I think we might need a drop more flour in there
ooh
it doesn't look very nice
would you like to start mixing that
like you did the icing
we can mix the
wow
I don't think the flour and water smells or tastes quite as nice as the icing Thomas
now what we're going to do
ah what's this
what's this
what's this
ginger
ginger pussy cat
no
it's just on the front of the coloring book
it's a picture of a ginger pussy cat „ isn't it
but it's only it's face
it's not it's body
can't see it's tail
right
table's still a little bit dump „ isn't it
so we'll just dry it with that
and today when we came back from toddler group we walked through the park and we came across lotsof leaves
what was happening with the leaves
blowing all over
they were blowing down from the trees „ weren't they
blowing all over
how many leaves fell over
is that what you were saying
and we picked quite a few leaves too „ didn't we
up from the floor
and what colors are the leaves
brown and greeny colors
and

there's all sorts of colors
and you've got them here
can you hear them all crunching
crunching and crackling
do they make a nice sound when we went walking through all the leaves on the floor
they were nice and crispy „ weren't they
what's this
well that's the hedgehog from you bedroom
and I thought we would draw
copying this with yellow paper
shall we
shall we draw a hedgehog
where shall we start
we only wanna draw a very small hedgehog „ don't we
are we
a hedgehog
and then once we've drawn the hedgehog we're going to cut round him
oh wow
that's a nice hedgehog
look at that
actually that hedgehog looks a little bit like a leaf that as fallen down „ doesn't it
no we've got scissors here
snip snip
scissors
snip snip scissors
we're cutting round where Mummy as drawn
around the hedgehog like that
carefully
we're going to hafta get some proper little scissors for you „ aren't we
these are the ones that I use for everything
and they're not really suitable „ are they for little fingers
now this time of year Thomas we often see hedgehogs in piles of leaves
do you know what this time of year is called
autumn
snip snip snip
snip snip snip
it's called autumn
it's the time when all the leaves fall off the trees
oh I see
with the bits of yellow paper that are fallen off the hedgehog you're wrapping them up into paper and making them fall
now does that look vaguely like a hedgehog Thomas
does it
yes
I think it does „ doesn't it
now what I think we'll do with that
well you can hold it yes
this is some glue
it's called a Pritt stick
yeah Pritt stick
now do you wanna do what Mummy's doing
there you are
you hold it
that's it
and we'll just gently put in a little bit of sticky onto the paper hedgehog
that's it
there
now would you like to stick him
that way up
onto the green paper
just there
is that right
oh you want him there
okay
okay
now he's stuck now
now you've got to do this to stick him down
that's right
press firmly
press firmly
can you see all these
these are his little prickly bits „ aren't they
what are they called
I can't think
needles
those are the hedgehog's needles
alright
I think he's stuck down now
there
now to make him look even more prickly
I think first of all we needta give him some eyes and nose „ don't you
what have we got in the cupboard
let's have a look
I think we might have some sultanas or currants
there we are
sultanas
you like sultanas „ don't you
there you are
now because it's a side view of a hedgehog Thomas I think we've really only got one eye „ haven't we
he as only got one eye
so with this other paste that we made shall we put a little bit of sticky on the back of the sultana and stick it there
the hedgehogs eye
how's that
is that nice

I don't think he really needs a nose „ does he
I can't think what we've got we could use from those
we could use that one I suppose „ couldn't we
so shall we put a bit of sticky on that one
and that makes his sticky nose
look at that
ah wow
now we've also got some little pasta twists „ haven't we
here
do you think if we put some of those on his body like that it would make him look like he had spikes
what do you think
yes
what're you trying to say

I don't know to come with a bit of glue from the Pritt stick when you could have the lid off „ couldn't it
I think it would make him look such a sharp „ wouldn't it
prickly
oh look at this
