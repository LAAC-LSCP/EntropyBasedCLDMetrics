you don't wanna go out on your bicycle
oh we're going to do this first
but I thought later on we could go out on the bicycle
right
do you wanna see what we've got here
well we'll do it on the floor
I'll show you in a minute what we're going to do
we got this last year „ didn't we
just a second
now we had this last year
but we didn't actually use it „ did we
just bear with me a second sweetheart
because I just needta move something from over there first
it's the Teletubbies gardening set
and it's a little rucksack
and in the green rucksack we've got
no
not now
not now
wait Thomas please
we've got four little pots
and what comes
right
and what are those colors
what are they the colors of
the Teletubbies
there's a pot for every Teletubby
but unlike the Teletubbies where TinkyWinky is the largest the purple pot is certainly the largest but Po is the baby in the Teletubbies
but according to this set it's Lala the yellow one that's the small pot
right
I just need to wash that
well Dipsy's small
Dipsy's the green one
but it should really go in order size of the purple one for TinkyWinky
the green for Dipsy
yellow for Lala
and red for Po
but it doesn't „ does it
yes
I've brought it
yes
it as come with a little trowel and I've brought a pot of compost in from the garden
and you've got to fill
that's right
with those tubs with compost
that's it
never mind
that's alright
that's why we're doing it on the kitchen floor because it doesn't matter really
we'll try and get it in the pots but if we don't manage it it doesn't matter „ does it
now we needta put a little bit more in that one
we want them almost up to the top
I think that's quite a lot Thomas for that
no
you must be careful when you're doing it
what do you do now
well let's just take a little bit out
and we'll leave that pot
would you like to fill the others up please
that's it
shall I hold it over there
we're doing the yellow one now „ aren't we
have you noticed each of the flower pots has some flowers on them
I didn't look at the green one when we were filling up
let's just have a look at the green one
what did that have on it Thomas
oh
pink flowers
these pink flowers
so does the small yellow one
they perhaps have all the same
yes
they do
right
which one now
TinkyWinky or Po
TinkyWinky
right
I'll hold it if you like
and you fill it up
and it as come with it's own packet of seeds
just watch you don't kneel in that soil
normally when we're doing gardening like this we do it outside „ don't we
we've got some little seeds
candy tuft
and we're going to put some of those in these pots
and then what I think we'll do is another day we'll put some more compost in the big container and we'll sprinkle the rest of the seeds in that
tiny drop more
just a very small amount
very small amount
that's it
that's enough
that's lovely thank you
we've got one more pot to fill
Po
and then I think we'll get the dustbin and brush and sweep up before we do anything else
that's it
no
it's called compost
it's like soil
if you're outside planting some
it needs a little bit more soil
if you're outside in the garden there'll be plenty of soil
but when we're doing it in tubs and pots we needta put compost „ don't we
that's enough Thomas
that's enough
put the rest back in there please
that's a good boy
right
now can you just sit very still while I get a brush to sweep it up
you sit there
that's right
you sit that side
that's a good boy
while you're doing that would you like to have a little look at these stickers
and see what they say
well just a second
let me just sweep it all into the middle of the floor and you can sweep it onto the dustpan
how's that
right
do you wanna hold that
alright
you sweep it then
good boy
that's a good boy
what a good boy
aren't you clever with a dustpan and brush
right
no
don't do anymore for just a second
let me tip that into this pot with the compost
and then we'll have
yeah
we'll have another go
we'll just get it back into the middle
and then you can sweep it back again
how's that
you can have a go in a second
that's it
we've always got to tidy up when we've made a mess
right
would you like to sweep again Thomas
there you are treasure
oh there is
there's plenty
look
there you are
you have another sweep
you can't see anymore
that means you've done a good job „ doesn't it
fancy another sweep
come on
there's some here
look
where are you going with that brush
where are you going
oh no
we don't brush the carpets
it's here
look
where the soil is on the kitchen floor
are you going to come and put some seeds now in these
there'll be some more sweeping up to do when we've done that „ won't there
come on love
right
what I think we'll do now
we perhaps should have done this in the first place
we'll put that tray there
right
come and put your pots on the tray and then we'll plant the seeds
lift each of those pots onto the tray
TinkyWinky first
that's right
next Po
Dipsy near Mummy
well in a minute we can put some water in
right
now we needta open this
oh be careful you don't kick that over
now
just open this little packet of seeds
can you see the picture on the front
it does
it says Teletubbies on it and it's a picture of lotsof flowers
it's called fairy mix of candy
now I don't think you need that „ do you
let's just see what there is inside
oh look
it says Teletubbies candy tuft
well just open the packet
mm
just smell that
now shall I just show you
this one
what we do just with your finger just make a little hole
that's it
we'll tip some seeds into our hand
like that
well I'll show you and then you can do the next one
and we sprinkle them there
like that
what do you think to that
yes
you take them out of my hand
that's right
and tip them into this yellow
just the Lala one
look
because we haven't got those ready yet „ have we
just into this yellow one
no
just into the yellow one
right
pick up these little seeds and put those in as well
right
right
just a few
just a few
very gently Tom
otherwise you're not going to have any left for the other tubs
that's plenty
oh that's plenty „ isn't it
now what you needta do is just get your finger
we'll cover these up first
tap it like that
now out of this little pot do you wanna take a very small amount of soil
just in the tip of your trowel
I'll hold that over there
and we cover those seeds with a little bit more compost
just a tiny bit more will do it
lovely
tiny bit more
that's it
now tap it on the ground
right
which one would you like to do next
the red one
that's right
use your finger to just make a little hole
lovely
right
would you just like to put your trowel down while you do the seeds
we needta put the seeds in
there aren't very many left now Thomas
just sprinkle a few
because otherwise we won't have any left for this big pot „ will we
how's that
that's very clever
that's right
now just a second
we'll shake it
put more soil on
nice and safe
yeah
and we'll tap that and that's the red one done
now which one next
TinkyWinky
okay
right
what do you do first
that's right
make a little hole with your finger
like that
that's lovely „ isn't it
right now
some seeds
that's it
don't pour them all in because we've one more tub to do „ haven't we
that's it
hold it that way
that's it
lovely
and then let's just shake it first
right
yes
a little bit more soil
I think we'll keep it on the tray
mhm
that's very clever
aren't you a good boy
there we are
now we just needta press it down a little bit
and then the last one
right
use your finger just to make a little hole
that's it
yes
that's it
now you can sprinkle all the seeds that are left
you needta just hold the packet the other way
that's it
all the seeds that are left
let me just open the packet a little bit more
it doesn't matter if they all come out in this tub „ does it
there we are
right
you tip those into the green pot
what a clever boy
what a clever boy
that's right and tap it
and cover it up
that's right
it'll be exciting watching these if they grow „ won't it
do we think
that's lovely
little bit more perhaps
that's it
that's great
that really is good
now it says to firm them a little bit
so would you like to start the yellow one
just with your fingers
that's right
you can put the trowel down
no
don't stick your finger in Thomas
otherwise it won't grow
just gently
with your fingertip
just put the soil down
that's it
that's it
now shall we do the red one
red one
no
you don't need your trowel
just your fingertip
this is called firming the soil
yes
now we've done the yellow one „ haven't we
the green one
that's it
just your fingertips
can you feel the compost going down
can you feel that Thomas
does that feel nice
right
you think you've finished
I don't think we've done the purple one yet „ do you
right
that's it
and we do that one
that's lovely „ isn't it
now what I have realized is that there's no drainage holes at the bottom of here
now we've got to water them
do you wanna put the empty seed packets into the dustbin please
steady Thomas
you're going to kick them all over
right
there we are
a little bit of water
now would you just like to get the dustpan and brush
and just sweep that little bit of the floor like you did before
just that little bit of soil
and I'll get some water
that's right
no
just sweep this little bit
you've finished „ have you
right
now you know how to use a watering can „ don't you
that's right
ah
that's right
right
would you like to put a little bit more in the purple one
that's right
this edge
that's it
right
no more
a drop more in the red
that's enough
I think you've put a bit too much in the purple
a drop more in the yellow
and a drop more in the green
now isn't that lovely
I think you've enough really in them now Tom
don't wanna overwater them „ do we
right
have you had a look at the watering can
what's on the side
what's there a picture of on the side
yes
now we've all
we've all
oh they're not fridge magnets
they're little stickers to put in the pots
now do you wanna put stickers in the pots
or shall we just leave the pots because we know already what's in there
we could use the stickers for something else „ couldn't we
you wanna them in the pot
well in that case it's a space to write the name
so shall we go to the table and write your name
no
okay
well you put whichever sticker you like on whichever pot
that's it
you put that in the blue one
right
that one in the red one
that's nice
Tom aren't you clever
I just
you're a good boy
I just realized what you've done
you've put the green one that says Teletubbies in the green pot
you've put the one with the bunny rabbit that's on the yellow card in the Lala pot
you've put one with all the TinkyWinkys on the purple background into the purple pot
and you've put the one with the yellow flowers growing on the red card in the red pot
every single color matches up
aren't you a clever
it's a little wire twist off something
I think that's ever so clever
because I wouldn't have even realized that those colors matched
and I should know what I'm doing
you are a good boy
now I'm going to get a cloth
just going to wipe each pot
nice and dry
and then I think we can stand them outside
shall we put them onto the table
the patio table

well we'll just wipe them all and I then I think we could do with finding a little
yes
we could do with finding a tray for them all to stand in
I think
so they all stay together

now let me just think where I could get a tray from
I can't just now think
so perhaps we'll hafta come back to this one
no
I don't think Purdie would be very happy if we used her tray
I tell you what we can use
I've just thought about it
let me wash my hands and I'll go in the fridge
right
let's have a look in the fridge
because in the fridge we've go these strawberries
oops
or even this one
look
look at this little tray with the cherry tomatoes in it
now that's nice clear plastic so we can see what's in it
do you think there's room there for all the pots to stand in or not
you can hold it darling
course you can
look at that
just big enough
isn't that lovely
there
now you have a look at that
oh wow
shall we take it outside
shall we carry it outside
you hold it very carefully
that's right
we'll go to the door
no
but I needta come to the door and check you get down the steps safely
alright
you pop it on the table
right
let's go back in now
oh Tom
it's no good telling me to go away darling
I'm not going to go away
oh no
come on
I know
you're frustrated because you wanted to do it all on your own and
look
look
isn't that great
from in here we can see all four pots
now when they start flowering
I've forgotten when it said they were going to start to show their flowers
let's read the packet again
now we're going to hafta remember to keep going out with that Teletubby watering can and give them a water
otherwise they won't grow „ will they
right
what does it say
it says sowing between March and May
well it's March now „ isn't it
pardon
it's Monday
well it's Thursday actually
but it's a Thursday in March
right
and it says keep moist and weed free at all times
flowers June to September
no
we haven't any flowers now
but June to September I hope we're not in Spain when they start flowering or we'll miss them
June to September
so we've got to keep those pots there and if it looks like it's going to be a very frosty night I think Mummy'll bring them in
but we'll hafta keep going outside and if it as not been raining it'll have had no water from the rain
we've got to go out with your Teletubby watering can
and we've got to water
no
we've just
we've just watered them
we don't needta do that
you wanna put your coat on your wellies and go outside „ do you
and plant them
we've planted them already
we've got to wait till June
we've got to get through April and May
we've got to go through two nearly three months before you'll see any flowers
now what I suggest we do now

you haven't got any whiskers
how about you have a drink of milk
nice drink of milk and Mummy might have a cup of tea
and then I suggest that we walk to the shop
ah but you've planted them outside
we've carried them outside
they're outside now
what I was going to say we'll go to the shop

we'll go and buy some nice Polyanthums because when Mummy was getting ready for your Teletubby pot I potted
I'll get it right in a minute
I put some compost in the flower pot
so that when we come back with some Primulas or Polyanthums or whatever they're called from the greengrocer we can plant those
what do you say to that
yes please mister duh duh duh
but we've got to use our legs and walk to the shop to buy them first
the only thing is I've just realized it's Monday
and they might not be open on a Monday
what am I talking about
it's Thursday
I know
oh dear
Mummy's on another planet
what am I talking about
my mind just completely gone then Thomas
I don't know
you're putting the seed packet on my face

you're putting it across my mouth and I can't talk
poor Mummy

you're putting it across my mouth and I can't talk

we needta keep that seed packet actually „ don't we
because
I bet you find that funny
look at this nice little garden on the back
look at this
wow
it says Teletubby's gardening set
it as got four flower pots
four
a watering can
four seed tags
a trowel
a packet of seeds and a reusable storage bag
so what I suggest is that we store the watering can and the trowel
shh
and the empty seed packet in here
and everytime you wanna do some gardening you know where your little pot is „ don't you
why are you putting your hand on my bottom
to keep me nice and safe
that's a funny thing to do „ isn't it
right
there you are

bye bye
I don't know what you've gone for
are you getting the tractor
oh right
oh right
that's lovely
no I can't
we've played this before „ haven't we
the tractor's here
well just thinking about tractors and trailers who drives tractors
men
farmers
let's just
right
just a minute
let
we were talking about planting things
what happened after we planted them
shall we sit on the settee
do you not
do you want me to sit here
okay
listen
we planted those seeds „ didn't we
pardon
a digging log
what's a digging log
say that again
you dig up the sword like that
who comes to see me
a little snake
oh I'm glad you didn't dig that deep in that compost
and what happened
it was a shame because we walked all the way to the fruit shop „ didn't we
and the man was open „ wasn't he
but what did the lady say to you
the lady in the fruit shop
she hadn't got any plants left „ had she
she said the nice weather had brought everybody out to buy the bedding plants
well not bedding plants but primroses and Primulas
and she hadn't got any left „ had she
she said what
she said what
two daffodils
I didn't hear her say anything like that
can I see anything red or green
yes
I can see your bicycle Thomas
no
don't turn that on
is he
hello fireman
so listen
because the lady in the fruit shop hadn't got any plants
we were hoping to come back and plant some primroses „ weren't we
in that tub that we ad got compost in
but we couldn't do it „ could we
and she said she's going to get some in the next couple of days
so we've got to go back „ haven't we
and buy some more
listen
the caravan
and then as we left the fruit shop we went to that other shop „ didn't we
the shop on the corner
the one that we've not been too before
we got some sweeties
yes
there was a funny boy in there „ wasn't there
well I think for a start he thought you were older than you were because when the lady who was well serving me said something I said oh he's not three yet I don't think he understands
and they both said he's not three
he's a big boy
and the little boy said and my brother's two
and he's a lot smaller and he's not saying anything
but that boy kept staring at you „ didn't he
I think he was trying to play PeepBo with you Thomas
but you were a little bit frightened of him „ weren't you
you were shy
yes
because he kept pulling silly faces at you „ didn't he
and he kept following you round the shop making silly faces
and we bought some milk
and sweets because you ad been the best boy ever
and we walked home
what did you find on the pavement when we were walking home
a daffodil
and as we walked along you said what's in it
meaning the stalk „ didn't you
and you said it's like an onion inside
now I think you're getting confused with
well AuntieMabel
because AuntieMabel and Pippin were talking one day about bulbs „ weren't they
do you remember they were planting
daffodils
she did
AuntieMabel got a very sharp knife
and she said don't do this at home
and she cut the bulb inside „ didn't she
to look inside
and what did she say
she said it looks more like an onion inside
yes
you're quite right
what did she say
there's lot of goodness stored in here
meaning the bulb
that's what makes the daffodil grow
oh that's right
it showed a big machine in the field „ didn't it
cutting all the daffodils down and once they were ready to be harvested it cut them down
and then they were packed in the factory
can you remember how many daffodils were packed in a bunch
how many
lots
she said they're packed in bunches of twenty
and then they were boxed
they had labels on them „ didn't they
which said English daffodils
and then they went into those boxes into the storeroom
and what was the storeroom like
it was very
it was very cold
it wasn't a cold day it was very cold inside that storeroom to keep the daffodils fresh
and then you saw big lorrys backing up to the back of the storage shed
and the doors were open and all the boxes were loaded into the back of the lorrys
and they were taken away „ weren't they
to go to the shops to be sold
we've bought some daffodils „ haven't we
have we got daffodils in the garden
we've got more than one
look
what's in the vase up there
lotsof daffodils
and what about the vase over there
there's lotsof daffodils
and what else have you seen AuntieMabel grow
oh do you remember the dandelion story
well there's still another story about daffodils that we know „ isn't there
because do you remember that plot of daffodils
that little patch of daffodils
and they were all opening up
all apart from one
and they kept saying why don't you open daffodil
and what did it say
I'm frightened
I'm shy
like you in the shop
it was saying I'm shy
I'm shy
I'm frightened that when I open up my petals might not be right
and
and when
and when the daffodil
I can't see a crocodile
no
and when the daffodil opened up it was a beautiful daffodil
and they were all saying to it you're a beautiful daffodil
and then it went red „ didn't it
because it was embarrassed
is the crocodile coming to see Mummy
that's nice
that's lovely
ah that's beautiful
now listen
what was the other one that AuntieMabel and Pippin talked about
that was the dandelion
do you remember that
that's another flower beginning with d
and what happened there
AuntieMabel and Pippin had a day in London „ didn't they
and they went to see the tower
and they found even amongst the city where there are lotsof cars there were some daffodils
not daffodils dandelions growing
and Pippin went to smell one of the dandelion clocks
and the little seeds went up his nose and he went aitchoo
and as he sneezed the dandelion clock went everywhere „ didn't it
all over his coat
and when he came home they were walking up the garden path and AuntieMabel went oh Pippin you're covered in dandelion
and she brushed him
and the seeds fell in the soil and later on a patch of dandelions grew
and do you remember
she said I don't need it what
she said I don't need it in my kitchen floor
is that why she brushed him outside
and that's why the seeds fell in some soil
and what was the story she told then
that was about some lilys
do you remember the lilys
they were beautiful gorgeous flowers and they were very proud of themselves
saying they were the nicest flowers
we're sweet smelling we're beautiful
and you dandelions are just weeds
and then the lady of the house walked out „ didn't she
with her gardening things
and the lilys were laughing saying haha she as come to dig up the weeds
but actually she ad come with some scissors to go
snip snip snip on the lilys
and then she took the lilys inside
and they were in a vase looking out
they were inside the house looking out at the dandelions who were enjoying the sun and the rain
the dandelions stayed there for years
whereas the lilys died „ didn't they
the lilys
do you remember those beautiful big tall white flowers
do you remember them
you can't remember
duhduhduh lilys
right
Mummy's just going to pour herself that cup of tea
and then I've got something to show you
oh you wait
I'll show you in a minute
no
no
no
no
no
no
they're not about any of those things
it's this
would you like to take that to the table please
no
it isn't a tape
take it to the table and we'll have a look at it
let's open it to see what's inside

what's these
well I shall show you in a minute
let me show you what they do
well
you can do it in a minute when you know the story
now you're going to hafta help me on this one Thomas
because I'm not sure I can remember it
do you remember the story about the three little pigs
you don't remember that one
I don't remember it very well
I wish it had come with a story
that would have been helpful „ wouldn't it
do you not remember the story about the three little pigs

because I can't remember it
I'll hafta go and find a nursery book
nursery storybook
but look
yes
you blow
that's right
I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in
is that what the fox said
well that's as far as I remember it
there were three little pigs
and they built their house with straw
and the fox came along and he said
I'll huff and I'll
and I'll
yeah
they were frightened
the next little pig built his house with sticks
and along came the fox and he said
yes
I'll huff and I'll puff and blow your house down
now the third little pig built his house with strong bricks
and the fox came along and he said
and he huffed and he puffed
and he huffed and he puffed
and he huffed and he puffed
and he blew
nothing happened
because the house of bricks stayed where it was
and the only thing I can remember is that the pig had a huge cooking pot on the fire below
and the fox thought he was very clever
and he climbed up the roof of the brick house and he peered down the chimney
and he thought I'll get in by going down the chimney
and he went down the chimney straight into the pot of stew
and that's the end of mister fox
