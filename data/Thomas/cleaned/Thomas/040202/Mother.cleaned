alright there
Thomas
why did you say oyq
you can play with them as long as you promise to pick them up but then you'd get fed up at the end „ wouldn't you
you can play with a few but then
absolutely got
alright
they've got to go back in the box at the end
is that alright
but before we do that I want you to just have a little look at this and
oh

you have
you're going to eat your dog food
what's your dog called
tsk don't be sillybilly
oh Thomas don't do that
it's dirty
don't put it in your mouth
this is a box we've got „ isn't it
and they look almost like cheesy whatsits „ don't they „ but instead of yellow colored like cheesy whatsit they're cream colored
no don't put them
no just stand there
strange „ isn't it
it almost smells like popcorn
but it's packing material „ isn't it
from this box
it's a sort of polystyrene
but that other one
mm it doesn't smell that nice
that other one looked a bit damaged though
there was sort of sticky stuff from the „ wasn't there
smells like a burnt meringue
can you smell it
could you just pass the drawing thing Thomas
we'll do this first and get this out of the way
no if you're wearing a show
please
yes
yes
with your fingernail as well
it's one of these magic slates that we're using „ isn't it „ to write with
no you're getting a little bit confused with the letters
b and d
no that's p
b d and p
d
d
b and d
that's right
right well the trick is learning
now are you going to sit next to me
just get your little stool please
the trick is working out which is d and which is b
we won't bother with p now we'll just deal with d and b
right
no you imagine all that is in a line Thomas
all that is from a right through to z in a line
now in the alphabet if you say a b c d
mhm hm
right please Thomas
will you just listen to what I was saying
this is concentration
this is learning to do
why I always tell your Daddy off for doing this because your Daddy can only do one job at a time and I lots
but
what I want you to do now
is not to do lotsof jobs just to concentrate on one job
and the one job is learning b and d
so don't look at anything else we'll play in a minute
you imagine all the letters in a line
now if we say a b c d
very good
do you wanna say that again
no
okay
oh is it not raining „ is it
is it raining
no I don't think so
it's just I've got some washing out
I think it possibly is you know
I think it might be
let me just see if there's any drops of water on the path
perhaps it's just a little bit of dirt
sounded like raindrops „ didn't it
right so you imagine all the letters in a line Thomas
now b
does b come before d if you say all
you say
no
oh no
if you're doing a b c d
if you're doing a b c d does b come before d
does b come before d
no
oh
well you just say it again
just a little
yes
yeah
right so what came first
the b or the d
yeah but after a what came
no
right
so if you imagine all the letters in a line
okay
you're going to come across a b
now what can you see on that b
an up
now the up thing
you imagine walking into a line of letters
but you just step over the a
but you bump into the b
that's what the b stands for
I bumped into b
what's the bit that you bumped into
that bit sticking up there
so you remember a line of letters and the very first thing you step over the a and the next thing you bump into that barrier
b for bump
b for barrier
that's your b
now further along the alphabet you step over the c because the c is little like a
it's got no bits sticking up
and then bother me you bump into the d
the d
and the bit you bump into is
is that one
so can you remember
yeah
can you think
do you think you can remember that
you're walking along and you bump into that barrier
that's b
so the b
you recognize b because it's got the barrier first and then the circle
okay a barrier first and then a circle
you step over the c and then you come to the d and you're doing really nicely
so you get over that roundy bit and the you bump into d
what can we call that danger sign
d for danger
what
no but we
oh yes
but beginning with d
for diversion sign
it's something
diver
but something stops you
and it start
right
a diver's fall
but either the b has the barrier first
the d has the barrier at the end
so you stepped over that and you bump into that and it
ow danger
d for danger
now what's that little rhyme that we made up
we were drawing a bed „ weren't we
we've got a little bed made up of b at the beginning and d at the end
okay
b has the barrier here
d has the barrier there
put them all to bed together with a
e in the middle
what do you have
d
bed
so you
this magic slate isn't very good
you imagine a bed
that's your nice bed
okay
and there you are
at the pillow end you've got the b
and at the bottom end you've got the d
it would „ wouldn't it
but can you imagine a bed Thomas made of
it's Daddy now
the b there the e and then the d
yeah
b e d
which one's b for bouncing Ben
which one's d for dizzy duck
very good
very good
we've finished doing that now
alright then
Daddy's here now
yes
no go back to your
I was just thinking of other things Thomas
where's your bus
right
put that on the bus because that's a b for bus
are you the bus driver
right well you wear that badge because what's that one
d for
driver
yeah d for but d for driver
you could be the d driver and that could be the b bus
alright
and guess what
you know you got a bit confused with the p
the p
this p
do you know what this could be
passengers
p for passengers
oh it's getting confusing
so look at that
we've got b for bus
the bus has got to wear that badge
d for driver
you've got to wear that badge
you're a d
and I'm a passenger
I'm a
p
so I'm p
you're a purple d
and the bus
bus is a blue
b
b for bus
d for driver
p for passenger
yes
is it
oh
right everytime we say one of these words like bus driver or passenger I've got to hold up one of these
okay
no I know but we're just learning
well we can still play as well
do what you
no don't get upset
do what you want but I'm just saying
come on you play and I'll play with you
oh no
it's b broken down
we'll hafta put it in the d dustbin

thank you
yes please
no the bus hasta say broombroombroom berber broombroombroom
oh that's a nice blue
very good
oh yes
smashing
no you're not
what are you doing
pushing the
pushing the bus through the car wash
the bus wash
and what are all those things on the floor
well
this is handy because you know we say p for passengers
well what's that on the floor
it's packing
p packing out of the b box
isn't it
are those the passengers then
so one could be p passengers and others could be p pebbles on the floor
your tickets
right
oh are we playing with the game where we hafta have tickets
you suddenly like games with playing tickets „ don't you
hello
hello bus driver
b d
bus driver
why didn't you say depot
then it could have been d for depot
p for parking place
p ark
right
very good
oh I say there's some good parking sounds
how many floors have you got
two
right
well shall I go all the way to the top please
because when we go to the airport I go to the top
we see all the planes „ don't we
Thomas p planes
broom
goodness me that's a funny noise
does that mean you've reached the top
what's that
it's a barrier
careful
barrier
oh no what's that falling down on the ground there
oh a ramp
right where there's
oh no well that's going to cause a problem
well if I've just come down the ramp of the car park
it looks like my ticket's flown out of the car window
oh right I see
because I was thinking surely I'll need the ticket to get out of the car park „ won't I
right
thank you
oh very
what's happening to the ticket now
punching holes
punching
yeah
we're learning to spell
aren't we
I did
it's very springy actually those tickets
these little foam shapes that we're using as tickets the pacing out of the box
they're very springy „ aren't they
are you concentrating
thank you
be careful Thomas

otherwise you'll break the barrier
b d
I tell you what it's taking a jolly long time to get out of your car park with this ticket machine
it's all a bit complicated „ isn't it
it's coming down in the lift
right is that a return ticket
a return ticket
do you know what one of those is Thomas
you come back on the same ticket
you save the ticket
you keep the ticket you were given
and the little guard punches it once to say you've made one journey and then punches it again when you make the return journey
is it
closed
right okay
mhm hm
oops
your bus has had a bump
it
that's right
b u s instead of b u p
ah won't quite go in sideways
you're trying to get the bus into the little truck „ weren't you
be careful
bash as well
that's another good b word
would it go in this EarlyLearningCentre truck Thomas
no
j
right is that necessary information
why is that
why do you needta know my name
the police are going to check if I'm a robber or not
do I look like a robber
do I
why do I look like a robber
Thomas
now what's that got to do with anything
my stripy top on
yes please
right down comes the lift
like inceywincey spider
oh right
right just hold on one moment I've just got to say something to Daddy
right okay
no now don't throw that on the floor
come pick it up please
Thomas
come and pick it up
thank you
you don't say naughty things Tom
pardon
I will
right so shall we pretend this is a game like a Tombola
so let's pretend
well I'm not looking at the box
so I won't close my eyes
let's pretend I'm at the Tombola
right I pick something out
what is it
oh what letter's that
no it isn't
yes
how do you tell it's a b
the what
right
something else
this is material now
you've obviously some letter shapes
can you spell
be careful they're going all over the floor
ah what's this one
p
and what have you found
what have
what have you found
what's that
d
so it's really just that one we get confused with
right what do I need now out
oh and what's that begin with
b

very good
oh right here's my ticket
thank you
right is that a return ticket again that I've bought
well that's good
thank you
oh goodness me
that's a lot of money
stay in the car park
two minutes
don't put it in your mouth Tom please
rush to work
can you imagine
box box sits like that
I think that would be great
they do smell definitely of something foody though „ don't they
it's that sort of smell that you get with popcorn
can you remember
we've not had popcorn for a long time „ have we
in fact I don't think I've every bought you popcorn
but do you remember when Samara's sister
cooked some popcorn last year
we had a little bit then
mhm
oh you found a car in there
it's my car
what's my car doing in all that packing

oh it's that cheeky ticket man
car park barrier man
pardon
oh it's squash a fludge and not a budge
what do you mean
it won't squash at all
well that's because it's a battery
it's a spare battery for the machine and batteries are made of hard material „ aren't they
you can't crush that
do you remember on the way back today you were asking me what breaks roads
and I was saying things like drills
I suppose if you drop something really heavy like a huge boulder on the road that would cause a bit of a hole
oh boulder b
that would cause a bit of a problem
yeah in fact that's the battery
remember that's the new battery
we might need that
oh guess what
we need it
I thought it was time to change the battery
look
what's happened to the light

oh goodness
well look you're going to hafta play with the old battery because I need the new one
please
couldn't remember whether I'd changed it or not
there you are
could we swap over please
thank you
well not really
I don't think they're very good things to play with batteries
the end of the game I'll hafta put it in
that's what
no don't Thomas
because we might think it's a new one
there we are
yes
oh the battery
could I just have it please and I'll put this little rubber end stopper on
yeah as long as you don't put it in your mouth because that's the sort of thing that is small enough for you to swallow
what else is made of rubber
I am playing
I was just asking what was made of rubber tyres
yeah tyres and wheels on the bus
the wheels on the bus are made or rubber
made of rubber
made of rubber
what else rubber
rubber shoes rubber bands
Wellingtons are a sort of rubber „ aren't they
do you
what sort of announcements are you making
you don't know
I will

that's a very good announcement voice that
you see a jumbo jet
where do you see a jumbo jet
can you see it or can you just hear it
it's not a very nice day
it's a bit dull today „ isn't it
it's not raining
where
oh wow yes
gosh was that „ didn't it
jolly loud
oh are we a supermarket now
car park
right
that is a little bit like the airport then Thomas „ isn't it
because the car park really where we can stand and watch the planes go there's a little aviation shop there where you can buy toy aeroplanes and postcards and things
so there's bound to be a till there „ isn't there
pardon
oh I see so you put it on the service ramp
and is the little man going to have a look underneath
see what the problem is
and what's the problem
no petrol
oh dear so you hadta get it on the service ramp to discover it had no petrol
do you remember that red car we passed today where the man had bonnet up
what was inside it
mhm petrol tank
there was all sorts of things
did you see all the wires and leads
and what did you think there was inside
that there was a fire extinguisher
I don't think it would be actually
I think it was something to do with the oil but it was red „ wasn't it
I thought that man's car had broken down but he said it was something to do with fluid for the battery
that was leaking
l leaking from the b battery
in the k a r
in the red car
what made you suddenly say post van
oh p for post van

ow you're hurting me
there's a tram
oh
a hundred quid
mhm
some some are one pence some are nine ninety nine and some are a hundred quid
hundred pounds please
well there's a lot of difference between buying that for a penny and buying that for a hundred pounds „ isn't there
is one made of gold or silver
gold
is that why it's so expensive
what's your bus made from
china
oh let's have a look
I've never seen a china bus before
let's hope we don't have a crash because if we do what will happen
smash
oh look at the seats
what color are they
blue
and look you can go up the blue steps to the top
oh
yes please
how much did you say that was
nine ninety nine
right
oh I see the masking tape from the bottom of the box has just got stuck to your socks
oh you can wrap it with pleasure
yes please
let me count out
one two
I'm using these little packing bits now as money
one two three four
five
six seven
oh no don't do that please
I want to keep that box

don't play with the box Thomas
no well just leave it please exactly as it is
no don't try that with the box
I want the box intact
thank you
one two three four five six seven eight nine
now if I give you ten pounds
and it's nine ninety nine can I have one penny change please
well that's your ten pounds
could I have one penny please
oh well might you
oh you're a very good shopper
nine ninety nine
oh how much is that
oh I see
so you've given me one hundred pennies back
that's a pound
actually I only needed one pence so that's
so it's only cost me eight ninety nine
there you are
or nine pounds
so you only give me a pound back
right could I put all my money down please on the counter because I'm going to drop them
put it in the box where what darling
you keep all the money in the box „ do you
no I should hope not because you don't want robbers coming to the shop „ do you

well that's because you've got nice things in your shop and you have a lot of customers and everybody buys things
at the end of the day you'll have an awful lot of money in your shop „ won't you
sorry
what do you mean qqqq
yes
a gift voucher shop
we've still got some gift vouchers
we usually
yes please
oh yes I don't think you can use that inside „ do you
is that your pogo stick
are you having a little rest now
now when you're having a rest from your shop what do you need
you don't drive a bus or anything „ do you
course you do what
do you
oh that sounds far more sensible then driving a bus „ doesn't it
do you
well it is tea time „ isn't it „ now
would you like
what sort of sandwich would you like
a cheese sandwich
okay
if you're cheese sandwiches darling we've got some coleslaw left
not coleslaw pasta salad
I might have some coleslaw as well but definitely got pasta salad
and would you like some fruit
I tell you what we'll find some nice fruit for you
I'd quite like some cheesy whatsits after I've seen that box
I know they're not really cheesy whatsits but mm
what are you drawing now Thomas
goodness me
that's quite a lot „ isn't it
very good
I think a lot of people must have brought buses „ don't you
sorry
oh the packet
oh
is it
no it's not
well I think it's the bottom of the box „ isn't it
it's not actually coming out of the bottom of the box but
the bottom of the box on the inside has a little flap „ hasn't it
and I think some of the packing must have gone in the flap
oh what was that big bang then
well no it sounded like Daddy dropped something upstairs or
is it Daddy coming downstairs perhaps
did you hear it as well
watch your fingers in that door please
no don't take that out Thomas
you need that for the sheds
do you mean the airport hangers
the airport hangers rather
what do we call it where the trains sleep at night
shed
the engine shed
that's right
and what do we call it where the aircrafts sleep
a hanger
and what do you call it where a bus sleeps
a depot
and what do we call where a car sleeps
good
what do we call it where you sleep
a b e d a bed
in a bedroom in a house
are you going to go to bed in this house
are you going to go to bed nice and early tonight
are you
how early
nice o'clock
that's not early
have you been tired today
I had an awful
are you
I had an awful job to get you out of bed this morning
you were a tired boy
it's
do you remember we were giggling last night when we should have been asleep
alright what are you doing in the stockroom
right well don't get too many things out please
it sounds like the airport Thomas
I can hear another aeroplane
it sounds like the airport
I can hear another aeroplane
what are you getting
well you can stand it up on something on the garage „ can't you
no it is not
this is a ladybird like Jeannine has „ isn't it
oh is it too steep
it's a bit too steep „ isn't it
let's find something not quite so steep
yes
Jeannine will recognize this
this is
what happened there
oh no it's not the Thomas
it's not right „ is it
let me have a go
let me find somewhere to put it
yes
is it
now you are playing now or you were playing with a plank of wood
Jeannine useta have some characters
what sort of characters did Jeannine have
did she have a ladybird the same
and what else did she have
it's a plank of wood that props up and a ladybird walks down it
and then when we went to the post office in HeatonMersey we found the very same toy
so we found the very same toy so we bought one
they had a ladybird and a wooden dog „ didn't they
and we bought the ladybird one
I keep thinking actually Thomas that would make a nice present for either Abigail or Sarah
because I'd thought of them when I bought yours I actually thought that would make a nice present but then
did you not notice when UncleStuart and AuntieVal came
this is Abigail's and Sarah's parents
UncleStuart said oh I like that
so I thought even more that would be a very nice present „ wouldn't it
it is
but what happened to yours
it didn't break
the piece of wood that props the plank of wood up
you put on Nana's bag „ didn't you
and it went missing
do you remember that
the battery
very good thinking
that just raises it up a little bit „ doesn't it
oh I tell you where I think we're going wrong
I think you hafta start it at the other end Thomas „ don't you

oh is that what the barrier is for at the bottom
right off you go ladybird
oh there you are
clickclick
it's doing a little dance „ isn't it
I think it's lovely
so do you think Abigail and Sarah would like one of those
are you going to knock it off the battery
how many spots has the ladybird got
six you good boy
I expected you to say three and I was going to say what about the other side
and then when you'd said three again I was going to say add the two together and what do you get
but you counted six immediately „ didn't you
oh dear I think that ladybird's had some wine Thomas
why a gentleman
you're a gentleman

oh yes ladybird that's why it's called a ladybird
it's not a gentleman bird „ is it
so Thomas who's told you that gentlemen collapse when they've had wine
I have not
is this a story you've read or something you've seen on television
did I
my goodness
no
no don't be rough Thomas please
what are you trying to do
knock it off it's perch
oh that's not very nice „ is it
poor ladybird
no I don't think you're being nice now
no
I needta go in a moment and ring Rachel's Mummy before it gets too late
do you
no don't do that again please
you'll break
do you remember me asking you to remind me
you can have your tea now
yes
no I've been bitten
my leg
it's walking across the common
well I think a little insect
I didn't actually feel it at the time but when we'd had a walk on the common I came back and my legs have got lotsof little bites on „ haven't they
and they're very itchy
mhm
that's right
this is the delights of my body
I've got insect bites on one leg
and I've got hard skin on my heels
and what's happened to this leg
a big scratch all the way down it and I honestly don't know how I did that
breakfast
it's a bit silly because it's teatime but okay we'll do that
I'll get it ready and then we'll talk a few minutes more while you're having your tea „ shall we
that's fine
will you
oh could I go in the stock room with you
because I'm so nice
oh yes
what can we do in the stock room together
eat

oh
yeah
there's your money and there's your basket
goodness me
it is a lot of stock „ isn't it
right I'll just tea ready
okay there's the towel
you have
well that's why I give them to you
it reminded me
there you are there's cheese sandwiches cheesy whatsits
yes
no no I don't
don't eat the white ones
right pasta salad
okay
I'll make you a drink
there you are
does that sound good
I think I might have crackers and cheesy whatsits actually Tom
it's a long time since I've had any
let's make a drink before you
are you very hungry today
why is that
because you are
right
there you are
that's your meal
how's that
just check you can get a drink out of that spout
is it working
no
it worked fine before „ didn't it
there's some problem with it
I'll think we'll have another try please
I don't know what the matter is
oh it's very hard certainly
just try again
no
okay I'll pop it into a beaker for you
okay
what do you say
that's better
I'll hafta try and take the lid off this beaker without
because now press the lid on really

really hard
there we are
just be careful because that's the last of the juice now
try not to spill it
I'll just get a cloth to mop up that little bit
how's that
there we are
do some washing up in a little while
but I shall sit with you and have my packet of cheesy whatsits I think
is that a nice tea
is the salad nice
no I'm going out for a meal later „ aren't I
well I'm eating much later on
which is why it's a long time till I'm going to eat so I'll have a tiny snack
although I mustn't eat much or I won't eat my meal
what
oh I won't
I won't tell anybody I've had a little snack
it's only a tiny snack though one bag of crisps „ isn't it
it's now about six o'clock and I'm not eating till half past eight so I think
by the time I eat it'll be late
mm
we can't talk now because we're eating „ aren't we
it's quite a while since you had
are you
it's quite a long time since you've had a cheese sandwich
you must have been hungry because you've eaten one quickly
are you very hungry
and thirsty
when you were driving that bus you said you were going to have a sandwich „ didn't you
watch out because that cheese is going to fall Thomas
eat over your plate Tom
I do sometimes
pardon
big plonk of cheese
do you mean block
or slice
a big plonk you said
mhm
well I very often grate it
but today I didn't bother getting the grater on so I just quickly sliced it up and popped it on your sandwich
which I thought was alright
oh these are nice
I've not had these for a long time
it says ingredient maizesspa
it's like a cereal
vegetable oil real cheese powder
whey powder
that means something to do with milk
salt herb extract and the color is tsk paprika
and it says
no d like Dimitra
yeah paprika
but it says the cheesy flavor corn puffs
the only ones that I really like Thomas
I don't actually know whether they sell them any more but
when I was young
when I useta go on the bus with NanaBealby into York
we useta go to Marks and Spencers and they had they were like cheesy puffs
I think they were called cheesy puffs
but instead of being shaped like these whatsits they were round balls
they tasted just the same
perhaps a little bit more cheesy but they were big round balls
ooh
it were gorgeous
but they came in quite big bags and one bag was a little bit too much to eat in one go
mhm
it was a lot bigger than these little packets
when we next go to Marks and Spencers remind me
it says on the advert they're big cheesy and crunchy

they are crunchy „ aren't they
crunch
chomp
can you
well they don't taste sweet as if they've got sugar „ do they
they're savory
things that aren't sweet are savory
does it
does it tingle a bit
mhm
well vinegar and salt can both do that to you „ can't they
they can make your lips tingle
oh it's a miserable day
it's just doing nothing „ is it
at school it was pouring down
when
it did not
I haven't seen any rain today
when I came to pick you up from school it nowhere was wet at school
I don't think so Thomas
where have the logs gone from school
there was one big sort of tree trunk there „ wasn't there
have the logs been taken away
yes
were they
but they weren't there at home time „ were they
well I tell you what happened actually
a little girl broke her arm yesterday
did you hear about this
mhm
a little girl broke her arm
playing on the hill
and I just wondered with the logs being taken away now whether
that has something to do with
you heard MrsJohnson say she was taking the logs away
did you hear why she was taking the logs away
no
I just wondered whether it was just something that they do or whether they'd taken them away because perhaps that little girl
I don't know where she was when she fell and hurt herself
I didn't know she'd hurt herself at the time
it was much later on when they realized it was serious
and guess what
her arm's in a sling now
like that
she hadta go to the hospital
mhm
I don't think she was playing a trick „ do you
I don't think you're playing a trick when you pretend to break your arm
or at least you're not playing a trick if you do really break your arm
if you pretend to break your arm yes
but if you've really broken your arm then it's not a trick „ is it
bet it's painful
you've done what
what
a fatty
oh Thomas
well what do you say
no excuse me please
that's very rude
that's very rude Thomas
are you not going to say excuse me please
no don't be rude
it's not nice „ is it „ saying that
I don't think it's very nice anyway
does that drink taste extra special in that beaker
with a swirly straw
do you know what that beaker
Thomas just stop being rude at the table
that is you blowing into your straw
now stop that
that's bad manners
put it on the table please
this is a clear plastic beaker
and round the outside is a swirly black straw and it goes all the way round the outside
and then a tube goes up into your mouth
but it obviously goes into the beaker as well and that's how you're able to
it's not doing it now
right okay you've shown me now so put it down please
that's enough of that
I was just saying that beaker reminds me of your garage
you know the ramp coming out of your garage
this is like the swirly bit that goes all round the garage and out at the bottom
only this one it comes out at the top of the drink „ doesn't it
not at the bottom
it's like a car whizzing round the car park and then flying out off the roof
that's right
mhm
shh
well that could be a plane „ couldn't it „ taking off into the sky
onto the airport roof again
no stop it
going to have the rest of your cheese sandwiches now
you ate one very quickly
some more pasta salad
what do you say
so I'll just get a clean spoon to put in the bowl
there you are
pardon
there's some sweetcorn in that as well „ isn't there
I won't put it back in the fridge until
you've had enough
what is it love
yes well there's different shapes of pasta in that
isn't there
spirals and there's something else
I'm not quite sure what the other
it's just two different sorts of pasta we've used
it does look like a dog bone
I thought that
I'm sure it won't be a dog bone
it looks very much like it „ doesn't it
right I think I'll put this bread back in the bread bin before it goes dry
oh
Max on the Tweenies
yeah
he was moving something and pop went on him
what was pop
oh Thomas stop it
I don't think so
I find that hard to believe that they would have something like that on the Tweenies
mind you did you hear about Granddad in Stockport yesterday
did Nana not tell you
what happened to Granddad
a bird pooed on his head
it was quite funny „ wasn't it
I'm sure I wouldn't have been laughing if it was me but because it wasn't me I found it quite
it's sposta bring you luck
no Thomas
Thomas stop doing that
it's sposta bring you good luck Thomas when that happens to you
but I don't think I would find it very lucky „ would you
right come on now finish drink
right come on
sandwich please
because I want you to finish your sandwich
it's only a little bit of cheese „ isn't it
must have been traveling up the straw when you sucked it
mustn't it
must have been going whoo all the way up to the top
yes that's right when you pulled your mouth away it carried on spurting up „ didn't it
you love me
ah that's nice
I love you
oh
I want you to eat it please
I'll have a tiny mouthful
and then I want you to eat all the rest
because there's nothing else after tea
that's it
thank you
okay
I can put a piece of ham in if you want cheese and ham
no
just cheese
whose sandwiches are triangle shaped
