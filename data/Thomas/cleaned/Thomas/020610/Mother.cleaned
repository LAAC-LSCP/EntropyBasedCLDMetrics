and when Mummy tidies up she puts all the cars in one box

so I suppose I shouldn't grumble
you really should tidy up before going to bed „ shouldn't you
mhm

oh that's clever
you've just learned how to clip the fire engine and the police car together „ haven't you

there was a funny noise sounding from the tape recorder but I've just checked it and all the lights are working
I don't know quite what happened
you see this Thomas
that's the fireman's hose
that's the hose on the fire engine
that squirts water round
mhm
beeba
water squirts out of there to put the fire out
two wheels blue and red
the fire engine has blue wheels and the police car has red wheels
and they both say beeba „ don't they
we haven't got an ambulance „ have we
you like playing with that police car at Isabelle's house „ don't you
mhm
a big one and a baby one
well it's a police car that's operated by a battery
and it goes on it's own „ doesn't it
and it's saying beeba
and when it bumps into something it flips over and turns into a racing car
and then it makes a different sound and goes very quickly
it's a nice toy „ isn't it
they're coming to talk to Mummy „ are they
oh dear
I don't like it when policemen come talk to me
it must mean I've done something wrong

Thomas
if you don't wanna be still eating breakfast when Nana and Granddad arrive you ad better hurry up I think „ don't you
they've come to put the fire out
well I've just put a piece of toast in to cook
so if it doesn't pop up and it catches fire you tell FiremanSam
I might very well need his services
it's hot
yes
we're making toast
you telling FiremanSam it's hot
do you think the policeman and the fireman would like a piece of toast
if they've been working very hard
they might be feeling a bit hungry and thirsty „ mightn't they
get out
stop
get out
that's the policeman Thomas
with the blue helmet
and that's the fireman with the yellow helmet
I think they've been driving the wrong vehicles „ haven't they
you telling FiremanSam it's hot
what happens with hot things Thomas
fire
but what else
what can happen to you if you touch something hot
what happens to you
oh are you saying are you hungry
are you hungry
and what are they replying
what are they saying back to you
yes Thomas
we're very hungry we'd like a piece of toast please
is that what they're saying
are you going to have a piece of toast Thomas
you've got to eat something poppet
it's for FiremanSam
well you can share it
FiremanSam's hungry too
gosh I've sliced this bread and it's very thick „ isn't it
I think the entire crew on the fire engines could tuck into that piece of toast it's so thick
because when we're slicing toast Thomas we can slice it very thinly and very thick „ can't we
it's hot
yes
I ad better go and check in a minute that we've got something ironed to wear today
because if not Mummy had better do some ironing „ hadn't she
there you are
there's some toast there
share it with the police and the firemen
it's fruit bread this „ isn't it
fruit bread that we've sliced up to toast
is it nice
mm mm
don't get them too dirty Thomas
oh look

under the table

it's not Purdie
mhm
look can you see him

that's currants and sultanas
can you see these
currants and sultanas
Mummy's what darling
Mummy's sultanas
and Mummy's currants

and when the bread machine goes peep we add the fruit
we mix up the flour and the water and the yeast and the butter
and when it goes beep in we tip the currants and sultanas
you sound a bit snuffily
oh no

good boy
hm
the sun's shining again this morning
not see Thomas
I can see Thomas
he's there
oh I can't now because you've put your hands over your face
I can see you
and Ginger pussy cat as walked away now
think he as gone back home for his breakfast
pardon
Sue's house
yes
you can see Sue's house „ can't you
she as not been opening her curtains „ has she
perhaps it's because she's back at work now
she was on holiday before „ wasn't she
I suppose if she's opening her net curtains she's out of the house a long time people can see in
she as got new curtains „ hasn't she
no
you can't see from here
but she has
we've got a blind across the front of our window „ haven't we
we'll pull that across when we're going out
so that people can't see in
oh we pull it across often when we're in so people can't see in
especially when you're watching Teletubbies in the morning
if the sun's shining we've got to pull the blind across
it's a vertical blind
it's slated „ isn't it
so we can have it fully opened
or we can have it so that we can have a bit of privacy but still see out
or we can have it completely shut
and sometimes when the sun's shining right on the television you can't see Teletubbies „ can you
so we hafta shut it properly
but Sue hasn't got a blind
she as got net curtains
so she as either got to have them shut like she as got at the moment or sometimes she opens a little to let some light in
and she ties them back so they look pretty
did you see that lady walking past
she's wearing a blue hat again „ isn't she
oh no
that's not the lady with the dog called Candy
no
that's her next door neighbor
that lady's called Winifred
and she wears a blue beret in winter
so it must be winter now
because she as got her hat on
Misses blue hat
I shouldn't say that because you'll be calling her that „ won't you
oh look
the policeman as got a yellow hat
a helmet
his isn't a woolly beret „ is it
she wears a woolly blue beret
a woolly blue beret
and she lives next to the lady whose name we don't know with the little dog called Candy
the sandwich
who's going for a sandwich
FiremanSam has blue wheels
and the police car has red wheels
who's going for a sandwich
big bears eat the sandwich
oh
do you think the policeman knows there are big bears out there
not hot
sounded like you said not hotty
oh fruity
oh you good boy
fruity
the crisps have gone
I can't remember telling you you could have crisps for breakfast
did you just help yourself to those crisps
and you opened it
you put it in your mouth and crunched
I know what you did
oh
you're a tinker „ aren't you
I thought Thomas is a tinker
talking to Mummy a moment
what are they saying to me
the policeman's going to the platform to see the train
is he talking to the train driver
and what as the train driver got to say to him
do you think the policeman's looking for somebody
because he as been asking me questions
and he as now gone to talk to the train driver
who as run away
some naughty boys
oh they've run away from the policeman
oh dear
and what have the naughty boys done
they've done something to the police car
what have they done
have they let the tyres down
oh dear
what naughty boys
you're not going to be a naughty boy „ are you
no
the policeman would be cross
you once went into the back of a police van „ didn't you
to have a look round
and what did the policeman say to you
he said
he said what
the bolt on please
oh I don't know what he said
but I know he showed you round the inside of the police van then he said and I never ever wanna see you in the back of one of these again „ didn't he
yes
that's what he said to Thomas
are you going to talk to the train driver
the platform
I think those naughty boys let the policeman's car tyres down and then they ran to the train station jumped on the platform and jumped on the next train „ don't you
yes
I think so
Mummy's just putting the kettle on to make another cup of tea
so if you hear a little bit of noise that's what it is
oh there we are
would you like some raspberries or strawberries
some raspberries
raspberries and strawberries
oh I'm just going to cut them up a little bit
forgotten we ad got these
would you like an apple as well
no
what do you say
good boy
is he not chasing anybody on the platform
there you are sweetheart
raspberries and strawberries
that's nice „ isn't it
like the summer again
because it's autumn
we've still got some sun but it gets a lot cooler
and all the leaves that we watch grow in spring start going brown and beautiful gold and yellowy shades
orangey shades
they fall off the trees and go crunch
well they don't go crunch but that's the noise it makes when we walk through them
they taste nice
green leaves
pardon
what are you saying
you're pointing to the strawberries and saying something
oh your Daddy's naughty
your Daddy told me he ad thrown that chocolate in the bin because it ad melted
he's naughty
he fibbed to me „ didn't he
we bought five bars of chocolate
and Mummy hid them on top of the microwave so that Daddy and you wouldn't find it
and Daddy ad obviously found them
and he told me last night that he ad hadta put five bars of chocolate in the dustbin because I left them on top of the microwave and they ad melted
and I told him off
and I went to check the bin and I couldn't see them
then he said they were right at the bottom
but they're in the fridge
I just found them
they haven't melted at all „ have they
your Daddy as been telling Mummy fibs „ hasn't he
and I think for that when we start eating that chocolate we won't give any to Daddy
are you sharing the raspberries with the policeman
dirty fingers
well yes
raspberries stain your fingers „ don't they
that's what I was saying earlier on
my hands are clean but they've got little marks on that finger

well I'm hoping that we'll be getting some nice winter pansys
because all the hanging baskets that Mummy did in the summer have nearly died now „ haven't they
mind you I suppose they've had
yes
so we're going to get rid of all the old flowers
and plant them with new pansys
yes
red flowers on that mat all fall over
bit of a shock „ wasn't it
when they did that
wonder what made them
wonder whether a bird landed on the hanging basket
because we've heard a bird chirping „ didn't we
cheeping

the policeman's in your hand

on the television the Nana's having a cup of tea
and turning the washing machine on „ is she

and when you tell your children it'll be different again
you'll be able to tell them when you were a little boy we hadta do tape recordings every day

that my Mummy always had me table at the proper time
dinnertime as we useta call it

we still iron „ don't we
oh she's sitting
oh it's a little girl sitting in a chair
she's probably exhausted

you getting ready to get dressed
