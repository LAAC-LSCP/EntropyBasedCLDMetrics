Mummy ironed this shirt last night for Daddy but it looks a bit creased and do you know why

no no choo choos
I've just found ThomasTheTankEngine
I wasn't looking for him but I kicked the chair and there he was
that's the key that winds up the helicopter and racing car
the yellow key
are you singing the train song

are you going to sing it again
you're very good at singing „ aren't you
do you enjoy singing
you went to a music class on Friday „ didn't you
almost forgotten about that
there were ten children in the class and you were the youngest
there was you and two other little boys who were brothers and all the rest were girls
Sarah
no Sarah wasn't one of them
Sarah was the little girl that you met at the wedding last week
I'm talking about the following day on Friday when you went to music class
water
there were seven girls and three little boys and you were one of the little boys
and what did you do at music class
chips
chips
we said hello to the man „ didn't we
and then we all hadta sit down in a circle
and Julian who was running the class had a guitar „ didn't he
and he sat at the front playing his guitar
sometimes he played very quietly then other times he played loudly
sometimes he played slowly and sometimes he played quickly
and we were all singing nursery rhymes and we each hadta get an instrument from the front „ didn't we
and either shake it or rattle it or bang it in time to the music on the beat
and then we did some dancing and skipping round the room
do you remember skipping around the room
singing
and then he brought that huge drum in to the middle of the floor
and everybody gathered round it apart from you because you were a little bit nervous „ weren't you

excuse me
Mummy as got a cough
yes
Daddy as often got a cough „ hasn't he
that's what Daddy does
yes
oh dear mess
you're pulling the trailers apart
and everybody hadta bang on the drum very very loudly and there was an awful noise
a big noise
bang bang bang bang the drum
that's right bang bang bang bang on the drum
and you didn't wanna join in „ did you
and then he said to all the children very quietly now very quietly
and you picked up your drumstick and you went whack
and you gave it a great big bang „ didn't you
and frightened everybody
but he was a really nice man and he didn't tell you off
he was just very pleased that you'd joined in
yes
the moon
what're you doing
you're lying on the floor and you're lifting your legs up and putting them on your play table „ aren't you
are you looking up towards the moon
and then what else did we do in the music class
and right at the end we all hadta lie on the floor and listen to a piece of classical music
but you didn't wanna lie down „ did you
you were busy looking at what everybody else was doing
and then when all the other children were ready to go home you decided to lie down „ didn't you
so you did end up doing what everybody else did in the class but you did it one step behind
you were taking it all in and checking that it was just safe to do it before you had a go
but I don't think anybody minded because
I don't know what you were talking about there
don't kick
but it was your first time „ wasn't it
and we're going to go back next Friday and see how you get on
oh see you bye bye
have you picked up my handbag now
bye bye Thomas
you won't get very far with that because there isn't a lot of money in it
come and help Mummy put all these clothes into this bag
ready for later on when I've got to do the ironing
will you hold the bag
that's right
you hold the bag carefully
carefully
ooh
ooh
there we are
that's all the ironing for later on
let's pop these other things into the bag
there we are
some more trousers and a teeshirt
let's put these coat hangers in as well
because when Mummy as finished ironing she can hang things straight up „ can't she
there we are
all done
all done
right let's put it through there
that's a job for later „ isn't it
alright
yes you put it there by Daddy's shoes
you pop it there
Daddy's shoes
that reminds me Thomas
picking up a bag like that
we've got to remember to put the rubbish out „ haven't we
yes
oh well done Thomas
thank you
what happens on Mondays
that's right
a big truck comes „ doesn't it
to empty all the rubbish
a bang a bang a bang
is that the noise that the trucks make
let's tidy up these newspapers
yes
oh now just leave the bag where it is now Thomas
now pop it there please and let's come in here and shut the door now
we'd better move it from there because if Daddy comes home he's not going to be able to get through the door „ is he
no no
and that won't do „ will it
there we are
we'll move Daddy's newspaper up there
so just coming back to the music class Thomas
I think Mummy saw some musical instruments in one of these books
shall I have a look and see if I can see them
that's very nice
what were you singing then
choo choos
the choo choo song
we useta sing the Teletubbies „ didn't we
TinkyWinky Dipsy LaLa
Po
that's right

oh I'm sure I'd seen it in this book
but the thing was Thomas
aah are you giving Mummy a cuddle
poor NinNin
why poor NinNin
oh poor NinNin
because I've got a bit of a cough
poor NinNin
oh dear
it's only a cough and a cold Thomas
we'll live „ won't we
mhm
not poorly like you were earlier on in the year
oh that wasn't nice „ was it
poor NinNin
we've got some musical instruments „ haven't we
you've got some bells
and you've got a drum and a tambourine
and in fact you've one or two things that we've hidden
because it's a bit loud all the time
we don't have them in the toy box „ do we
poor NinNin
but we can get them out later on today
once we've taken the rubbish out and done one or two of the jobs we could sit and sing some nursery rhymes
look
that's a piano
that's a picture of a piano
snipsnip
yes you can see some red scissors
and cymbals
what do cymbals do
crash
and do you remember the triangle
ding ding ding
the recorder and the violin
look there's a bow there
there's a music book and a drum
tell me what you did with the big drum
piano and recorder
a mouth organ that's new
oh poor NinNin
and a guitar
some drums and a trumpet
and I think that's about it „ isn't it
what's what my darling
it's a parachute
parachute
but you don't hafta buy musical instruments
we could always make our own „ couldn't we
with some dried peas and lentils
oh no don't try and sit up there
you're going to tumble off „ aren't you
no no
no
now Daddy got cross with you „ didn't he
Daddy keeps getting cross with you because you won't sit still in the chairs
and it's not nice „ is it
oh poor NinNin
so I think we could do that
we can get musical instruments out later and play them and sing some songs
and we could make one or two of our own
couldn't we
and what's the other thing we could do
get some wood and things to bang it together
that makes a nice hollow sound
can you see on the mantlepiece the car that you gave Daddy yesterday for father's day
we chose that one because it shows a teddy bear climbing up on to a stool
meow
have you found a picture of a cat
because that's like you „ isn't it
going to get your stool to stand on it to climb up high on things
oh yes it's blue and green paper „ isn't it
yellow paper
and the little teddy on the card is ringing the doorbell
and you like ringing the doorbell „ don't you
what does the doorbell say
pingpong
pingpong
whenever we go anywhere and come home you've got to ring the doorbell „ haven't you
so that's why we chose that card for Daddy
and next to it there's a card that says from your little girl and that was from Purdie to Daddy „ wasn't it
yes because Purdie as lived with Daddy a long time
blue paper
and Daddy looks after Purdie „ doesn't he
feeds her and lets her in the house
white paper
so what did we do yesterday morning
we'd brought Daddy some aftershave „ hadn't we
and some chocolate
and we took him breakfast in bed and we cut one of the red roses from outside the front door „ didn't we
and we took him breakfast in bed with the rose
it's Mummy's magazine
I think it's a picture advertising some mayonnaise or something
it's showing a picture of some vegetables „ isn't it
oh no don't screw the paper up you'll waste it
and when you wanna do some nice drawing and painting you won't have any paper „ will you
why don't you go and find dolly
are you moving the table into the middle of the room
is it a very heavy table
