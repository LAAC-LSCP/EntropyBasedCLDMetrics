dear Jean Peter and Thomas
just a few lines to thank you for the very unexpected Christmas present waiting for me in church last Sunday
Marcus told me there was a parcel addressed to me
well then she says she couldn't go to church on Christmas day
because she ad been invited to lunch somewhere else
FatherChristmas told me that as Thomas had been very good boy he was going to send him all the presents he wanted
oh
wishing you all a very happy and prosperous new year
love from Ruth
from Ruth
do you remember Ruth sent a parcel for you
we got a box of biscuits for Ruth
and we wrapped them up
and we didn't know when we were going to see her
well let's see
let's find something else for you to post
here's an envelope
so as Ruth was away at Christmas
and then we were going away so we thought the best thing was to leave a parcel
calm down Thomas
you've thrown it in the dustbin
so we ad bought Ruth a box of biscuits and wrapped them up
and then she sent you a nice fairy story book „ didn't she
an apple
the one about little red riding hood
is that what you're thinking of
you're looking at the Christmas tree now
and we've got some plastic apples on it
is that what you mean
an apple like yours
you're going to count them
that's right
what else can you see on the tree
the star at the top
well that's a heart shape „ isn't it
it's a heart shape
and there's lotsof star shapes
and there are little gold bows
that's the little soldier
little soldier boy
there's a bell
oh you can't hold it because it's on the tree

be careful because if you fall off you'll land in the middle of the tree
and it'll all go falling on the floor „ won't it
buy another
well yes
but we don't wanna buy another Christmas tree because you've fallen in the middle of it „ do we

who are the berries for
the birds

it's probably full of presents
and we've got these lovely apples

Daddy decorated the tree while Mummy was at work and I've not paid a lot of attention to it

well Granddad did it perhaps with Daddy and Grandma
I don't know
Mummy wasn't here

very shiny
would you like some more grapes
what do you say
good boy
I think bangadrumtime is back on Friday
Julian
Julian was poorly before Christmas „ wasn't he
and we missed the last one
that was a real shame „ wasn't it
it was a shame because the week before we did all sorts of Christmas songs „ didn't we
and you were just getting to learn them
and then he was off sick
so had we taken that last class you would have been able to sing them all again
and you would have remembered them
Christmas eve
I think we oughta make a list actually Thomas
of all the presents you were given „ don't you
because we're going to hafta make a thank you
write thank you cards
yes
yes we can write one to FatherChristmas
because he did bring you an awful lot of things „ didn't he
it was nice of him to do that
because he had lotsof little boys and girls to visit that night „ didn't he
he still made time to come and see you „ didn't he
hello
I don't think he said helloq to you
because you were fast asleep in your cot
and what did he do
he brought a present
did he jump the bed
or put the presents in the bed
oh we had the most wonderful time „ didn't we Thomas
I can't remember now what we did on Christmas eve
but I remember we had
you had a nice bath
and while we were in the bath we heard that music playing
the sleigh bells
and you said FatherChristmas is very near
we thought he must be somewhere near Ben and Charlotte's house
so you quickly finished your bath
had a drink of milk „ didn't you
and you got into Mummy's bed for a cuddle
and we chatted
and then you went to sleep
because you've got to go to sleep very quickly
because he only visits little boys and girls who've been good
and who are asleep when he comes
and you went to sleep
and then Mummy magically carried you back into you cot
and in the morning when you woke up he ad filled that stocking at the end of the bed that we ad left
and he left some parcels
but you ad actually had said to him when we said where would
when FatherChristmas asked where you'd like your presents leaving you said in the rocking chair „ didn't you
so he filled the stocking in your bedroom
and he left that red parcel that had TinkyWinky in it
and you opened all those
and then when you came downstairs there were lots more presents under the tree
and a lot in the rocking chair
and what had happened to the sherry
and the mince pie and carrot
pardon
yeah
you ate the crumbs „ didn't you
left from the mince pie
but he ad obviously been because we hadta move the fireguard „ didn't we
for FatherChristmas to get down the chimney
and he put it back not quite in the right place
and the mince pie had gone
and the sherry had gone
and the carrot
for Ruldolph
FatherChristmas coming
and you saw him the night before „ didn't you
at Linda's house
or the night before that
it was the night before Christmas eve
he came down Streetname Drive „ didn't he
on that sleigh
with music
and he was sitting there
what did he say to you
you don't know
did he not say ho ho ho
and he asked if you ad been a good boy „ didn't he
and Daddy put you in his arms and he ran down the street
alongside FatherChristmas
and he was talking and waving
and one of his little helpers gave you some chocolate
he was just checking where you lived so that the night after he would know where to come
I think when we were at Grandma's house actually on boxing day Mummy started to make a list of the presents that you ad got
I'm not sure what we've done with it now
where's an AuntieMable present
Nana's present
what do you mean Nana's present
oh NanaBealby's
the tablecloth
yes
we bought NanaBealby a present „ didn't we
oh no we can't open it
it's a present for Grandma
yes
I think it's on the stairs
it's waiting to go to York „ isn't it
well shall we make a note of all the things that FatherChristmas bought you
oh excuse you
what do you say
the scales

which is really nice because you can play the tape on your tape recorder
I don't think Mummy realized that at the time
oh he put you a little orange
do you remember that little orange he left in your stocking
and you clutched it all day „ didn't you
oh it had one pip it in
yes
NanaBealby as not got pips

I think you thought
oh and some music tapes
and I think you that that's what he brought

and then you came downstairs and when you saw all those other presents he ad left you
your little face
were you excited
all excited
you posting things

you'd like to get down
well let's have a wash first
