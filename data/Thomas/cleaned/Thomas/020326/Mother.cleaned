and had lunch
that's right
juice with a straw
are you wearing Mummy's shoes
you've put Mummy's shoes on your feet
they a bit dirty on the bottom
they're a bit hard to walk in those shoes
so after lunch you were running around the park
do you remember the man with a big truck
that arrived with the lawnmowers on it
and they started cutting the grass in the park „ didn't they
that's right
I said you mustn't touch the truck

too busy drinking to answer my questions „ aren't you
oh what's that
what can you hear
the ice cream bus
when you say that it sounds at first like you're saying oh dear mess
but I heard the tune so I know what you're saying
the ice cream bus

it plays a tune „ doesn't it
and the tune's called Teddy bear's picnic
here you are
there's some cheese on toast
and see if you'll just finish that little bit of pasta

yes
naughty
sorry Mummy hadta go outside then
because we heard the cats fighting
but Linda said it was Tiddles fighting with the ginger cat
it wasn't Purdie
oh don't shout
yes
I know that's what they do „ isn't it
that ginger cat's very naughty „ isn't it
it's a naughty boy
it keeps coming in the garden and upsetting Purdie
and it keeps going in Linda and Brian's garden and upsetting
they've got three cats „ haven't they
Molly Felix
and Tiddles
and it upsets all their cats
because it fights with them
Purdie's too old now „ isn't she
to have naughty boys coming in the garden upsetting her
there's enough on her plate with you
without a naughty ginger pussy cat as well
the alarm sounded very loud when Mummy opened the door „ didn't it
yes
shoes on
you wanna go back outside
well let's finish your tea first Thomas
are you going to eat the bread
yes
you can still hear the ice cream van „ can't we

ice cream bus
are you rolling the empty beaker across the table
it's a good job it is empty „ isn't it
are you eating fruit bread now
it as got currants and sultanas and raisins in it
I can still hear a pussy cat fighting Thomas
it might be Purdie
so I think Mummy had better just go outside now and look
Mummy will just go to the door
you carry on eating your tea
oh Purdie's crying here
Purdie what are you doing
what's the matter
what's Purdie doing
she's looking at Felix through the fence
and then they're crying at one another
but they're not fighting
I thought it was that naughty ginger cat and Purdie
but it isn't
Felix
Granddad asked you what the pussy cat was called
and you told him Felix
but Granddad thought you said Philip „ didn't he
and Granddad as been going round calling Linda's black and white cat Philip
and it's Felix
it's a funny name for a pussy cat isn't it
Philip
Purdie's just outside there

can you see her
oh it sounds like the ice cream
oh there's the ice cream van
look
yes
when he plays the tune it means that he as run out of ice cream and going home
is that the noise of the brakes
that's the noise that the bus makes when it stops
so do you think that's what
the ice cream man does
yes
he'll be round again tomorrow „ won't he
but if he comes back tomorrow and we hear him ring his bell
we'll know that he as sold out of ice cream again
and he's going home for his tea
oh bye bye ice cream man

poor Purdie
she as probably not recovered from when the door wedge fell on her head earlier on
oh are you alright
have you been meowing at Felix
we saw the ginger pussy cat in the garden „ didn't we
and we thought it was the ginger pussy cat that you were fighting with
oh Purdie
you're too old
too old for all this „ aren't you
poor old girl
shall I see if we've got a nice plate of food for her
there we are
there we are Purdie
Purdie's having her tea now
food
yes
she's eating meat
you don't really like meat „ do you
you like
you like sausage and bacon
and you very occasionally eat chicken
and fish
you don't want the apple
you don't want the apple
watch a Pippin on
oh you can watch Pippin later
no
and we're not watching
are you singing a little bit from BobTheBuilder
no
I think we'll finish our tea Thomas
and we'll go outside for a walk
while it's still nice
and then perhaps for ten minutes or so before bedtime you can watch some television if you like
before we get ready for bed
no
don't put it on the floor if you don't want it
leave it on the table please
the apple taste nice
is it crunchy
I can hear Purdie eating her food as well
she's crunching „ isn't she
she's not eating apple though
yes
Purdie wants to go back outside „ doesn't she
well she can't be too upset by the other cat
or she wouldn't go back out
it's like an obstacle course for Purdie now trying to get outside „ isn't it
she as got to avoid a pushchair and a sand pit
and we've put a swing and a slide in the garden
which never useta be there
a swing
yes
we've lived in this house exactly three years today
and when we moved in Thomas we didn't have you
and we didn't have the swing
and we didn't have the slide
or the sand pit
we've got all these things now because we've got you
you're Mummy's little treasure „ aren't you
Thomas
two Smarties
no
just because I say you're my treasure doesn't mean that I'm going to spoil you with Smarties
I'll give you a kiss instead
how's that
would you like a kiss
no
you'd prefer a Smartie
oh let me give you a kiss
oh just have a kiss instead of a Smartie
yes
a kiss is worth more than two Smarties Thomas
you going to kiss me
oh that was a lovely kiss
Thomas two Smarties
and then you say blue ones red ones and brown ones
there are three Smarties
not two Smarties
you're cheeky
you're cheeky
oh no
you looking at my feet and saying poohq
well they can't smell
because a few minutes ago when you were in the bowl of the water on the floor I washed my feet
you helped put soap on them
so you can't say that Mummy's feet are dirty
because they're not
I hope it's another nice day tomorrow Thomas
with the sun shining
a machine
what machine
a digging machine
and when we've eaten this we can go for a walk
and we can perhaps have a look at the machines
shall we go to the place where the theater useta be
that's right
because there are mixers and diggers and bulldozers
all sorts of things
cranes
