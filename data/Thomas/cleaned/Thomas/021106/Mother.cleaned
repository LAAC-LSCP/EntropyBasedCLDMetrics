you're looking at
that's right
I'll come and sit with you in a moment
Mummy as ordered a book for you this morning
well it was a book that I ad seen a long time ago about a little boy who liked plain colors
and his Mummy and Daddy who liked bright colored things
his Mum liked spots and his dad liked stripes
like frogs
and funnily enough I think the story was read on television a little while ago
boing
is that the noise a frog makes
why are you saying that
a sheep goes boing
a sheep
you're sitting on your chair now
who goes boing
a sheep
I see
it's a funny sort of sheep
well sheeps
yes
well sheep are normally white „ aren't they
but you can have black sheep
and you
and you can have some with both colors „ can't you
could I have the pencil please
alright
you hold it
well in this story
I don't know whether you can remember it Thomas
the little boy liked everything plain
he liked to wear the same colored tshirt and the same colored trousers and socks
and shoes
but his Mummy liked spots
and everything she had had spots and dots on it
she had summer dress with big spots
brightly colored
and hats with spots
and even her sunglass had spots
and I think it showed her lying in the garden on a deck chair
which was also spotty
and she was drinking from a beaker that had spots on it
and the Daddy loved stripes
everything he had had stripes on
and his Mummy and Daddy thought he was strange because he liked plain colors
and they thought he was strange because he just liked one color
now what's Mummy wearing today
a sleep suit
well it's a blouse
but it's green „ isn't it
just green
plain green

that's my hand
that's not green „ is it
and what color are Mummy's trousers

but what color's your jumper
white and blue and
green
you've got three colors in your jumper
your trousers are all one color
so they're plain
but your jumper has three colors
it as got a blue stripe
and a white stripe
and a green stripe
so which is patterned
this one
the stripy one's patterned
there's a pattern
and that one's patterned
you've got two patterned sleeves
but your trousers are plain „ aren't they
they're plain green
what else can we see looking round

AuntieMabel and Pippin went to ChesterZoo „ didn't they

was it a sheep
or a lamb
it was a lamb

we're not going to open her mouth
we'll just lift her lip up
can you see them
no
we're not going to force her because she might go
she might bite you
I love little pussy
her coat is so warm
and if I don't hurt her
she'll do me no harm
so I'll not pull her tail
nor drive her away
when I said not pull her tail you had the most mischievous look on your face ThomasHenry
and pussy and I very gently will
play
if Purdie died Mummy would be so sad

you put them on your
hands „ don't you
and you do that because it's cold outside
now Purdie hasn't got a coat like you
can you see this fur
beautiful fur we stroke
that's Purdie's coat
Purdie wears this whether it's hot on summer or cold in winter „ doesn't she
so do you know what happens in the winter
Purdie's coat gets thicker
so she feels warmer
and then this sort of time of year a lot of that extra fur falls off
which is why we brush her such a lot
so that her coats not so quite as warm
because in a few months it should be sunny and warm „ shouldn't it
and she'd be too hot with a lot of fur
you're a fireman and you're going to go and have you tea now

FiremanSam
if you're passing the shops could you please buy me some chicken for Purdie
and perhaps a tin of Whiskas
and she likes ham
and she likes a little bit of beef
and she likes cheese
and crunchy biscuits and milk
do you think you could buy all those things for her
I don't
I don't think Purdie's really going to eat strawberries and raspberries
is that for you
you and FireFighterMorris
PennyMorris
where as it gone
your helmet
have you lost your helmet
that'll never do „ will it
is it underneath your fire engine

can you see it just there
look
FiremanSam as got a telephone
a real telephone or a red one
a red one
oh it's just the phone that you're holding at the moment is a black one
I thought you said red
has FiremanSam on the television program got a red telephone
oh that should match his fire engine nicely „ won't it
oh dear
let's have a little look
oh that's just the case where we useta put a battery in when it worked
that's funny because you've seen Mummy change the battery on the microphone today
and I hadta slide the cover off „ didn't I
to put the battery in
and now you can see where the battery for the mobile phone useta go
doesn't work anymore „ does it
and why did you get this mobile phone
who gave it to you
and why did Daddy give it to you
because you ad been good to Purdie
that's right
because you kept wanting a mobile phone „ didn't you
and Daddy got a new one
and so he thought well seeing as Thomas as been a really good boy to Purdie
he as been nice and kind and gentle
we'll give him my old one
there we are sweetheart
I think I ad better go and feed this pussy cat
because you've been to the shops now „ haven't you
and bought all that food
there you go puss
pardon
who's coming
oh Dimitra and the dustbin men
oh I see
that's because I've just turned the microphones and the tape recorder back on
so
well I think you always associate the tapes with Dimitra „ don't you
and very often we
we nearly always try and do the recording on a Monday
you like train set
and railways
why're you putting on that silly voice
you're going to the corner shop
now what did Daddy tell you about saying that
who's going in the corner shop
Judy
who's Judy

the milkman brings all those things or you can find them at the dairy counter at the supermarket
and then there's the baker's
what do we buy at the baker's
sausages
no
you're thinking of the butcher's
the butcher's is for sausages and meat and bacon
and chicken
and ham
and slugs and cheeky worms
I don't think Mike would be very pleased if you told him that he sold slugs and cheeky worms in his shop
he'd probably just say you're the cheeky worm
no
