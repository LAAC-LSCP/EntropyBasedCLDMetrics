does that sound like it driving off now
is it
oh it's driven off
right
Mummy shouted you before cause when I looked out of the window I just saw some flashing lights
it was orange flashing lights
so I knew it wasn't a policeman
and then I saw this red car being lifted on the back of a trailer
but by the time I saw this and shouted you it had more or less gone up „ hadn't it
did you just see the end of it
pardon
oh no
no
I just would've liked you to have seen a bit more
it looked like Sylvia's car
she has a red car like that
she lives over there „ doesn't she
it might not have been
why
I can't think of anybody else with a red car „ can you
who's that
MrsBattersby
no
hers is blue
anyway they don't live over there „ do they
they live behind us
right Thomas
I'm going to have some toast this morning
what would you like
would you like cereal first then toast
what sort of cereal
cornflakes
you want your toast first
do you want toast first
or you have your cereal first
right
okay then
you sit down
which cereal would you like
cornflakes
alright then
would you like milk with those
right
come on
no standing around
sit down
good boy
are you going to pour them
who are you phoning

are you ringing your little mobile phone from your workshop to phone the police to arrest me
why am I
wait why are you arresting me
why are you arresting me
cause I scratch my arm
I know
okay Tom
I shall hafta put another top on
I know
I know
I shall hafta go and have one of Mummy's
chocolates
well
they're not vitamins
they stop Mummy sneezing and itching „ don't they
that's a different
right
is that enough
put the lid on
that's right
would you like some milk
yes
I thought you said yes please before
no way
they're a bit dry without milk Thomas
are they not a little bit dry without milk
we seem to be quite short of spoons
I wonder if they've been put in the wrong place
oh no
there they are
those spoons that are much larger than a teaspoon but smaller than a dessert spoon
they're ideal for cereal „ aren't they
cereal
I couldn't find them but they've been put in the compartment with the dessert spoons
I will start doing some toast for myself and then
by the time the toaster's free we'll probably have eaten
sorry
Ryvita
you're not having Ryvita
no
I said by the time I've done my toast you will have eaten
meaning you will have eaten your cornflakes
and then you will be able to have your toast
there you are
nice drink of blackcurrant
just check the lid's on properly on that beaker cause it didn't feel
can you get it out
a drop
I know
it didn't feel right when I put it on
must be some air in it
right
have a little sip please
still a drop
right
I'll put it in a different beaker
it does it every now and again „ doesn't it
oh dear
I don't know how to turn it
the trouble is trying to get the lid off
because the whole point of the lid is that it forms a really tight seal when it's on
I don't understand it Tom
oh I'm having to fight with it to get it off
that's it
that's it as well
gosh
I've hurt my arm
nearly about a police car
ooh
new lid
that seems better
just have a go with that
yes
lot better
you have nice shiny beakers „ don't you
for breakfast but you still prefer one with a lid „ don't you
cause sometimes we get it knocked over
right
watch while I'm putting my toast in the toaster for my breakfast
what timer's nearly run out
oh
cold plate
yes
are you sure you don't want some milk on them Thomas
yes
you've nearly eaten cornflakes before I've got time to do my toast
never mind
don't rush
we can take turns
as I'm eating a slice of toast
I can put one in for you
then when you're eating the one I've cooked
I can do myself another one
why
in the conservatory
well no
we're in the dining room having our breakfast
well we've nearly finished it off though
why
well
when we've had our breakfast
we've got to tape for an hour
haven't we
and so far we've only been doing it for about five minutes
I'm quite sure that by the time we've finished our breakfast they'll be some more taping to do
I'm just going to move these clean clothes because they needta be ironed
I suppose if you wanna finish off in the conservatory we can
is it because your train track's set up in there
that's what you wanna do
it's a good place for a train track actually „ isn't it
at least while I'm sitting here I can keep an eye on those orange lights
I'll just finish up
more cereal
oh yes
looks like a breakdown truck if it flashes

suppose it is on warning
and that breakdown truck flashes to warn us

mhm
that's the same as this „ isn't it
when this flashes it means something's causing a problem
we usually know what it is „ don't we
would you like marmalade on your toast Thomas

right
I'll put another piece in
I was just doing something through there
shouldn't of walked out like that „ should I
I have
yes
yeah
we've got to get a lot yet though „ haven't we
we just hope nothing eats them cause you know
ohgosh
that was the toaster
that really frightened me
I thought I'd been shot
you know NanaBilbey grows lotsof apples
well a lot of them fall
because she's got so many
a lot of them fall off the tree
no
well she's got a lot of trees „ hasn't she
and then when they fall down
often little slugs and things eat them
we get a lot of slugs
I just hope that doesn't
pardon
pardon
Thomas
now look
eat over there
pardon
Sainsburys
where
oh yes
I don't know whether it says Sainsburysq
but it's a blue tshirt
with an orange logo on it
it's not ours
it's on somebody else's washing line „ isn't it
no
we have a lot of slugs but the thing is I think the difference is that so many fall down at Nana's
a lot fall down between her picking them up
I don't think anybody would necessarily climb up to the tree
wasps might like apples but I think
yeah
there are wasps around at the moment „ aren't they
what the apples are big
yeah
well
I've sometimes seen wasps on
you know apples that have gone very ripe and are a bit soggy outside
well
wasps often have a nice little feast on that
buzzz
and what did man do on the telly
sometimes the big ones hafta fall off to let the little ones grow
yes
where
possibly
well no
I'm not
AnnieApple
I don't look like an apple „ do I
oh
which part of me
my bottom

fair enough

think it's shaped like an apple
not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing
is it nice having a Mummy with an apple shaped bottom

mhm
you can have apple puree every time I sit down Thomas
we could have apple puree every time I sit down
you know apple puree is all mushed up apple
everytime I sit down I squash my bottom it'd be like apple puree
then my legs might drop off
then my legs might drop off
if I've got a soggy bottom
my legs wouldn't be able to hold on to anything
yes
who has
Gwen
oh now Thomas
don't say that
yes
well
it's not nice to make comments about people's shape
or size
no
but it's not nice Thomas
because I don't it doesn't matter who you are
there's usually something about you you'd like to change if you could
you know
the color of your hair
the shape of your nose
your size
and you can't
it's just the way we are
we're all different
and some people are bigger than others
and it's not kind when you start making comments cause a lot of people can't help the way they look
I mean I'd like to look a lot slimmer
I wish my hair wasn't as grey
I wish lotsof things
but no
that's the way we are

ooh
there you are
you see
just make do with what you've got
well you don't hafta make do
you've got to make the most of it
it's like that lady said to me in Marks and Spencers the other day
when I was buying something
I said to her that it made me realize how big I'd got cause a lot of the tshirts and things that they were selling looked
they would look really nice on somebody like Thomas
you know
somebody tall and slim
somebody tall
sit up properly
tall and slim and young
and I said to her it makes me realize how I've changed
because I just wouldn't be able to fit into things like that any more
and she said all you do Madam is buy it in a bigger size and wear it with confidence
there you are
and she was more or less saying it doesn't matter
as long as you feel good in it you don't care what other people think
and it's true
when you look around you see all sorts of different people
but you know at the end of the day Thomas
we're very lucky that we can see
that we can hear
that we're not poorly
that we can run around
I mean look at the way you run around
and ride your bike and things and some children can't walk
some children are in hospital cause they're poorly
some are starving with no food
I mean yes
you know
you might want a few things but when you think about it you're loved
you've got a nice roof over your head
you're warm and snug at night and you've got plenty to eat
and when you're poorly we've got medicine and that really is all that matters
and you've got friends
no
that's right
you see they probably get to the stage where they don't even ask
because they just know there's no food
you imagine that
you know when you feel a little bit peckish and your tummy starts to rumbling
you imagine going for days and days and days without food and without water
or when you do drink water
sometimes it can make you poorly cause it's not clean
I mean I know there are a lot of children have more toys than you Thomas
they have a bigger house than you
they maybe go on big holidays and things which we don't do but
at the end of the day
the most important things in life are what you've got
and a lot of children don't have any of those
a lot of children have fancy cars and big houses
and lotsof toys but their mum and dads don't love them
nobody could love people more than you
I didn't say that right
nobody could be loved more than you is what I mean
Mummy couldn't love anybody more than she loves you
and that's very important
I know I get cross with you
but at the end of the day you're my precious little boy
and I'd do anything for you
you know that „ don't you

oh dear
what made you think of a donkey when I went through all that

not only you but Purdie is a lucky cat
most cats are not pampered like Purdie is
pampered means spoilt to death Thomas
I'm sure it doesn't quite mean spoilt to death
but she is
not many cats live to be nineteen
and she's got there because she's absolutely spoilt to death
isn't she
because Mummy loves her as well
well
shouting down her ear is not nice
but she can't really hear a lot „ can she now
but see even though she can't hear she still knows we love her
because we still feed her and we cuddle her and stroke her and brush her
and she's got a nice clean bed and we let her go in the sun
and we let her in and out when she wants
and Purdie's got everything
that's right
yes
and a lot of pussycats don't have food
and they hafta go outside and catch mice
and birds and anything that's hanging around
mind you
in fairness Purdie was a stray cat when we got her
she didn't have a nice life
when I got her she was very injured
very poorly
she was badly injured
she was hungry
she was covered in fleas
she was a real mess
I think she was frightened
cause she was frightened to death of the noise of water
and she was frightened of ladies
she didn't mind men but she didn't like ladies
didn't like me
ooh no
well you weren't there
don't know
she didn't seem to like anybody and look at her now
all these years later
and that's because we've given her love
haven't we
kindness
kindness
we've cared for her
shown her kindness
piece of toast
there you are
have you finished your cereal
dessert
it's a piece of toast with orange marmalade on it
well it's not carrot
it's finely shredded orange peel „ isn't it
right
it looks like a
oh there's no margarine on that darling
did you want margarine on it
because I don't have margarine on my toast
I just put marmalade on it
but because I was talking to you I didn't eat it up
and you pinched it
I think the other thing is Thomas
you never really know what happens
no
don't you do that
you don't actually know what happens to people
which is why you should always be very kind to people
because sometimes even though people put on a brave face
maybe at nursery or even at school
or on the bus
or in the street
do you see people and they're nice and chatty or very cheerful
but sometimes
do you remember that lady in Marks and Spencers who spoke to us yesterday
when we were having a meal
and she came up to me and Daddy and said
ooh you are lucky to have a baby
I mean she was an elderly lady and she said
I I could never have children
and I don't think they'd give me one now when I'm seventy
and do you know
she chatted to us and perhaps we're the only people that she spoke to all day
and she's obviously very sad sometimes
but she was nice and pleasant when we met her
and this is it
you never actually know what a lot of people
who's that monkey
oh yes
that's the box we brought back from Marks and Spencers
you know sometimes you never know what people
what's happening to people at home
you know
they might not be very happy when they get home sometimes
so you always try and be nice to people
because even if people haven't got a lot of toys
or sometimes at home people don't love them
or sometimes they're a little bit hungry or cold
you can always be pleasant to people and nice to them „ can't you
yes
that doesn't cost anything to be nice to people „ does it
right
I've just got to go and flip the button on the machine through here
there we are
now here's our friend

hello pussycat
and you see Purdie's so spoilt Thomas
that even though she's got some food left from last night
she won't eat it
cause she's a snobby pussycat
she likes
she likes fresh
but what we do
we trick her a little bit
cause this food from last night is perfectly alright
if it's dried up
which happens sometimes if it's a very hot day
I wouldn't give it to her
but this hasn't dried
so what I do is scrape it onto a fresh plate
mix it with a little bit of fresh
and she's none the wiser
she is sometimes though
she realizes sometimes and that's when we hafta put in the crunchy biscuits
did you have a nice time outside Puss
did you have a nice time
did you have a nice time
oh she's not going to talk to us Tom today
oops a daisy
there you are
there you are
you see
she's not noticed
that's clever „ isn't it
that's a clever trick

well it's too expensive
oops
it's one puss that just fell over
that's too expensive to throw away
I mean it's only a little bit but you can't waste food like that
are you likely to want more toast Thomas after that
likely no

right
well
this is my first piece
so I'll put another piece in for myself
but if you'd like it
you can have it
now just while we're talking about things like that Thomas
I know there are times when I get cross
and when I shout and when you think I'm being mean
but you know just think on
that we all have days when things don't go quite right
or we can't have what we want
but at the end of the day we've still got an awful lot more things than a lot of people
haven't we
oops a daisy
what would you like
if you could have anything in the world
what would you like

next to a what factory
Thomas don't be silly
that's rude
I don't think they have trump factorys Thomas

do you
I tell you what
it would be a bit whiffy
you know when you see big chimneys coming out of factories
just imagine what would be coming out of the top of that
not smoke but smells
mhm
no
I wouldn't like that
mhm
no
I can't imagine an important visitor wanting to go to a trump factory
oh Purdie's having a little sneeze
have you noticed she does this after she's eaten now
licking her big whiskers
you know why cats have whiskers Thomas „ don't you
well they can feel with them
they're very sensitive
and whiskers are as wide as Purdie's body
and what it means if she was going through a hole
if she was going into something
and her whiskers touched the edges
she would think uhoh
I'm going to get stuck
cause if my whiskers won't go through my fat bits won't go through
come on Puss
now I'm bringing it down for you
off you go
bye bye
bye Puss

and they have them on the top of the head for the height as well „ don't they
for the same reason
and do you know what GrandadBilbey did when he was a little boy
this was very very cruel
he cut his pussycat's whiskers off
and that was cruel
that was dangerous
but his pussycat could then of gone and got stuck in a hole cause it would have no idea
I'm sure they'd grow back again but
no
he was told it was lucky to find a cat's whisker
if ever I find one of Purdie's on the floor
I pick it up and I keep it
give me good luck
oh no
no
no
cause it's like the hair in our head
when it drops out it's
you know
it drops out and a new one grows
can you manage to finish that piece of toast
you're going where
what do you mean out of the pub
alright
rinse your hands in that water but it might be very very hot Tom
be careful
just dabble your fingers in
quick
quick
that's it
is that alright
oh
it is hot
yes
I haven't put any cold in yet
okay
are you going to go an play with your train track
I'll join you in a minute when I've finished my meal
what on
well we'll just open it a bit wider
then you can get through
sorry
what did you say
you wanna play with the train track
that's an
you can play with the train track and I was just going to have a little look at this road block game
oh that's alright
I could be doing that while I'm talking to you
it looks like it could be a good game this
yes
yes
oh I think it's good
oh right
hoo
I tell you what
it's fairly warm today Thomas
what's happening
right
you've made that a bike run „ have you
right
I suppose I clip these in here
does it matter where you put them „ do you think
right
it says assemble the road blocks as shown
right
lets have a look at the different road blocks
that's always a good help
oh there's a marble
that's quiet in there
I don't think a marble's part of it „ do you
but I suppose really you can put them anywhere
like
right
just till you've used them all up
right
do you think so
that's a funny noise
is sounds like a big car „ doesn't it
you do
yes
hello
how are you
yes
well
it's come out of its box
but it isn't really

okay
shit
we some to have so many interruptions Thomas „ don't we
well that's the trouble
when Daddy's at home
and doing tapes
we hafta do a lot of tapes about breakfast time
and then we hafta carry on when you come home from school
then of course Daddy's home
and it's a bit hard trying to get the house when it's quiet
and we've got
and the washing machine on as well which doesn't help „ does it
right
so what are you being Thomas
I'm busy being a road builder
here
look
I'm building lotsof roadblocks
Tom
oh
you're visitting me „ are you
what are you doing with my lunch in your carriage
oh I see
like a nice sandwich service
that sounds wonderful
I had the most gorgeous sandwich on Sunday
well you probably wouldn't like it but it was a nice crusty roll
nice crusty bread roll
which looked absolutely huge when the waiter brought it to me
and inside it had a layer of Brie which is nice cheese
and some salad
and a cranberry topping
like a cranberry dressing
no
it's lovely
you like cranberries
you like cranberry sauce
that sort of thing
had it with a glass of wine
it was just a little sandwich snack but it was gorgeous
and then I ruined it all because I came home and had a cup of coffee
and that half packet of chocolate biscuits

so I didn't have a very healthy day on Sunday
because the cheese was quite fattening
I'm sure
however
it was so
and that's what it's all about „ isn't it
are you
is that because I have such a big lunch
aren't they
why aren't they coupled properly
is there a problem
do you think your train's a little bit big Thomas
yes
well
why don't you make two smaller trains
or have the express as one train
or make the other carriages into another train
yes


right
I would imagine it would be the slow train that would deliver my sandwiches
cause I don't think the Intercity would be able to stop to make deliveries like that
does it
the Intercity express train to bring my lunch quickly
do they
I think you quite like building these little road blocks Thomas
it is
would you like to just try building one
it's not hard
you hafta get a little gate with a pointy bit like that
and another little gate with a hole
and put them together like that
right
there you are
I'll give you another piece
you try building that and then put it in
hang on
because it needs to go there
you match the holes
that's right
look at that
I'll build another one
see how you do with that one
you've played this with Daddy „ haven't you
well Daddy built it „ didn't he
this kit looks like good fun
I think you'd like this
it isn't rubbish
a bit of patience
you made one
well you make the next one and I'll slot it in the top
no
oh
you've broken the trains up a little bit now
that looks better
think we might manage the bridges better on this one than trains „ don't you
alright
well
that one could be silent „ couldn't it
that little train
broken
what's happened to it
oh dear
yes
that's right
when the big train's coming they make a lot of noise „ don't they
I don't know though
they're possibly quieter the bigger trains with lotsof puff Thomas
okay
booboo
is the engine shed where they sleep Thomas
or is it where repairs are carried out as well
repairs
so is that where
oh bless you
is that where that little train'll end up
going into the engine shed for repairs
very good
right
right
do I hafta come on board to get my sandwich from the buffet car or will somebody bring it out to me
it is „ is it
right
okay
hello
could I collect a sandwich please
ordered for Mummy
that's right
how much do I owe you
one p
oh
I love shopping with you
everything is so reasonably priced
isn't it

very generous
is it
oh right
what am I having for pudding
wait and see
there's a dog barking
don't recognize the bark
sounds like a big dog „ doesn't it
a big jelly for my pudding
wow
you like jelly „ don't you
you like jelly
jumping jelly
eaten it
yes
hm
now we're going to do it with three little bits
they've sent lotsof spare things „ haven't they
this is good
cause I would imagine

right
trains go on the road
well that's a bit strange
are they
I see
do you remember when we went somewhere and we saw a little road
in fact we've seen it more than once
a little road going
at the side of the railway that had its own traffic lights
it was only a tiny road „ wasn't it
I wonder if something's happened there and maybe one day they got hit by a train or something
cause it seems strange how a set of traffic lights for such a tiny road
do you think something must've happened
yes
look how have I got to wait for a train in the first place
I've got to the buffet car
do you think it would've been simpler if I'd just bought a loaf of bread and made my own sandwiches at home
it seems quite complicated
ah
right
so what happens
I come out of the office at lunch time
and I just walk across the road to the platform
and when the train pulls in
I nip on the train to the buffet car
get my sandwich
nip off
run back to work
work for the afternoon and then I come back to the railway station
and wait for a tram
you don't hafta have railway stations for trams though „ do you
that's right
goodness me
I must spend all my working day traveling round
yes
I'm on the tram
oh
we've got a bus involved now as well „ have we
it is „ isn't it
yes
do you want a little go at this with me
oh dear
do you want a go at this with me
shall I show you what to do
what do you do
no
it doesn't go in there
if you press the hat
press the policeman's hat
where his hand lands
look
it says
roadblock
well we can't have a roadblock cause we've haven't taken any away yet
right
it says take a roadblock off
so we each have a car
well
no
wait a minute
I no
just be patient please
right
which car are you going to be
which car are you going to be
right
well
you needta park the blue car on this which is start and finish
I'll be the one
over there
right
now you wait a minute
well
that says start and finish
but that's for if we've got four players
but we haven't
we've only got me and you
two players
right
you start
now spin the hand
that's it
just once Thomas
press it and let go
right
now it's now we can't do that
add a roadblock
no
we can't add anything at the moment cause we haven't got anything
just press again
that says add a block
this one says take a roadblock off and move your car three paces
now you can't go across the board so take a block off Thomas
right
that's right
now we'll keep it safe cause we might need it again
now move your car three squares
one
two
you can't go across
you've got to go up or down or sideways
right
there
one
two
three
right
now it's Mummy's turn to policeman

it says add a roadblock
right
so I've got to put the roadblock back on there
think that might block you
and I think the person that manages to get across to the other side without being arrested or
it says each person collects a car and places it on the start sign
well
we've done that
each player then takes it in turns to spin the policeman
the player with the highest number starts
oh
I see
right
we didn't do that properly
each player takes a turn to spin the policeman then moves the number of squares
as indicated by his hand
so you've got to go in the direction of the policeman's hand
cars can only move forwards
backwards or sideways
they cannot travel diagonally
the player then adds or removes a roadblock as indicated by the policeman's other hand
or clear their own
but beware of which roadblock you take away
you could be blocked again at the next turn
and the first player to drive from start to finish is the winner
right
yeah
probably
alright
well you do it again
it must it

right
we hafta move the number of squares as indicated by his hand
then it says the player then hasta remove a roadblock as indicated by the policeman's other hand
right
so actually it's this hand that must be the pointer for the the spinning thing
this is the one that tells you this is the way to move the roadblocks
right
no
you don't cheat
you press his hat right
now he's telling me to move four
what's he saying
knock a roadblock off
and move three places
I've got to move in this direction
is that right
okay
right
one
two
three
well
at least we've had a go with this
cause you've played it with Daddy before
so I've forgotten how well you work
I've got a bit excited that I've managed to build this
so there's a taxi or a bus involved a minute ago
a bus I think
why was the bus involved
what does the bus do
oh
I thought you said I was at the bus station
oh right
cause I was just thinking
this is adding to the number of pieces of transport I'm boarding
trams and trains
cars and buses
taxis
do I get an aeroplane to work
what about cycling
and can I walk
well I hafta walk from the office over to the platform of the train station
don't I
or get a pony and trap
ride a horse
skateboards
hot air balloon
motorbike
ambulance
police car
fire engine
hop
three legged race
in a sack
right
oh
got a big
oh it's outside
I thought it was an insect
think it's outside
well it looked like it was flying in the window
well flying at the window
but it is outside
not inside
you can't think of
a helicopter
parachute
what
what
something ideally
something ideally
a tram
ooh
you've already mentioned trams and trains and taxis and buses
oh dear
I think I'm going to have a bad journey home
looks like there's some roadblocks
well
I can't say roadblocks on a train track but it looks like something's blocking the train track
what
yes
a taxi station
do you know what a place is called where taxis gather
a taxi rank
that's right
it's where taxis line up waiting to take people
you know if we ring for a taxi
it comes and picks us up in the house
and sometimes if we're in town
we might go hoyq
and hail a taxi
taxi for hire
but if I wanted a taxi from say Piccadilly train station
we'd come out of the train station
see all the taxis lined up „ wouldn't you
and you'd get in the first available one
and all the taxis move in a row down the line „ don't they
customer announcement
go into taxi station
does the train actually drop people off at the taxi rank
that's very helpful
I'm off now
yes
oh guess what
I haven't paid for my tea
oh
I see
I thought perhaps I'd hafta get back on the train to go back to the buffet car

how do I get to the shops
just got off the train
and the one I got off has driven away
oh why
did I suddenly remember I didn't have anything for tea and nip back on
and what's happened on the line
what's happened to the train track
a broken point
what's the point of that
oh dear
that would be a broken point if I went straight off the end
some of the trains in the ThomasTheTankEngine book go straight off the end „ don't they
when they're being silly
which was the train Thomas
that thought it would ignore the danger sign
carried on and ended up falling down a big hole
was that ThomasTheTankEngine
I can't remember which engine
he kept seeing a sign that said danger no going beyond this point
and he just thought pfff
that's silly
I can do that
and he ended up going beyond the danger sign and going down a big hole „ didn't he
and what did the fat controller say to him
the fat controller was very cross and said well you can just stay there
we've other things to do
and they left him there till night time „ didn't they
and then what happened at night
when they hadta lift him out with a big crane
what did they need
because it was night time
they hadta come with other big things
other trains
to provide light so that the crane could see what it was lifting up
so ThomasTheTankEngine caused a lot of problems that day
and somebody else hadta pull his train „ didn't they
cause he'd ended up in the hole
right
the manage this one alright because we're about to go up and over the bridge „ aren't we
aren't we
why not
but we've not crashed „ have we
into the pond
oh dear
a little ThomasTheTankEngine
that's nice
he's lovely ThomasTheTankEngine but it's unfortunate that he doesn't run on the rails „ does he
but Thomas
I've just thought of something
you know the little newsagents in Didsbury
well we bought that there „ didn't we
but have they still got the ThomasTheTankEngine things
I know they've got a lot of BobTheBuilder toys there
they've got the Thomas ones as well as BobTheBuilder „ have they
you wanna play in there
why don't you just finish for a few moments love
it's still there in the bath
am I waiting for another train to get this one out of the hole
is Daddy back
with his newspaper
he'll see you eating again „ won't he
no
Thomas it doesn't matter
it's an apple
come on
we don't ever mind you eating fruit
come on
I'm only being silly
it doesn't matter
has he come in the door or have you just seen him walk past the window
in the door „ is he
I wonder why it's taking him a long time to come through
oh here he is
he's got a Tesco carrier
I didn't think he'd been to Tesco „ did you
I thought he'd just been to the newsagents
guess what he's bought
a sandwich

that's quite funny
after all the palava I've been to on the train
could've just said to Daddy
ooh run out and get me a sandwich
so you mean I've taken several tram rides and train rides and taxi rides
and I've ended up in a hole
and all the time Daddy had bought a sandwich from Tesco's
what was in the sandwich
did you see
peas and onion
no
did you not see
you mean cheese and onion
cheese and onion not peas and onion
did you not see what sort of sandwich Daddy brought back for me
one that Nana usually has
pardon
a slug one
that's right
wanna go through there now
watch your fingers
but I hadta go ahead and do the washing cause Daddy's desperate for a bag
which has been in the boot of his car and it needs a jolly good clean
and we needta get it dry so he can take it with him
so I hadta wash it now
now
pardon
are you getting builders on the train
right
I wanted you to do a little job for me
well
we've got a big pot of pebbles here
that you brought back
from Nana Lastname's house
and I wanna take some into work to use as paperweights
so will you just choose a few for me
I know the ones that I want really
I must have that one
but could you choose some for me please
one for Dot
right
well shall we take a few out first and see what we've got
cause I can't take them all in
oh
cause it's dotty
cause that's dotty
cause that's dotty
and that's dotty
thank you
right
well
I can't take them all
don't bag too much
just put a few out
the ones at the bottom are the ones that we didn't get this time
we've had these at the house for quite a long time
we play with them a lot „ don't we
lets see what we've got
yes
is it
yes
oh my gosh
oh yes
oh no
not on the bridge again
I like these Thomas
but I think we'll keep some of these here
for us to play with
can I choose the ones that I think will do the job best
