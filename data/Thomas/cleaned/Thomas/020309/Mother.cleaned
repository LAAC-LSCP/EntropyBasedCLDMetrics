it might be a little while yet Thomas
before the

oh there's Brian
Brian's doing what I was
adding a bit more to the pile

so that when the truck comes it only hasta stop once
rather than at everybody's house
that's the noise it makes „ isn't it
yes
truck
I think it could be a while coming yet Thomas
we'll hear it when it comes
do you wanna come back and sit and drink some milk
before the truck comes

this is the highlight of your day when the refuse lorry comes „ isn't it
round and round
what goes round and round
the wheels on the truck
big truck coming
that's right
why don't you come and just finish this milk Thomas
because you can hear the big truck when it comes „ can't you

TinkyWinky
Po
Dipsy and Lala „ hasn't it
and what else have you got on the bag
oh
it's a little spade „ isn't it
is it a spade
oh I think it's a trowel
I think it's called a trowel
and we have four plant pots
each showing pictures of flowers
and each the same color as the Teletubbies
that's right
you've stacked them up nicely „ haven't you
the blue one is the biggest „ isn't it
like TinkyWinky
but Po's the smallest and in this case it's the yellow pot that is the small one not the Po one
oh you clanking one of the plant pots on Mummy's tea
stop it
Thomas
your head is going to be terrible today
will you stop banging your head
I don't think you like it when it's too warm Thomas
on a warm day we lose that beautiful little boy
look it as come with some flower seeds
flower seeds
a little packet of seeds
and it tells us what to do
but it's a little bit soon to do it now
it says March to May
so we needta wait until the spring
and then look
there are
one two
three four little stickers
to put in each plant pot
do you not wanna drink your milk
so each plant pot has a sticker
this one says Teletubbies
that one has a picture of all the Teletubbies
that one has a picture of three flowers
and what's that
a Bow
it's a bunny rabbit
what's your bunny rabbit called
Molly
is it a Molly
she's there
she's on top of Dobbin and BowWow
there
oh is Molly coming for a look
does the bunny and rabbit look like Molly
yes
so what we've got to do another time is put some soil in each of these pots
and sprinkle some seeds „ haven't we
were you squeaking the man
do you like the little green bag it came in
no
the big truck's not here yet „ is it
well the men have probably gone round the corner to start stacking up some bin bags from other people
are you having some more milk Sweetheart
now you're holding Mummy's hair now
that's a sign that you're very tired
well if you can just keep going a little bit longer Sweetheart
keep going a bit longer then we nip round to see Jo and Becky
you can go round on your bicycle if you like
and we'll only be there about five or ten minutes
and then we can come back and have some tea
and if you're still tired then how about a bath a drink and bed
what do you think to that
juice and bed
do you want a big splash first
Thomas
well you're very quiet „ aren't you
are you putting Mummy's hair in your ear
no reach
well you can reach because you're tipping my head back „ aren't you
I think you've had a busy day and the heat's a little bit too much for you
you like playing outside but I think you've just got a bit too tired
there we are
so how many things have we got if we got
and four plant pots
shall we build a flower tower
look
a flower tower
all pots with flowers on
and there's a trowel
so when it gets to the spring we can use the trowel to put some soil into each pot
and sprinkle some seeds from the packet
and then do we needta water them with the watering can
yes
yes
you call the watering can the teapot „ don't you
yes
NinNin as drunk her tea

in the garden we've got a black bin which is the dustbin
where we put the rubbish
yes
there's a pussy cat asleep on the wall
and then we have a big dark green bin
which is the compost bin like this
and then we have a shiny green dustbin
which we keep your toys in
your outside toys like your wheelbarrow and lawnmower
and that's called water bucket Thomas
rain water comes down from the sky
runs off the roof into the drain pipe and into the water bucket
and then you turn the tap on and whoosh water comes out
that's the garden shed look
it says remove the pop up wheelbarrow
there's the wheelbarrow look
and turn the page to get the tools from the shed
look
oh yes
the inside of this shed is tied in a

we've got one of those but it's on the floor „ isn't it
and a beach ball
in the toy truck and some garden canes
look there's a spade
some shears
po snipsnips
some shears
a fork
a rake
and a lawn edger
and it says you will need all these tools for gardening
but be careful some are very sharp
where are the plant pots
and where are the plant pots on this page
now can you see the gardener's green wellies
where are they
that's a spade look
green wellies

then you can plant the seedlings
look
look at that
just on this side
use that to push that down
look

look at that
it says gently rake the soil
and then you can plant the seedlings
oh good work

let's put the rake back in the shed
there we are
that's the rake
the rake goes back there
now put the rack in there
now what else do we needta get
let's see what it says on the next page „ shall we

so shall we put them in the wheelbarrow
and then we can take them all back to the shed together
now that's better „ isn't it
so clear the weeds
rake the soil
oh
now it says take the trowel from the basket
to help you plant the seedlings
now look there's the basket
and there's the trowel inside
now this is a trowel
that was the trowel from your Teletubby set
and it says to help you plant the seedlings
handle it ever so gently
they're just baby plants
look
look at these Thomas
do you wanna take these and pop them in there

but you've put them on the lawn
and it goes whoosh
when Mummy was a little girl we had a sprinkler at home
in hot weather we useta turn it on and run through it
I don't think there useta be hosepipe bans then
now let's look at the back page
after all that work the lawn looks beautiful

it's like Molly the rabbit „ isn't it
oh look there's some more weeds there
oh isn't that lovely

now
yes but listen
the difference is that we've got proper tools to do it now
and it needs doing
when you're in the garden Thomas
you mustn't do that with the trees „ must you
no
you let Daddy or Granddad cut the trees
and now look at this
wow

now you can enjoy your very own garden
but don't forget to put back all the tools and recycle the cuttings
look there's a little door leading to
look at this path
stone path to the cottage
and all the flowers in the flower bed are growing beautifully
and the trees are well

and look
the ball's in the garden
do you remember seeing that ball in the shed earlier on
very gentle
teddy's on the swing
shall we sit him back on
there we are
look his legs bend
so he can sit on the swing
oh

did you enjoy that
no
we'll put that away for another day
but listen
when you're in the garden
when you're in the garden Poppet
you don't just start picking flowers do you
that's right
Daddy will smack your bum if he sees you doing anything to the trees
is that what he said to you
are we going to put all these back in the shed
yes
snipsnips
shall we put them back in the shed
the shears and the rake
do you wanna cut the trees
but you can't cut the trees outside „ can you
this is why we've bought this book
because in this magic garden
this is Thomas's very own special magic garden
so in this book you can water the flowers and pull out the weeds
and clip the trees and cut the grass
whereas outside you can take your wheelbarrow up and down the garden
and you can use your toy lawn mower on the garden „ can't you
but you can't start brushing the trees or doing anything like that
right
but you don't brush the trees outside here
just in this special garden
yes
would you like to pick up the trowel
please
there's the trowel
now we'll put it back in this shed with the fork
and what is that over there
is that the lawn edger
would you like to pick up the lawn edger
please
have you put it back in the shed
put the teddy on the swing
you're making an under your tshirt
oh Thomas
we've got to put things back in the shed
at the beginning of the book
don't forget to put things away in the shed
what's the matter

Thomas if you bang your head on that glass again
you made such a fuss when you fell at the toddler group and grazed your knee
and now you're smashing your head to death on the doors
I don't know
funny old world Thomas
shall we go out in the real garden now
do you think you're being good enough to do that
snipsnips
oh the snipsnips have gone back in the shed „ haven't they
these are snipsnips
yes
I don't think you'll be cutting the trees for a good few years yet Thomas
what's the matter

with me
do you wanna go to the door
to go out
alright calm down
