right
what are we playing now
theaters
what sort of theaters
sorry
like what love
MonsterInc theater
right
what's that

well I haven't seen it yet
no
oh
right
oh well I haven't so I don't understand
right
right
oh
yes
please
sounds like Rachel's outside with and „ doesn't it
I can hear them
I wonder what they're doing
they're playing ball
I wouldn't of thought so though
pardon
when
well I think if the ball went over our fence when wasn't looking it'd still be there „ wouldn't it
did you
right
it was all quiet a minute ago and as usual we started to come in here to do a tape
and suddenly we've got a lot of noise „ haven't we
but we've got to carry on because we've no other time
what are you doing
you've got paper on the floor and a pair of scissors
and you're cutting the paper up
oh are you
just be careful you don't cut either your fingers or your trousers
and what are we going to do with the tickets once you've made them
keep them
and what's this got to do with the theater Thomas
oh
yes
you do I see
so really you're making tickets so that when people wanna come to the theater we sell tickets to them
and then they take the ticket
and give tickets in „ do they
Thomas you know you said before you'd hurt your eye
there's a big bruise under your eye what did you do
what with a spoon
oh sorry love I thought you were just messing around because I'd made you eat your rice
there's a really big black mark under your eye have you seen it
have you what before the spoon incident
when was that
at school what were you doing
John whacked you
with a jumper
well I don't think someone hitting you with a jumper would do that
and the thing is
right
the thing is I saw you earlier on and we'd only just had our tea and that's when you started crying about your eye
and the mark's just appeared so I'd sooner think it's what you've done rather than John
oh
yes
it's a bit like a paper crown
oh
yeah
little peep holes in the
so
what
oh love what happened with Rose
you were telling me about Rose
your crown and her crown what happened
Ayisha took her crown off her
Icara or Ayisha
Ayisha
right
and then what happened
the new girl and then what happened
pardon
you gave her a big strip of paper
that's lovely
it was covered in
oh you made a necklace for her how did you make a necklace
aw
aw that was nice you made it for Mummy but when you saw Rose was upset you thought I must give it to her
well I'm pleased you did Thomas because although I would have loved a necklace from you if Rose was upset then she needed it more than me at the time „ didn't she
what was it like
what was it made of beads
or paper
paper and then did you hafta thread black then blue then pink
lotsof Barbies what do you mean lotsof pink
yes
you call pink Barbies „ don't you
aw poor little girl
mm
don't make too much of a mess Thomas because you've got to tidy it up I'm not tidying up
okay
yeah
why don't you try and cut once you've good scissor control why don't you try and cut along the lines
try and cut right along the lines because that's already marked into boxes you said each one of those lines is a ticket a you're cutting „ couldn't you
that's it just watch your trousers darling don't cut your trousers please
you like using scissors „ don't you
do you still like painting
you're quiet when you're concentrating „ aren't you
like when we made those buns you hardly spoke at all because you were so busy weighing and measuring
concentrating on what you're doing that's good really Thomas that you're concentrating
just see if you can chat to Mummy whilst you're doing it and tell Mummy what you're doing
pardon
you can't talk a single sound well that's very helpful
I thought we were having a conversation
what's that noise outside
no
it isn't a lawnmower
I don't know what it is it suddenly goes vroom

mm
very strange there are some appearing
they're obviously doing something outside because Rachel and Miles are outside and now sort of Sue and Roy's
do you think they're cutting a piece of wood
watch the scissors in your mouth in those please
so when you've cut up all these tickets what's the game we're going to play Thomas
no
you told me we're playing theaters
right
but are you at the ticket factory first

well that's a decent size piece of paper „ isn't it that's left so you could do some drawing on that
who else likes drawing and painting and doing things like that at school
Holly
oh well Holly's
Adam's girlfriend

well Holly's still your friend
and Adam's still your friend
you're a bit young really for having girlfriends „ aren't you
all the people that you play with are friends
they're your friends
yes
whose your girlfriend
Ayisha
you've just been telling me that Ayisha broke
don't put scissors near your face
you've just been telling me that Ayisha broke Rose's necklace sorry her crown and made her cry

and where's Ayisha from Thomas
I'll be surprised will I why
Glossop

I am quite surprised that if she comes from Glossop she goes to school with you
right
I see
I think you're getting confused with Molly from Glossop who's your little girlfriend
oh dear
no
I'm glad you like Ayisha I've AyishaAnisha
AnishaKumar and what's Ayisha's name Ayisha what
AyishaBisha I don't think so
what's this
I'd love to come to the MonstersInc show but I'd like to know Ayisha's surname first please
what other little girls are there in your class
alright then well I'll tell you what
if we're playing the theater game does this mean that everyone who comes to the theater hasta hand a ticket in
what
what
oh I see you snip it you punch it do you
well what I was think was we could pretend that everybody who takes a ticket is somebody from your class and you could call out their names
how about that
right
well
no
well
okay
we'll hafta do it between us
hello I'm Rose
right
what's Rose's name
Rose MacMillan
right
I'm Rose MacMillan
right
hello I'm Anisha Kumar
here's my ticket
oh you're a nice ticket man „ aren't you
thank you
hello I'm Thomas Lastname here's my ticket
I like MonstersInc
is MonstersInc is that the character that there's a big blue sort of bear kind of thing a bit like a gorilla
blue I love you
blue I need you oh that's
you're wearing them blue socks
I bet they're smelly socks now because it's near the end of the day
poo blue I smell you


thank you
hello
I've come to watch the performance
here's my ticket
you're a good snipper
you could actually do with a ticket punch „ couldn't you want me to go and get you a hole punch or do you prefer your own scissors
ticket punch alright I'll get it please don't make too much mess though
we could use that new dust pan and brush now „ couldn't we
oh
yeah
there's a hole punch for you
Daddy wanted to know
Daddy wanted to know if we were having fun here
we're having great fun „ aren't we
no
I'll show you what you do you put it in
right
you see these silver bits here
you needta just put in one of those don't get your finger in
no
no
not those silver bits
there
under there
press
punch
you've punched a hole
where have we been where people punch holes apart from the theater
train that's right because I think I explained to you „ didn't I
when it was either the train or the bus
don't tip those out
that's where all the bits when you've punched a hole in your paper like this to make a little peep through look I'm peeping
all the round little bits of paper that are punched out collect in the bottom of that

I tell you it whether it was on a train or bus recently you asked me why the ticket collector punches holes and can you remember what I told you
why he did it
can you remember Tom
well it's because if I buy a ticket to York just imagine how many times I could go to York on the same ticket
but once the ticket man has looked at it and punched it it means that I can never use that ticket again
and what happens when you go to York on the train and come back to Manchester you get one tricketq ticket that says
no
don't Tom
you get one ticket that says York to Manchester and another ticket that says Manchester to York
so we travel from Manchester to York the ticket collector punches a hole and it means I can never get on another train going from Manchester to York
cause he'll know he'd pick the ticket up and he'd say you've done this journey before naughty girl and put me in prison
no
he wouldn't put me in prison but if you try not to pay for a ticket on a train or a bus you can be in big trouble and you hafta pay a lot of money
much simpler to buy a ticket in the first place „ isn't it
right
so back at the theater who's coming into the theater
Missus Mann
yes
I'll be Missus Mann
right
Missus Thomas is coming
oh heck
tell you what if Missus Thomas is coming who's got to be good

right
do you ever dream Thomas
yes
what do you dream about
the of that cat oh I do remember that
yes
the animal rover
but can you remember any other dreams that were a bit nicer than that one
a big fire what in the same dream the one where the car ran over the cat
oh goodness me
so some dreams are nice and some dreams are not so nice
some dreams can be funny „ can't they
do you know what we call
what did you jump at
oh
no
would you really tell me if you forgot to put your trousers on that's terrible „ isn't it
oh dear
that's not a good dream do you know what we call bad dreams

pardon
rubbish
either sit on me properly or sit in that chair
sit in that chair
no
rubbish dreams they're called nightmares „ aren't they
I think you've had a nightmare oh you're a nightmare
yes

but can you remember a nightmare
I think you had a nightmare a while ago because you woke up really crying
do you not remember

Nanna's been run over oh dear you don't have very nice dreams if you keep dreaming about people being run over
right
now do you know what it says on this page
it says
come and bring your chair and sit next to me that's a good idea „ isn't it
that's a good boy
right
now I'll point to the words and tell you what the words say
you know that word anyway „ don't you
Biff
couldn't
sleep
Biff couldn't sleep she lay in bed for ages and ages
and now she went downstairs to find Mum and Dad
I can sleep she said
go and snuggle back in and try and think of something nice said Biff's Mum
or you could try counting sheep
I've done that said Biff and I still can't sleep
well I'll tell you a story said Biff's Dad
and he picked up a book that Biff had brought home from school
why did Chip sorry why did Biff come downstairs Thomas
she couldn't sleep
what did she want
she couldn't sleep did you think she wanted to sleep
do you do you think she just wanted a cuddle and be cheered up
can you remember when you couldn't sleep ever
well what do you do when you can't sleep
you walk
what do you think would happen if you came downstairs like Biff did at night
you'd say Mummy can I have a Crunchie and what do you think Mummy would say to that
oh and you're making a mess and do you know why I would say no
well think of why I would say no Thomas in the middle of the night to you having a Crunchie
why would I say no
pardon
you've walked on a piece of paper why would I say no to a Crunchie in the middle of the night
because you've brushed your teeth that's right
that's right
but if you came down upset what do you think I would do
no
I wouldn't give you a Crunchie
stop talking about sweets
do you think I would carry you back upstairs and give you a cuddle
think I would „ wouldn't I
Crunchie
right
I'm going on to page two now
and this says
what does that word say
Dad
do you not know Dad
told her a
a story Dad's
Dad told her a story ohgosh the book's called Dragon Stories oh goodness
alright so on page three the was a story about a
dragon
right
no
this is what I'm going to say to you now
the book was called The Dragon Stories
Dad told her a story from the book
the story was about a dragon
some of the stories in the book were about friendly dragons but but not this one the story was about a very unfriendly dragon
in fact it was a really terrible dragon with horrid scales and sharp claws eyes that glowed and a mouth that breathed fire
Biff's Dad told the story so well that Biff was quite scared
I don't like dragons said Biff
what sort of dragon was in the story that Dad told her then
a nice one but she was pretending it was horrible
do you think so or do you think it was just a horrible dragon all together
did Biff enjoy Dad's story
love come and sit down please
oh
right
do you think Dad enjoyed telling it
I do why can you tell that from the picture
a big smile on his face
and what's this face like
she's sad „ isn't she
was it a friendly cosy way for Dad to tell the story
yes
do you think so
well if she'd come downstairs a little bit upset
well precisely because apart from Dad reading a story about a scary dragon look he's in one chair and she's in another
I think if it was us I would have you in the same chair and give you a nice little cuddle „ wouldn't I
right
turn on to pages five and six
which say Biff dreamed about the dragon
oh I see do we think from that then that what must have happened originally is that Biff couldn't sleep so she came downstairs
her Daddy read her a story it was about a dragon and then do you think after the story she must have thought oh well I'll go back to bed
because look it's a picture of her in bed and it says look Biff dreamed about a
dragon
oh
well oh I see now when we do this I know what happened
well the story made Biff feel quite sleepy so Mummy took her back to bed and she fell asleep right away
but as soon as she was asleep Biff dreamed about the dragon
and it was the dragon in her Dad's story
somehow Biff knew the dragon was somehow going to get her
and that she would hafta fight it
I don't like dragons thought Biff
and this particular dragon looks very fierce
do you think so
right
why do you think Biff dreamt about the dragon
but why do you think she had a dream about a dragon
because I think oh that one will be so beautiful
do you think she dreamt about it because she'd just heard a story about it
oh well look in the dream that these little tiny dots mean either this is what she's think or this is what she's dreaming or feeling
ohgosh can you see in her dream
and whose chair is it whose chair has the dragon come from
Dad's and she's still sitting on the sofa
oh dear where did the dream come from
from what
mm you think the dream's coming from her brain
right
which pages have I turned to now number
six and seven
and this says it was a nasty
dragon
and she's still dreaming look „ isn't she
as the dragon came closer Biff could smell the smoke and feel the heat from the flames it puffed out from its great round nostrils
grey nostrils
that's right
its claws were long and sharp and its scales were leathery and green
it was a nasty dragon
that's what it says on page six it was a
nasty dragon
and Biff got herself ready to fight it
oh I don't think I'm much good at this thought Biff
this sword doesn't look as if it could stab a squashy tomato let alone a nasty old dragon with a tough leathery skin
the dragon was getting closer
oh help thought Biff I don't wanna fight this dragon
oh dear how has Biff's dream got worse Thomas
because on the other page the dragon was just sitting under Daddy's chair what's happened now to the dragon
he's come out of the chair and what's he doing
he thinks that's a nice snack
goodness me what's happening with his nose
snot it's not snot it „ is it
it begins with but it's not snot what is it
smoke

and what's Biff using to protect herself
a dust bin lid
and what else
a bucket on her head a metal bucket on her head
and it looks like her lego land sword in her hand „ doesn't it
ohgosh what do you think s going to happen next
she'll get her sword and whack it
do you think so mm
right
let's turn over now to pages
which page is
whoops
Thomas your chair
quick
oh goodness what pages are we on now
eight
eight and nine

very nasty dragon
oh dear
the dragon came right up to Biff she could see its horrid gleaming eyes
oh look its eyes are not nice „ are they
it was a very nasty dragon
urgh said Biff dragon
its eyes are yell
suddenly the dragon sprang towards Biff with a terrible roar
growl roar
it went
ohgosh
