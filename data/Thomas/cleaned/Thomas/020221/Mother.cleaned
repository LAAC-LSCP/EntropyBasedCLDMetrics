where's what gone Thomas
where's what gone
oh there's a light on the front „ isn't there
it's a bright light
it's a bright light
is the apple good Thomas
po
it's po
it's red
it's a stacking ring
Mummy's going to pour herself that cup of tea
pouring the tea from the pot into the cup
it's a mug „ isn't it
not a cup
meow
it's a picture of a pussycat on it „ isn't it
and while you finish your apple I'm going to ping some toast
baby nice
your nice
Daddy's nice
who else is nice
new chair
is the new chair nice
it's not really too new now „ is it
no
I think when you've finished your breakfast and we've washed your hands we'd better brush your hair as well
couldn't catch that Thomas
you were eating an apple
what did you say
all done
oh I think you've put too much in
no
eat it properly
showing off now „ aren't you
no
no kicking
big banging
no
Thomas
no
no kicking
Thomas
what did Grandad say to you last night
yes
because he didn't want you kicking „ did he
we went to a wedding a few weeks ago
and somebody had a video there and a camera
and you were smiling at the camera „ weren't you
smile
say cheese for the photograph
what were you doing
you were smiling „ weren't you
smile to the camera
that's it
so they should be interesting photographs when they come out
in the bathroom he has a Teletubby set which includes a waterwheel and spurting flowers
so when you put water in the flowers spurt out water and the wheel moves round
and there's a slide that the Teletubbies can slide down „ isn't there
and that's the handset
you know the big microphone from the Teletubby
it often pops up out of the floor on Teletubbies
well it's a big microphone and they talk into it „ don't they
but you like playing with that „ don't you
so we bring it down from the bathroom
a big bear
oh yes there's a big bear on Teletubbies „ isn't there
big bear
talk to Jo and Sue on the telephone
tell them what you're doing
so he often has conversations in the handset
and whoever he's talking to he always tells them that Daddy works in a chip shop
that's Daddy's coat
if you don't want it pop it back in the bowl please
oh you're giving it to Mummy to eat
oh Thomas
no
that's naughty
that's naughty throwing food
a bang
only naughty boys bang
is Thomas a good boy or a naughty boy
no
Thomas
that's not banging
that's kicking
and that's dropping and throwing
I think you're showing off „ aren't you
now stop it
would you like to finish this apple
right
okay
yes
well let's do something else
would you like shall we wash your face and hands
NinNin
mhm
ooh
pardon you
let's clear these things away
yes
shall we
yes
a bang a bang
Thomas started music lessons last Friday
you're quite into banging at the moment „ aren't you

Thomas
no
that's naughty
oops oh dear
no
there nearly wasn't anything on the table
a bang bang bang
look
this is your face
are we washing Thomas's face
I thought we'd have a look at some faces in a minute
yes I'm washing as well
let's wash my hands
right
absolutely
think you're talking about trucks
night night
are you going to sleep
shall we brush your hair
make you look a smart boy
the tap's dripping
annoying me
brush Thomas's hair
brush here
no no
this is Mummy's brush
this big brush

you don't wanna be smart
oh Thomas
you're being horrible
he does
look what Nana brought you yesterday
she made this from an old teatowel
a PaddingtonBear apron
thought you might like to put it on Thomas
now we're just „ aren't we
would you like to help Mummy do something now
this is icing sugar
icing sugar
are you mixing
just clear these things away
this is a sieve
let's pop a little bit of icing sugar through the sieve
no
Thomas
not in your hair
no no no no no
we've got to eat this
here we are
let's pop a bit of icing sugar through the sieve
actually I think we could have put it straight in the bowl but
we're sieving icing sugar
actually this isn't even a sieve
it's a teastrainer
silly Mummy
you've not seen sieving before though
so that's quite good
let's do some more
more
it's sugar
icing sugar
Grandad has sugar in his cups of coffee
but it's not this type of sugar „ is it
this is more
what does this remind you of Thomas
snow
does it look like snow
don't put your fingers in because you've got to eat this
I know you've just washed your fingers but it's still not nice „ is it
not nice
and luckily the clothes you're wearing now are just clothes that you had on when you got up
because I would imagine by the time we've done this before we go on our train ride we'll hafta change „ won't we
right
here you are
would you like to play with the sieve
and we'll pop a tiny drop of
now this is going to be very hot so
drop of hot water in there
that's right
water
we're mixing the water and sugar
look
we're mixing with the spoon
can you see it
give it a mix
you have a go at mixing
mix it up and make it nice pop goes the weasel
oh
I think we'll just pop a drop more sugar in that Thomas
because it's quite
little drop more
a drop more
you'd like to stir it
keep stirring it
keep the spoon
keep stirring
I think we're going to need some more water now
getting this right „ aren't we
no
you don't need the
no
no Thomas
no
the sieve isn't for mixing
the sieve

the sieve is for sieving the lumps out of the sugar
no poppet
no
just let Mummy finish mixing it
you can help mix
that's right
let's stir it
that looks almost right
and then we're going to spread some of this icing on some biscuits
and we've got some Smarties
and some ChocolateButtons
thought we could do some faces
should have made some red icing then we could have piped some lips on
before we do that shall we just look at a few faces in a book
I think that's fine Thomas
there we are
more drop
just wipe those little hands
where's Thomas's face
I think I've got icing on my nose
it's a tin with some biscuits in it
one two three four biscuits
four biscuits
oh

Thomas Lastname
wasn't quite what that was for
you've just finished your breakfast
in fact you haven't finished your breakfast
you didn't eat it „ did you
this is very hot water in this bowl
ooh
you don't wanna do this
you see what we're going to do with this Thomas
then you can put it on the next one
ah chocchoc
well that comes in a minute
look
spread this icing with a knife on the biscuit
can you see
mind the water because that's very hot
Smartie
is that what you're saying
a Smartie
now look at all these colors
look at the different colored Smarties
all done
it is all done
look Thomas
shall we put a pink Smartie there
it's a little face
blue Smartie pink Smartie
shall we do another one
I'll put some icing on this
and you can decorate the next one
how many pink Smarties have you got there
ah ah ah
ooh
thank you
we can put an orange
oops a daisy
you're just going to eat the Smarties „ aren't you
put them back in the container
put them back in the packet
it as run down the side
does this remind you of snow Thomas
no snow
right
icing's running down the side of that one
are you going to put some Smarties and Buttons on there
Thomas
do you wanna decorate
put some Smarties or Buttons on there
that's it
that's it
oh is that the postman
because the dog didn't bark next door you're barking instead of the dog
oh that's Alice
that's Alice
that's a little face
with ChocolateButtons and orange Smarties
yes
there you are
are you going to do something with that one
we've got some Buttons here
you've decorated the biscuits with two green Buttons
think there's enough icing to do another one „ isn't there
when we do this again Thomas
Mummy'll make some red icing and put it in a piping bag and you can pipe on some smily faces
because most things have faces „ don't they
can you see that little girl's face on the packet of Buttons
she's wearing a red dress „ isn't she
it's a little girl
now don't eat all those Smarties
you didn't finish your breakfast
put some on here
that's right
now when Daddy comes home you can show him what you've made
can't you
hm
there's some biscuit crumbs in this icing
I can't see a lot going on the biscuits
but look at that
that's fantastic
isn't that good
a good boy
Thomas
that one's to finish and that
what about putting some Buttons on it
excuse me
two
yes you put them on
two eyes
ooh
it's alright
what are you doing
one for your tummy and one for the biscuit
what about putting some Buttons on one
so what have all these faces got
two eyes and a nose
what about a mouth
they haven't got mouths „ have they
you've got some silver buttons upstairs but I think
not upstairs in the cupboard
but I think they're a little bit small for you
how about we do this
it's not really going to show up „ is it
no
smile
these faces are smiling look
smily faces
we could frown by doing it that way
oh that one's very sad
it's a very sad face
how about we put that there for a nose
put it on there
make a nose
or a
Thomas Lastname
are you going to use some Buttons
before they magic away
Smarties all done
shall we put a ChocolateButton there
we could make that the nose „ couldn't we
and two eyes
and what about two ears sticking up
well they've not really worked very well „ have they
some more Buttons
let's decorate those others
all done
it's empty
it is
I promise you
oh po baby
is she wearing a red bib that little girl on the packet
a po bib
now put some of these ChocolateButtons on there
no
don't take them off Thomas once we have done them because Daddy would like that
get a plate and when Daddy comes home he can have one with a cup of coffee „ can't he
I'm sure he'd like that
shall we put them on a plate for Daddy
that's a good boy
that's a nice one „ isn't it
one
two
three
three
six
one two three six
two
those ears didn't stay up very well „ did they
no
shall we put
oh no
leave them on the plate
because then Daddy can have one when he comes home
would you like to put some more Buttons on that one
well how about we put
that one's done
ooh
oh no licking fingers
which one would you like to eat
that one
right
shall we put the others away
well you can't have them all
there isn't room in that teeshirt for all those
now put them back on the plate now
and then we'll put them in the fridge
or the biscuit tin would be better „ wouldn't it
because if we put them in the fridge the biscuits will go soft
hat
green one
right
what are we going to do with these
how about we give two to Dimitra if she doesn't mind them being handled
what about Mummy
please may Mummy have one
oh more for Dimitra
right
put those over there
there you are
and would you like these two
we'll leave you the biscuit and that
what's that now
no they've gone now because Daddy's going to
we can show Daddy when he comes home „ can't we
shall we have a look at these books and look at some faces
books and faces
look
those are a little bit like the biscuits we've just made
two eyes and a smily mouth
a little girl and that's a little boy
she's smiling
he's smiling
two eyes a nose and a mouth
it's her clothes
look there's a teddybear here
are you looking at those
can you see the teddy
oh trust you to find that page
where are the Smarties
can you see some Smarties on that page
are they Smarties
no I don't think they are „ are they
yellow
it's a red page

I think he's referring to the icecream van
comes round every night and we call it the icecream bus
and one Sunday Daddy went out to buy an icecream from him „ didn't he
but when the icecream man rings his bell it's because there's no icecream
he as sold up and he's going home
oh yes
oh that looks like a cake
it as got chocolate on it „ hasn't it
yes Thomas
where as the man gone
you wanna give juice to the man
yes
a carriage
we call it a carriage or a truck
bang a bang a choochoo
did you just hit the train
oh no
yes
more juice

the door's shut „ isn't it
yes
I think he's telling you that he went with Grandad to go and see the ducks last night to feed them bread
you went to see the ducks „ didn't you
that's Lala „ isn't it
hello Daddy
Daddy might like some icecream
Daddy
so far this morning Thomas you've had breakfast Smarties ChocolateButtons a biscuit and icecream
you're going to pop „ aren't you
I wondered whether that was what he meant when he said Dadda chocchoc when Peter arrived home
I think he was probably trying to tell him then
poor Lala
oh
mind the wire sweetheart
is it bedtime
what do you do when you're asleep Thomas
you snore
