Pippin's on

Purdie's out rushing
oh can you see AuntieMabel and Pippin on the television
I think that's the episode about the jumper „ isn't it

you can see the children going down the slide „ can you
mhm
those Cornflakes are nice „ aren't they
would you like some juice

you're peeping at AuntieMabel
you're running away

you are funny
yes
very windy „ isn't it
this morning
mhm
the slide fell over when it was strong wind last time „ didn't it
can you hear a bee bah
you think it's an ambulance or a fire engine
somebody as been naughty
oh that will be the policeman if it's somebody being naughty
the policeman's cross
you can't see any fire engines or police cars or ambulances from here „ can we
we can hear it
yes

too far away

too far away to see it
would you like some more Cornflakes
have you enjoyed those
good
Mummy as eaten all her's as well

everybody eaten up
have we all eaten our Cornflakes
right
what I have done with them
oh here they are
I'm going to make some toast as well
then you might like a little orange
pardon

no
I don't
I don't think so Thomas
what we can do later on
is open the advent calendar
and there's a chocolate behind that
because it's the first of December today „ isn't it
we've gone from October and November
October and November into
into Sainsbury
into December
oh can you see some sheep on the television
are they being chased
no
sheep don't say moo
what do sheeps say
that's better
what says moo
cows say moo
cows say moo not sheep
are the sheep being rounded up the sheepdog
I can hear a buzzing noise
what do you think that is
a buzzy bee
I think it might have something to do with the central heating
we're having it sorted out tomorrow „ aren't we
it's making funny noises
what about the baa lamb darling
oh the baa lamb's having his haircut
yes
that's called shearing sheep Thomas
no baa
well Sue hasn't gone to work yet
she's late this morning „ isn't she
Mummy as got to go into work
Grandma and Granddad are coming to look after you „ aren't they
what do you think you'll be doing with them
you'll be doing what
peeping
peeping at PostmanPat's van
who will you be peeping with
Grandma and Granddad
do you think you'll be going up to JohnLewis
buying fire engines
oh
from JohnLewis
and who will you be buying fire engines for
for Thomas
riding them
oh I see
when you go to JohnLewis do you go to the toy department
and you have a ride in the fire engines and on the trucks
look Mummy
what are you pointing at
oh round and round
you're watching the wheel going round „ aren't you
do you know what it is Thomas
it's a spinning wheel
you saw the sheep having it's haircut
you saw all the fleece coming off the wool when they sheared the sheep
well somebody now has taken all that wool and they're combing it
I would imagine that's the factory where they make wool
you know how we brush Purdie with that special brush
and you see all the fur coming off her
well they comb the wool like that
and then that special wheel's called a spinning wheel
and the lady spins the wool
and it ends up like the wool on the balls of wool that you can see on the television now
and they dye it different colors
the man's holding some pink wool now „ isn't he
but I think AuntieMabel's in the middle of knitting a blue jumper for her sister Edith
because we've seen this before
and she as run out of wool and she ad gone to the shop
and the shop said they hadn't got any in
they suggest she go straight to the factory
so look can you see
she's going round with a little piece of blue wool that matches the jumper
and she's trying to match it up with some new balls of wool
do you think she'll find it
I bet Pippin does if she doesn't
is Pippin hiding
oh he's a tinker that Pippin „ isn't he
don't say that
he's a tinker
little tinker
we can't have jam on toast
because we have
oh you'd like cheese
because we haven't got any jam
is Pippin hiding
where's Pippin hiding
is he running round the factory
the wool factory
would you like some cheese on this toast Thomas
or some Marmite
no
it's not moo
it's baa
you can see a sheep
what are baby sheep called
they're called lambs
you enjoyed those Cornflakes „ didn't you
that's a a black sheep and a white sheep
no baa
baa
and what does Pippin say
what noise does Pippin make
woof
and what noise does Purdie make
I can hear another sound Thomas
can you
there you are
there you are
you've got half a slice of toast with cheese on
and half a slice with Marmite
you think it's a fireman now
he's driving a fire engine
what do you think he's going to do
put out a fire
and where do you think the fire is
where do you think the fire is Thomas
hosepipe
he's using his hosepipe „ is he
to put out the fire
sprinkling on lotsof water
I've got my hands in water at the moment
because I'm just doing a little bit of washing up
do you help Grandma wash up
does she let you stand on the stool and help her at the kitchen sink
you heard the fire engine and ladders
is the toast nice Thomas
is the toast nice
no
oh
oh is it storytime now
we had storytime yesterday at playgroup „ didn't we
and what happened
is that what Isabelle said
it is „ isn't it
she couldn't see „ could she
and then what happened
she screamed didn't she
Sonia fell down
no she didn't
Sonia took her out „ didn't she
it was storytime at playgroup
and Sonia was reading the story
and Isabelle wasn't very happy because Isabelle couldn't see the book
and Isabelle kept saying she couldn't see
and her Mummy kept moving the book hoping she could see
but she couldn't
and she got terribly upset „ didn't she
and in the end her Mummy hadta take her out
and she hadta stop reading the story and pass the storybook to somebody else
but I think this has happened before
and it was Isabelle's book Thomas
it was Isabelle's special book
and I don't think Isabelle liked sharing it with other people „ did she
I think she just felt that her Mummy should just read it too her
a teddy bear
a butterfly and a teddy bear
oh do you know what they're doing on the television now
they're making jelly
they're making jelly using jelly moulds
can you see how it's wobbly
it's wobbling on the plate „ isn't it
jelly does that
oh this is the storytime that we've seen before Thomas
because the book's called Don'tStickYourFingerInTheJellyNelly
I think that's why they're showing jelly
there's a little rhyme about jelly
jelly wobbling
it goes jelly on the plate
jelly on the plate
wibblewobble wibblewobble
jelly on the plate
you not really eating the toast
would you like some orange instead
some satsuma
oops a daisy
the fridge is too full
it won't close
that's better
does Thomas like eating jelly
yes
red jelly
oh Thomas
I don't know what I'm doing this morning
just put the marmalade back in the fridge and I haven't even used it
I've put butter on the toast
and put the marmalade away without spreading some on the bread
Daddy as gone to work early this morning „ hasn't he
so will you be riding in Granddad's car
where do you think you'll be going
to the airport
to watch some aeroplanes
you like doing that „ don't you
you're chewing apple and I'm eating toast
not yet
you don't want your toast
okay
what as happened
well I think they're still reading the book about don't stick your finger in the jelly Nellie
and I think it's a story book where you hafta keep putting your finger through the page to feel something
I can't really remember the book Thomas
it's a long time since I've
read it
are you happy with the orange going straight in the little pot that the apple as come out of
would you like another apple
Thomas
what do you say
no
no thanks
that's better
when Mummy spoke to her friend's little boy on the telephone yesterday
he's called Joseph
I asked him how he was and he said I'm doing fine thank you
that's a good thing to say „ isn't it
when somebody asks you how you are
and do you know what he was playing with
he said I'm playing with ThomasTheTankEngine
and he said I've got some other engines
oh sausages
oh that must be the song about the sausages sizzling in the pan
we can do that one „ can't we
three little sausages sizzling in the pan
all of a sudden one went
bang
and we know another one
same song but
three little sausages sizzling in the pan
one went pop and one went bang
that left two little sausages sizzling in the pan
one went
pop
and one went
oh that doesn't leave
oh that's Mummy's maths isn't very good
no
if there are three sausages and one went pop and one went bang that would only leave one sausage „ wouldn't it
you're eating this quicker than I can peel it
there you are
it's all gone now
one more left
you'd like another piece „ would you
one more segment
sausages gone
have they finished doing the sausages
oh I see
have they eaten them
I don't even think it's little sausages in the pan
I think it's five big sausages sizzling in the pan
or five fat sausages sizzling in the pan
bang and pop
yes
you wanna hold that one
don't eat it too quickly now Thomas
chew it properly please
beautiful and juicy these „ aren't they
nice and sweet
sweet and juicy
they'll be lovely now until after Christmas
and then after Christmas they start getting a little bit dry
and not quite so sweet
but then it's getting towards
bananas in pajamas
is that the other one they're doing now
but once these have gone out of season we start getting things like strawberries and
and sausages
and raspberries and cherries „ don't we
nice summer fruits
and we've always got apples and we've always got bananas
and we seem to always grapes quite cheaply now
bananas in pajamas
is that a song or a book Thomas
bananas in pajamas
a lady called Julia
yes
Julia was the presenter „ isn't she
on storytime
there we are
oops a daisy
I'm sorry
it's not dirty Thomas
it's the last piece of satsuma
it's because you've squeezed it
and it as gone squashy
the juice has come out
it's not dirty
juice squirted „ didn't it
so you didn't eat your toast but you're having a fig roll now

they're quite good for you
pieces have come off the fire engine
well you've bitten a little corner from the roll „ haven't you
no
eat it properly please Thomas
no
eat it properly please
Thomas
oh
there is a funny noise
it might
a digger
do you think it's the sound of a digger
it's going dig dig dig
I don't think it sounds like a train
or a we usually hear the trains from here
so I can't think what else would be blowing it's whistle
it sounds like a ship
it sounds like a ship's horn
but I don't think it'll be a ship's horn round here
unless they've put a ship on the pond
mhm
that's the nurse reversing her car
and we don't know her name „ do we
Georgia's Mummy
mhm
I'm enjoying this toast Thomas
