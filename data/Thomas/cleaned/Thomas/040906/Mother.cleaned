new air tank
what tank
air tanks
oh I see
right I don't think they'll fit in there sweetheart
I think it will break „ don't you
oh careful
don't
did you manage to mend that
did you manage to mend that
please
so what have you done today Thomas
you must remember some of it
you only remember what
reading
so you did some reading with MrsJohnson
and was that good
you're going to change the air tanks and the boiler
so you did some reading at
you did some reading with MrsJohnson
and did she say it was very good
did she
because she's written a nice little comment in your diary to say that you've done some good reading
and did you talk about ringing MrsWilson up last night
and what did she say about that
did she
right
is it
well what do the air tanks do Thomas
do you think so
right
yes
does it
that's right
and your Dad was dead
oh deary
that sounds a bit drastic
yes
where's the air tank
am I the delivery man
I can be yes
yes
oh very good
they look like those big gas cylinders
do you remember Thomas sometimes we see vans
they've got a cab like this
cab like
and they've got sort of open truck what's not covered up because it's not a flat trailer
it's got a little edge round it
and all the gas canisters stand up
do you remember
remember seeing those
I'm trying to think what sort of truck we've got that might have
no
no it's not a cab like that
and it's got a trailer
but the trailers got sort of a little ridge round it
a little sort of fence round it
you sniffing
have you got cold
just rushing round
so what have you been doing at Ben and Charlotte's house
I know but you can answer the question
what have you been doing at Ben and Charlotte's
play
what did you play
chase Charlotte
does what smell whiffy
oh I see
so you can get your air tanks in
oh it's very
quite whiffy
no it doesn't actually
is it a bit like a fresh air
just thinking we only go to Spain
yeah
did you
oh yes
actually you did
we saw a
you're quite right
I'd forgotten that
well we've seen them here as well but you're quite right
when we went to Spain
we saw one of those trailers delivering gas canisters „ didn't we
was it one of the cafes or restaurants or something
it was „ wasn't it
gosh I'd forgotten that because also there was a van delivering
do you remember CocaCola and bottled water
and the man gave you a bottle of water „ didn't he
do you remember that
now I was going to say do you remember in Spain where we had air conditioning
but I don't
oh excuse me
I'm tired now I've sat down
I don't think that was gas canisters like that though
because it was quite noisy in the room
do you remember this
we were trying to do a tape
well you probably didn't realize we were doing a tape
but it was too hot in the room without the air conditioning on but with the air conditioning on it was too noisy

oh
not only have you got gas canisters in there you've got little pints as well
pumps fresh air into the shop
yes
have a lot of pipes in that „ aren't there
but you still haven't told me what sort of shop it is Thomas
a Spar shop
but I thought it was selling boilers and gas canisters and
is it not
actually though when we go to Wales
the Spar shop there which is very near AuntieJack's house
that does sell gas canisters because
I think quite a lot of people who go there
are either camping or staying in caravans
and they use those gas canisters either to use barbecues or cookers in the caravans
so one Spar shop definitely does have them
I don't know
I tell you what the delivery lady's got dirty feet
oh look at these
not smelly feet but dirty feet
ah don't tickle
I was showing
what does MrsBlackford say
look without touching
look with your eyes
you look with your eyes but you don't touch

pardon
no you're not
oh no
no
Thomas stop it
ah
horrible child
no don't please don't do that again now or I shall get cross
it's only because I've just moved my foot but I can still
you're going to get hiccups now
oh you have already
right no please Thomas don't do that
let's play with this shop

no
oh no
let's play shop
you were about to say hello old lady „ weren't you
yes I know you were
did I tell you don't touch my feet
you don't no
you don't touch my feet and you don't call me an old lady
otherwise do you know what I might do
no I wouldn't tickle
but I'm just thinking I might say no more sweets ever again
or no ice cream
or I might say tonight
when you get up in the night you stay in your own bed
or Mummy doesn't come into your bed
and you wouldn't like any of those things „ would you
or we wouldn't get
no that's enough now
no that's
Thomas stop it please
what's happened to your face
you got a bump there
what's happened there
there's a red mark
no it isn't a scratch mark

why did she scratch you
no Thomas don't blame Charlotte for things that
you didn't even know you'd got it till I said so
were you playing outside at Ben and Charlotte's house
what did you play it
pardon
dig
hm
tigtig
oh like tagtag
tigtag
is that sort of a chase game
tictac
oh we're back to sweets again
always get things back to sweets
Thomas your feet smell
will you put up
ugh
what earth have you been treading on

that's disgusting
ugh Thomas that is absolutely disgusting
I've never smelt your feet before
ugh
I was just sitting here
that's that terrible smell
what have you been treading in
it smells like you've been treading in vinegar
your socks actually smell of vinegar
don't they
what have you been treading in
don't be naughty
they're absolutely foul
shouldn't really smell
I thought it was sweaty feet
when I smelt your socks they just smell of vinegar
ugh
well I like vinegar but I don't like you smelling of vinegar

I tell you what we could do with some of that air that you're selling in the canisters
don't do that
it smells a bit better
no smell better if breathe your feet
phew
smelly
pardon
what wasp
oh it's not a wasp it's a fly
it's a fly
it can't see it's dead Thomas
I just needta pick it up
it's not a wasp
stop it
stop it now
well what's the delivery man bringing when he comes
well perhaps he's coming in a minute
you have a drink and then your hiccups might stop
what
what do you mean you swallowed it backwards
oh you're trying to get rid of your hiccups „ are you
oh no
it takes a bit longer than that
actually a teaspoon full of vinegar is a good thing to get rid of hiccups
but I don't wanna give you hiccups
and I don't wanna give you vinegar
oh don't be silly
oh you nutcase
no Thomas don't
don't
oh you're such a sillybilly at times
oh dear
right I think you'd better get towards your shop because the delivery man is coming now
are you
doesn't look all that nice outside actually „ does it
I think it is going to rain
grass
you don't know though

it might just blow over
hello
how are you
your smell
well I was just thinking how very full of fresh air the car park smells
that doesn't sound right „ does it
how nice the fresh air is in the car park
oh but I'm only in the car park
I bet when you get in that shop it'll smell all stale and horrible and smell like sweaty socks and vinegar
why
well let's get inside then
let's go in the shop
walky
in the shop
oh what a nice smell
mm
oh this smells fresh
what is it about your shop
why does your shop smell so nice
this boiler
what does the boiler do
and then what do you do
so then you just look through there and check it's alright and everything's okay
I see
so
is this just to make your shop smell nice
or do you actually sell this to customers this air fresh kit
you don't sell it
because it
oh right
I see
because it's ever so nice
I was just thinking perhaps you know it would be nice to have one at home
and then when Daddy comes home with sweaty socks
or when my little boy Thomas comes home with vinegar socks we could
spray it
oh and what about Purdie
in the summer when Purdie gets hot
where
oh look at her
silly old Purds
ah that's sweet
are you going to let her in
well
when she gets hot in the summer I bet she's got four sweaty feet
has she been there a long time
did she just appear
do you wanna let her in
she is cute „ isn't she
she's lovely
I can't tell what you're saying
she's looking to see if what
so do you think she's come from the ceiling „ do you
is that why she appeared so quickly at the door
she's just come down from

don't let her in because I wanna just take this knot out
let me see
we useta have a brush in this drawer
let's just see

tsk
she's got a bit of fur all matted up
no she doesn't like anybody touching her tail or
brushing her tail
oh she cried a bit then when I hurt her
I'm not meaning to hurt her though
oh she's got such a knot
I can't believe she's not cross with me
no don't shout
don't shout at her
oh listen
what's that
what sort of siren do you think that
why do you think the police car's coming
oh dear
well I'm on emergency business
I'm sorting a knot out of pussy cat's tail
what she got in that bit
oh Purdie
ugh
honestly
what a family

she's come back with a mucky tail
actually it's not mucky it's just she's got in a knot „ hasn't she
isn't she a lovely girl
isn't she
yes she is
she's showing her claws
can you see her claws
that claw
look at those long nails

to the doctors
MrCoombs
the vet
I think she's probably getting ready to attack me
shh don't fright

oh that's it
pardon
no
oh what do you mean time to let her out
well she can go in a minute
the sooner
as soon as we've got this little knot out of her tail
don't open the door yet Thomas because she'll go through
I don't want her going through
why are you talking in such a silly voice
what's that on my head
a carton of orange juice
why have I got
and what is it
why have I got a carton of orange juice on my head
oh thank you
do you Whiskas for Purdie in your shop
oh she's sneezing now
did you hear that
I think I'll be sneezing in a minute
although actually I had a you know one of those tablets Mummy takes to stop her sneezing
so with any luck I'll be alright
we can nearly let her through
just just let me feel if there's anything else
hasn't she been a good girl
that's right
you go with Thomas
that's right
you going to come back now Thomas
please
that's a good boy

just let me put this fur in the bin and wash my hands Thomas because I don't know what it was on her tail

do you mean the cylinder Thomas
a sceno
what does a sceno mean
oh does it
a sceno
hm that's a new one
yes love
yes
whiffs
oh dear
well when you say whiff do you mean a nasty smell or a nice smell
a
well to me a whiff is poh what a whiff
it means it's a bit ugh whiffy
not very nice
a bit smelly
it's a bit whiffy
a bit whiffy yes
I think you
right
what do you call it
a masceno
hm
where did you get the word masceno from
a new
a word you've learnt or a word you've made up
oh made up
I must say I didn't know
no it's a made up name
I'm surprised you still remember it
I have
and is that what makes the shop smell nice and fresh
mhm
yes
do you know something Thomas
when we first moved into this house
sometimes in the evening
when we were
oh Purdie wants to go out again look
I'll tell you this story in a minute
oh Thomas you've got a huge clump of fur on your trouser leg sweetheart
inside
that must have been when I was brushing it before I picked it up
it's alright if she wants to go she can go
don't shout at her
just leave her
come away Thomas
if she wants to go she'll go
it's alright you can leave the door
no she wants to stay just now Thomas
the story is when we first bought this house
no leave that there
we useta come in the evenings
oh you're sitting on my knee for a story „ are you
right once upon a time
there was a Mummy and a Daddy and the Mummy was called ninnin
and the Daddy was called Peter
the hairy Peter
furry Peter
yes that's right
big hairy Daddy
and we useta come in the evenings after work
because we were cleaning the house and decorating and doing all sorts of things
and sometimes because it was in the summer when we bought the house
we useta get out of the car
oh there would be the most gorgeous smell
it was really nice
and I never knew what it was
and somebody said oh you're quite near the the Mcvities factory because we live in HeatonMersey and the Mcvities factory is in HeatonChapel
you know where the Mcvities factory is
do you remember
at Christmas you saw the lights
they had a little grotto outside the biscuit factory „ didn't they
do you remember
and they said that's where the biscuits are made
Purdie would like to come through Thomas
the gap's not big enough for her
thank you
and I said to Daddy how exciting living close enough to smell biscuits being cooked at the factory
and do you know
from then on we've never ever smelt it
we've lived here all these years now and never smelt biscuits cooking
and then
oh
Purdie's sneezing
guess what
I brushed Purdie and I'm not sneezing and she's been near me and she's going
oh guess what doorman
someone wants to go out again
but
continue with the story in a minute
it's called keeping
do you know what she wants
where am I sitting
in Purdie's chair
oh dear
oh dear
yes if you like
she won't wanna go near socks
oh now what's she doing
no don't no
no
she wants
she's going to come „ isn't she
oh well while she's making her mind up I'll continue this story
now at Christmas time
we were in a car with
AuntieJoyce and Chrissie
and we were coming off the motorway back into Stockport
and there were some very strange smells
and Chrissie said oh it's the sewage works on one side and it's a curry factory on the other
and AuntieChrissie said there were lotsof complaints from people if they're driving toward Stockport about the smell
so instead of Mummy thinking she's going to smell nice biscuits being cooked
then apparently Stockport's renowned for smelling of curry and sewage
that's not nice „ is it
so to me Thomas
she what's she doing
no she's not eating
what's she doing with her nose
she's sniffing
she's smelling
I don't know what she
she probably thinks oh it smells like my bed's usually there
and it is but you've moved it
so to me
if I came into Stockport
no well no we don't hafta pretend we're that „ do we
you could have pretended you were making some nice curry or some biscuits
to me if I came
you making biscuits at the factory
what is
chocolate
chocolate digestives
wow
that sounds nice
actually the make TUC biscuits and JaffaCakes at that factory
I always thought it was digestives but it's not apparently
so
oh a hundred and one
thank you
what are these biscuits or Dalmatians
biscuits
so
to me if I smelt sewage
I would think phew what a whiff
not nice whiffy
if I smelt biscuits cooking or if I smelt curry being made I would think oh what a gorgeous smell
if I smell you when you've just been in the bath with nice soap and then talcum powder
although we don't put talc on you now
but when you were a baby oh what a gorgeous smell
and when washing's just been washed and drying outside oh what a gorgeous smell
but when your shoes are dirty and smell ugh what a whiff
don't touch please
no don't touch it Thomas because the pollen will stain
yellow pollen
can you see where the pollen's
it stains if it falls
so that was the story about the whiff and the nice smell
pardon
I thought shop and delivering things
fresh air
somebody's at the door
oh it's Daddy come home from work
what do you mean you told me
we're still playing Dad
it's alright
Daddy coming home doesn't stop us playing „ does it
mind you having said that I wanna have my tea in a few minutes
don't be so upset
oh Daddy got an upset boy here
because I stop playing with me I think
I think
I think he thinks I'm going to stop playing with him is what I mean

well I haven't cooked it Tom
let's have a little break
you wanna kiss me
alright
okay
the fresh air shop
I've gone
bye bye
what are you filling the shop up with
food
what sort of food
lotsof things
pardon
pardon
I can't tell what you're saying
oh digestives
digestive biscuit
oh I like digestive biscuits
do you
what other sort of biscuits do you like
little baby fingers
what are they
chocolate fingers
ah yes
of course

did you like cheese biscuits as well
little cheddars
what you do
you're closing up
why
are you tired after unpacking all your deliveries
I bet they're quite heavy to carry those canisters as well „ aren't they
course they are
right so your shop is shut
you're having a little siesta or is it night time and you're going to bed
little break
I bet you're having a cup of tea or coffee and a digestive
aren't you
what are you having
cornflakes
peas
a first class stamp
a second class stamp
I can't see what that is
juice
what was the one before juice
know what you're playing with
it's the bar code thing for the shop „ isn't it
and as you twizzle it round it's showing the bar code
the price for certain things such as juice and milk
and peas
because at first when you said you were having a break and you were having some Cornflakes I thought
well you must have been up very early to deliver the papers and the milk
and then I thought perhaps you were having breakfast
but then when you started saying you were going to have peas
doesn't sound like breakfast to me
what time of day is it at your shop
pardon
night
your what
your plaster
plaster
plaster as in ouch I've cut my finger
can I have a plaster
come on
right do you know what it looks like to me
it looks like an oxygen tank for a fireman

it's
carries oxygen
oh of course
oxygen yes
for your fresh air shop
have you got something stuck
oh that's right
that's the sweet dispenser
what does that dispense
well don't
nothing
do you sell air fresheners in your shop
either spray ones or ones that you know
that's an air freshener there Thomas
you see that little white pot there
that's an air freshener
don't ever play with this but
just let me put it near you
smell it don't get too close
does that smell nice
no you
what was that
Molly
on the
oh look who's here
oh dear
look at her face
gosh she certainly saw her „ didn't she
no in your bedroom Thomas I tell you what you've got
it's white plastic box and it's got the same sort of lid „ hasn't it
but it's called
I've forgotten
I've forgotten what it's called
forgotten
it's not a humidifier it's a dehumidifier
and
is there
where
no
because your bedroom's very small sometimes
the windows steam
well it doesn't happen now so much since we've had the double glazing but before we had double glazing
often we useta get up in the morning and your window useta be really wet inside
you know all steamed up
and so we put that plastic box on your radiator and it's got special ingredients inside that look a little bit like cat litter but it's not cat litter
and it actually absorbs moisture from the room
and we put it on the window ledge because that's where the water seemed to be
but since we've had double glazing that problem seems to have disappeared but the dehumidifier is still on your window ledge
and actually you can get them where they're air fresheners as well because the sort of cat litter stuff that you put inside
and it's not cat litter
but it can smell nice
so I think that's what you're thinking of „ isn't it
we've got one in the bathroom as well „ haven't we
yes I've got one from here
whoops and I've just shaken it up
that's it
whoops
I shook it up
stops it to fall out
there we are

from your socks
from your shop or your socks
would I like an air freshener for your socks
yes I certainly would
when you go to bed tonight I'm going to put your clothes in the washing machine
you can have a nice bath
a nice scrubby dubby
could I have red one please
no
but I don't think I'd manage to carry a big one home „ do you
I know but I thought the delivery man had gone home
on his truck
well how has he got home
he you mean he jumped in a truck very much like his own but it wasn't his own
what do you mean
oh dear
but did his keys fit and everything
of course they did
jumping in
I think I'm in
yes please
well yes please
don't give me too many though cause I've nowhere to store them when I get home
in the cupboard
which cupboard
in the air freshener cupboard
so I have to find
well you might have an air freshener cupboard but you were in a shop that sells lotsof air fresheners
I haven't got very much space at home
oh right
and the pipe goes on all of them
and then what happens
does it
it smells gorgeous
hm
that's a new one gorgeous
Purdie's gorgeous
pardon
what's what darling
you don't needta pay for the air fresheners
why not
because
goodness me
I wish this was real money
I really wish this was real money
well you've given me a lot more than a hundred and one pounds
you've given me
oh I don't think I can manage that
look
do you
those are early learning centre fifty pound notes
two of those is a hundred pounds and if you find a pound coin
that's
that's a pound coin
well done
there you are
that's a hundred and one pounds
I don't think I can manage sixty hundred though
but to be honest to go into the Spar shop and spend a hundred and one pounds on air fresheners is really quite expensive
I don't usually carry that much money when I go into the Spar shops
I'm walking home
I'm just going to set this tape actually
that's the other thing I'm going to do
oh yes
oh I might
has he
there we are
oh no
tsk forgotten the milk
I've just seen the cat at the door
and what does she like to drink
now what have I forgotten to buy
Smarties cat food biscuits
why do I need Smarties
oh I thought it was because you wanted Smarties
oh I'll hafta go back to the Spar shop
I wonder if Purdie would come for a walk
are you coming for a walk Puss
oh I bet it's not open this Spar shop when I get there
hello
oh I'm glad you're still open
oh I won't be very long
I know exactly what I want
I don't needta walk round the shop
I'd like four things
I'd like some Smarties
Smarties from the top shelf
that's right
are they on the top shelf because pinch them when you go into the shop
yes
thank you Smarties
some milk please
oh yes some biscuits as well please

oh you saw a shopping list
very good
so you'd know the other thing that was on the shopping list then
cat food please
oh
I can hear the ice cream van
do you hear it
oh wonderful
thank you
so I've got four things
how much is that please
oh a two pound coin
that's a very swish coin „ isn't it
very nice
oh are you giving me lotsof money as well
some sneeze medicine for Purdie
is she sneezing a lot
is she
do you have any sneeze medicine
what's sneeze medicine made from
take all of those in one day
and that will make her sneeze go away „ will it
right and
right okay so she has one at teatime
one in the evening
and one at bedtime when she sneezes
what if she doesn't sneeze at bedtime
okay well hopefully if she's had one at teatime and one in the evening she won't be sneeze at bedtime „ will she
now what about in the morning
it seems an awful lot to have one at teatime one in the evening and another one at bedtime if she needs it and nothing in between
what about breakfast and dinnertime
right so really every time I hear her sneeze I give her a tablet
okay
oh I see
if she sneezes at breakfast time
she takes them all at once and then she doesn't have any left for the rest of the day
right one at breakfast
and if she sneezes again another one at dinnertime
and if she sneezes at dinner one at teatime
and if she sneezes again one at bedtime
and if she doesn't sneeze again I know it's worked „ don't I
so how much do I owe you for the sneeze medicine
five p or five pounds
five p
oh that's jolly good
huh it's a bit cheaper then the NHS this „ isn't it
five p for a prescription that's jolly
I wish Purdie's vets bills were only five p

do you know it's very expensive Thomas taking Purdie to the vet
very expensive
but because we love her and we want her to stay well we pay it „ don't we
you found something else that my boy might want
my boy Thomas
I think the oven's just gone peep
that must mean tea's about ready
oh an air freshener
you don't think it's because we keep spraying all these air fresheners around that it's making Purdie sneeze „ do you
do you think she's had too much fresh air
not to let her eat till Christmas
but it's quite a long time till Christmas
so I just keep giving her tablets
I don't let her eat again
pardon
only till Christmas
fair enough
okay
so can I have a lift home please with all these things

but you're going to give me a lift home
right this is a

right very good
now do I hafta get all this in myself or are you going to help me unpack the shopping
you're that kind you might
you're very kind

you forgot to shut the shop
oh I hope people haven't gone in and stolen all your air fresheners
