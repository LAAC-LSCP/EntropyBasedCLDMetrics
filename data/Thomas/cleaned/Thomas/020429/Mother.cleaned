and I thought you

yes
you've got a sore knee and it looks like a petal from a flower „ doesn't it
it looks like a red petal on your knee
and last night when Mummy was putting the cream on your face you were talking about not being able to see Norman because it was dark
that's quite alright
did you say thank you and thanks
yes
it's an empty plastic pot that had some Smarties in it Grandma and Grandad gave you „ isn't it
would you like some cornflakes Thomas
no
no thanks
I bet you do if I bring them to you

but you're eating such an awful lot of fruit at the moment that your tummy's getting a little bit upset „ isn't it
tummy ache
pardon
what darling
caterpillar ache
oh I know what you're talking about
caterpillar ache
you're talking about our book the very hungry caterpillar „ aren't you
when he was a tiny caterpillar and he ate and ate and suddenly he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore
he was a great big caterpillar
and when he was a great big caterpillar he had eaten so much that he had a tummy ache „ didn't he
so that's what you're talking about when you say caterpillar ache

tummy ache
you don't wanna have tummy ache „ do you
would you like some milk on that
some milk on your cornflakes with a spoon
no

white
it's a new carton of milk „ isn't it
a carton
a plastic bottle
oh the orange juice is in a carton
yes
that's a different type of carton though „ isn't it
I think Mummy might have some cornflakes this morning
I've not had them for a long time
I usually eat the mouthful that you leave
but I think I'll have a bowl all to myself
that would be nice „ wouldn't it
Daddy's home too

Daddy as gone to work
to the chip shop
no
Daddy doesn't work at the chip shop Thomas
Mummy as got to go to work today
but only for a few hours
more milk
yes
Mummy's putting milk in her cornflakes
Mummy as got to go into work today to show other people at work what she does so that if Mummy's ever off somebody else knows what to do
and then after I've done that I shall stay for lunch at work and then I'll go to the Dentist
but I shall be back this afternoon
I'm not going in early this morning and I shall be back sometime this afternoon so Mummy will not be away all day today „ will she
Grandma and Grandad are looking after you
and what will you be doing with them
snipsnips
having your hair cut
no
you need your hair cutting but you're not having it done today
you usually go to Grandma and Grandad's house for that „ don't you
because you go to the barber where Grandad goes
the barber's
that's right
because that barber likes cutting little boys's hair
Mummy's hairdresser doesn't like doing it but Grandad's barber doesn't mind
he as got a proper seat for children „ hasn't he
would you like something else to drink
some orange
it isn't the orange juice out of the carton Thomas
because you've just drunk the last drop if that

you can still have some orange but it's just not the same type of orange juice
it's this orange juice

just looking for Purdie
she's looking at Felix through the fence
did you see that little white van go past then
there's one white van and it had little orange lights on top „ didn't it
and you missed seeing the postman this morning because Ray was coming when Mummy got up and that was very early „ wasn't it

yes
well we didn't wave to him this morning because you were still asleep
and if I was getting out of bed that was about six o'clock
he was already delivering his letters then
and he was wearing shorts because it's quite a nice day today „ isn't it
yes
usually we wave at him „ don't we
would you like some more cornflakes Thomas

I think Mummy's going to have a few more because I only had a couple of spoonfuls
but I really am hungry
Mummy do it
round and round church
oh this is these new pots of Smarties that they've brought out
they're little plastic round containers and they contain little miniature Smarties
and you twist it
you see that on there
that's an arrow and it says twistq
and the arrow's pointing that way
when an arrow points in a certain direction that's the direction you go
are you saying yes and noding your head

what about backside
you're telling me something about outside but I'm not sure what you're telling me darling
I'm sorry
so when I twist it like that
look
oh I see what you're telling me
that's right
backside out this way
you're telling me to go out
it's this way
that's right
and I'm saying to open this pot of Smarties you twist the pot like the arrow says
this way
and to shut it you turn it the other way
ooh twist it that way
there's the hole and out come the Smarties
and you don't get Smarties
and this is an empty pot „ isn't it
it is stuck again
that's it
just twist it gently
the top and the bottom
haha she says
I can't do it either
I think perhaps it's because you've played with it such a long time darling
that it's
that's it
it makes a clicketyclicketyclick noise „ doesn't it

a buzzybee in your mouth
at the front
oh I think you've just had a sip of your orange juice with your training beaker and it made a bit of a noise „ didn't it
I don't think there's actually a bee in your mouth Thomas
if ever there is a bee in your mouth you must get it out quickly and tell Mummy
you mustn't swallow bees „ must you
it'll go buzzbuzzbuzz in your tummy and then you'll have tummy ache
I think that was just the noise that the cup made

all done now
did you enjoy that
right
let Mummy have your cup and plate to wash up
and I'm going to just wash your hands and face
box
it's the draw from your bedroom
that's right
it's the draw that we use a lot when you're having your nappie changed
that's right
when you see Norman out of the window
green sponge
that's right
this is the green sponge that Mummy's using to wash your face and hands
and we bought them last week with a yellow sponge
they were both in a packet together „ weren't they
oh darling you've got something stuck on your face there
it's quite near your eye „ isn't it
it'll come off in a minute
I'm sure
just rub it gently
well your drawers in your bedroom are getting so full and when Mummy had a look in the other day I realized a lot of socks and vests are far too small for you so
you're a big boy now „ aren't you
board
so I've taken the socks and pants out and then boxed them up
put them somewhere else
you're a sillybilly „ aren't you
hello Purdie
what's Purdie now
she's just sitting quietly on the doormat „ isn't she
can you see the bird's feather sitting next to her
I think it's a feather that as just fallen out of a bird
I don't think she as caught a bird

I'll just take your bib off
well we'll have a look at the big box „ shall we
lotsof things in it
yes
well the thing is the
the draws with your clothes in are nearly sorted out
well I'll show you in a minute
but this is a top drawer from the unit
and this is the one we use a lot when you're being changed
what a mess
this is the drawer where Mummy throws everything when she's in a hurry
well look
that's the yellow sponge
can you remember we bought a green sponge and yellow sponge in a packet
well that's the yellow sponge
now just let Purdie
Thomas hold it
yes
you can hold it
paper off
no
leave it in a packet
and that's medicine „ isn't it
open and see
you wanna have a look inside „ do you
now usually your medicine comes in a bottle „ doesn't it
but these are sachets of the same medicine so that when we're traveling Mummy doesn't hafta carry have a big bottle with her
she as always got one of these little sachets in her handbag so if you suddenly don't feel very well Mummy can give you medicine „ can't she
so we've all sorts of things in here Thomas
what a things
it's time we tidied up a little bit „ don't you
look
I've even found a ball that belongs to Purdie
what's that doing in your drawer

look
we've got some facecloths here
that one's a teddy bear
and this one has a WinniethePooh on it
oh that's rather nice „ isn't it
that's right
it's for washing your face
right
can Mummy have these now because they're medicine
you can't play with medicine „ can you
it's a facecloth
what as it got on it
teddy bear
that's right
and it as got two ears two eyes and a nose and a mouth
aah now what have we got here
I think Grandma must have given us that
it's a little blue pot
I can't think what would have been in that
but I would imagine it something she as given you
she as given you to play with when you were having your nappie changed
you press it down
look
no
you don't
you press it that side
that was the hinge the other way
press it down and open
there's nothing in there „ is there
and another facecloth there
and this one's a blue and white stripy one
oh now what have we got here
look at all these
these are all badges from your second birthday cards
they all say number two on them
what we oughta do Thomas
when we're out
is get a piece of ribbon and you could put all the badges on the ribbon or a piece of card
and we could hang them „ couldn't we
in your bedroom
would you like that

well I don't quite know why
that's a picture of ThomasTheTankEngine
well I'm not sure what it's doing in your changing draw but it's one of Daddy's C Ds
I think a lot of things that get put in this drawer are things that you have in your hand when we take you upstairs to change your nappie
when we get them off you and hide them in the drawer and then forget to take them out
a blue box
yes
it's a nice blue box
it's an oval shape „ isn't it
and it as got a dome on the top with a clear lid so you can see inside
now I can't think what would have been in there to start with
would you like to put the badges inside
badges
you've got lotsof nice badges „ haven't you
oh no
the C D doesn't fit in there
I think Mummy better have that
Mummy better have
there are all sorts of things that we ad forgotten about Thomas
isn't it funny how we've not been in this drawer for such a long time
but we go in it every day but we don't look at it properly like this
we've got to go to Jo's house because Mummy as just found a piece of paper that I think Jo would be interested in
it's about your music lessons
they start again on Fridaythetenth of September
and Jo wants to start taking
oh yes
you can put them into that other pot
Jo wants to start taking baby Becky „ doesn't she
so we could give Jo that piece of paper and then she can ring the man
what have we got in here
I think this is a little lock of Thomas's hair
look at that
gosh isn't it light

that's a lock of Thomas's hair
oh Mummy shall keep that
it's not the first lock of hair
because the first lock of hair Mummy as got in something very special

that's naughty
because look what as happened

I don't think you can play with that because that's the thermometer
that's Thomas's hairbrush from when he was a baby
what have we got here
it's the baby lotion
more baby lotion
so shall we leave these badges in a safe place
put them in a safe place and then we'll buy something
to string them onto

and it was here
ah there's a balloon
so Mummy as finally found all the buttons
that's really useful „ isn't there
oh there's all the buttons from Daddy's shirts

I use them to clean Purdie
oh don't you put it in your ear
I do Purdie's ears as well with it „ don't I
Mummy and Daddy use them as well everyday
oh well we won't put it in there
now you've had it in your ear we won't put it back in the pot
oh I might save some space to put the two packets
the two half packets into one pot
and then that's the lid the from the Sudacrem that I've been looking for for weeks thinking that it must have gone down the back of the unit
oh Thomas very exciting „ isn't it
I'm not really sure
oh yes
that's from your vaporizer
when you have a cold Mummy puts that into the machine and we turn it on
it makes a nice smell that comes into your bedroom that helps you breathe a little bit more easily
oh and there's your comb
would you like to brush your hair with your comb
comb your hair with your comb I should say
is that nice
and we've got suntan lotion there for your holiday
oh that's cream for when you've got a sore bottom Thomas
don't take the lid of that please because it's messy
messy
I'm just going to get a little bit of cellotape to tape the bottom of the packet
Thomas be careful
don't pull it round
look
you're knocking a bit on the floor
it's a piece of Bluetac
I keep that in that drawer because when you have postcards we like to Bluetac them on your bedroom door „ don't we

ohgosh
