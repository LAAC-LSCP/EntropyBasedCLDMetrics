to hand back
you wanna play with the eggs
well shall I get it for you

yes
that's yours
because we don't have any tins in our basket „ do we
how many eggs have we got
yes
we've got six eggs now
so one is yours
so we've got seven eggs now
Dimitra needs to take one of those home again
you've found another one

you liked me when you bumps your head
you liked me when I gave you a cuddle and chocolate ball „ didn't you
have you got a bump on your head now

you've got a chocolate in your mouth
and it's better now
what else have you got in the shopping basket Thomas
you tipped them out
you'd like some money
just a minute because we've got some things in here that
these things are a little bit small for you to play with so we hid them in the pot

that must be change
that must be change
Sainsburys
yes
it's an egg box
are you going to put some eggs in the box
they do
you should be able to get six eggs in there
because eggs are very fragile „ aren't they
they break
now when Dimitra comes to your shop and asks for some eggs you'll be able to hand them to her like that „ won't you
buy two get four free
it's great
you didn't
no
you didn't
in fact you didn't get any of them
Thomas do you think Dimitra might like some milk if she's making an omelette
and perhaps some tomato or pepper
I think there's a bottle of milk there near the eggs
not in your mouth
not in your mouth
Thomas not in your mouth
no
if you put any more money in your mouth it's got to go away

I have a little boy at home shopkeeper
and he likes fruit
and he likes apples bananas and grapes

I've got some fruit and some milk and some yoghurt and I've come away with lotsof money
I think I did slightly better than Dimitra's buy two get four free
your FiremanSam
what are you bringing
Thomas
Thomas come here please
you're FiremanSam „ are you
oh I've got a poorly finger and you're putting a box round it for me „ are you
oh that's nice
I think it's more likely to be an ambulance man that's doing this Thomas
than a fireman
oh stay here please
come here
if we've got poorly fingers we don't wanna be left all on our own
oh look
wow
that's better
you've got another hat now „ haven't you
actually you look quite like a fireman dressed in those colors
because they wear yellow waterproof trousers „ don't they
and a dark jacket
why not
it's Friday
oops oh Thomas
oops a daisy
chin
you put your finger in your sausage roll
I think that's empty Thomas
actually „ don't you
no
don't keep running through there
here's your fireman
look
well you carry on being a fireman
I'll
I know you're a fireman but I'm to have a little look at this
why not
well can we not just leave it there
in case we need back up
if it's if it's a big fire you might need another fire engine
no
obviously not
oh bless you
where's your hat
it's here
you bashed it in the fire engine place
you trapped it
can I put my arm in the box
there we are
you've got a newspaper
in your hand
oh I'm having a job to read it because I've got a very poorly hand
ah Daddy was looking for these last night
Thomas
oh well
yes
when Dimitra as finished reading it Daddy was looking for that
have you anything else in your cupboard like that
oh we better have
ah could we have them out please
oh you've got a poorly hand as well
oops a daisy
oh
it's a good job there aren't any eggs in that or they'd break
my leg's hurting
I think it needs a bandage
oh it's
oh it's sore
you think you saw something
no
yes
that's right
what's that
yes
oh thank you
yes
it's very poorly
you've got some more plasters
I think we could do with some bandages really
can I rest my foot on this chair please
it's very poorly
oh yes
that's better
oh that feels lovely
ah since I'm not feeling too well I think it'd be nice to have some grapes
ah but when people aren't well they get grapes
are you
gosh I would need some grapes in that case
what are you building
oh right
we saw some men building a wall this morning in Didsbury „ didn't we
but you haven't got a hammer
you're looking for
you haven't actually got a hammer Thomas
you could just pretend to bang
I want a hammer build bricks
well could you pretend the bottle of milk is a hammer
but very gently
no
don't bang it very hard
very gently
oh you see I don't think a hammer is quite the thing Thomas
those men this morning had some cement in a pot
let's pretend that's the cement pot
and they had a trowel
shall I pretend this pan is the trowel
look
and they put the trowel in the cement pot and they spread in there and they put a brick on top
and they spread some more cement and they put another brick on top
they didn't hammer
they weren't hammering at all
they were cementing „ weren't they
don't you
well I think perhaps some men on the other side were using a hammer to demolish the old wall
but when you're building a wall Thomas
it's cement and a trowel you need
a trowel
where have we been this morning
you don't know
do you not remember going to see Julian
you don't like Julian
oh don't tell him that
he'd be very upset „ won't he
that's a very high wall Thomas
how many bricks
four
no
one two three four
what's after four
you're fed up
I'm fed up with the banging
I don't listening to banging
it's not nice
you don't like Mummy either
yes
I probably will start crying if you say that to me
I don't think Dimitra likes to listen to banging either
it's not nice
no
but Dimitra doesn't
she might start crying as well and then you'll have two of us crying
that's it
it's all done now „ is it
a flower
you'll fall
down please
Thomas
you're a digger man driver
is it
lovely
that's very nice
oh are you going to tell me what happened this morning
remember we went to bangadrumtime
did you sing some songs
did you do some marching
PostmanPat

oh you did that one where he asked you to point to your nose „ didn't he
where's your nose
where's your tummy
your head
your ear
your knee
your neck
elbow
that's your elbow
yes
it was a nice song that „ wasn't it
you be careful Thomas
just a little bang
a lot of bangs
yes
they were a lot of bangs
thank you
Thomas be careful
you're climbing up the digger
the bricks might not fall down but I'm waiting for you to fall down
they're not very stable „ are they
are you going to put the money back in either the purse or the till
no
we're not all going to climb up
oops

I don't know
have you found it

Thomas

what's not fun
oh dear
it's on the floor near Dimitra's big blue box
you're tidying up
oh that's torn „ isn't it
you're jumping out
oops
you don't need them all
oops
you just might fall down now
you're not now
you won't fall down now you've got your hard hat on
you're blowing kiss at Mummy
why are you building another wall
you don't know
is it a wall around somebody's garden
a tower of bricks that reach the attic
oh that's very clever
what did you say about a gate
oh you're building a gate
very good
you're making a lot of noise Thomas
don't throw it
shall Mummy put it on
don't you
you've got two ladders
they're not really ladders Thomas
they're chairs and they're not sposta be stood on „ are they
they're diggers
I'm sitting down thank you
oh I'm not climbing up
I'll sit with you
it won't take Mummy's wait
they're not for standing on
I can't climb up
no
you climb up me like this
oh dear
the bricks have all fallen down
no
what did you say
bang it with your hammer
a lot of noises
more like one person who's very noisy
ah can I not give BobtheBuilder a cuddle
oh dear
ah I'm peeping
look
Dimitra look at this
not in your mouth Thomas
now stop that
that's not nice
I'm only telling you to take the money out for your own good because if you swallow it there'll be trouble
that's not nice „ is it
I don't think so
I don't think it's nice at all
the dustbin wagon
ah
no
it's a secret
it's a secret between Mummy and the box
hm
it's your building brick
stop looking at it
for a look now
oh
is there money on the floor
well do you know where the little purse is and I'll start picking it up
you've thrown it in the dustbin wagon
well I can't see it
a little purse
it's the tin that Thomas keeps his money in
it doesn't matter
we can find it later „ can't we
perhaps I can gather all this money together in this hat
what are you doing
oh somebody knew where it was
somebody called Thomas Lastname
you're a digger man „ are you
well if you're a digger man you need a hat on „ don't you
if you're sat in a street singing Thomas
and you put a hat on the floor like this
people walking past would throw money into it if you were any good
are you going to sing something for me
no
oh well I'm not going to give you any money
how about PostmanPat
you're not ready yet
well I'll give you some money anyway
oh and usually when people are busking they have a little dog sitting with them
there you are
now I'm giving you some money so you can go and buy some food for the dog
ah what's your dog called
Sooty
oh like Jo and Becky's dog
that's nice
well there's some more money there
and there's some behind you
on the floor there
oops a daisy

is this a wall or a tower
a wall
it could be a chimney „ couldn't it

Santa's coming down the chimney
