we don't needta start vacuuming yet
no what darling
no press
no dress
no change
you're bringing the vacuum cleaner through here „ are you
are you stuck
oh I see
you're moving the chair „ are you
you're moving the chair so that NooNoo can come through
but it's not very sensible putting that chair on top of the bean bag „ is it
it's going to fall over
in a minute
now the chair as got all the Tellytubbies in
and they'll all fall out
put it on the floor darling
please
there's a good boy
and then NooNoo can come

oh dear
he as fallen over „ hasn't he
well I'll just finish this cup of coffee
and then I'll pick it up
and that lead
we needta wind it up „ don't we
we'll make it better in a minute
I'll pick it up
can you see all the fluff and dirt that has gone inside the vacuum cleaner
NooNoo as eaten it all up
Thomas don't do that
don't do that
you'll break it
the first time was an accident
but you mustn't try and pick it up
it's a bit too heavy
let me show you
this purple cord
no
don't do anything with it
bring it back please
it's very long isn't it
it's in a bit of a tangle
and it as got a yellow plug on the end
and the
it's dirty „ isn't it
you can
this yellow plug Thomas
you know where that plugs into „ don't you
this way
that's right
it goes into the socket
but you never touch it when it's plugged in
and don't you every try and plug it in „ will you
like
like this
that's right
yes
that's what we do when it's plugged in
you switch the switch for Mummy „ don't you
but you never plug it in
and you never switch it on unless Mummy asks you too
is that right
now listen
inside this purple wire cord
there's lotsof wires
wires
and you mustn't touch them
because if you do
it's like the cooker
it's hot
so when it's switched on
when the plug's in
you never touch this cord
brushing
that's right
you've picked up one of the little brushes from the vacuum
are you brushing the wall
you're going to brush a wall in the kitchen
are you sweeping up
right
are you going to watch me wind this cord up
can you see this yellow clip
put it up like that
pop
and then we wind this cord
look we start at the top
take it to the bottom
can you see this yellow clip at the bottom
wind it round there
and up to the top
and down to the bottom
and round
back up to the top
and round
and down to the bottom
round
up
round
down
round
and then when it gets there
there's another yellow clip
here
squeeze that like a clothes peg look
and pop
then it's all nice and neat „ isn't it
brush NooNoo
you brush NooNoo
that's better
because he brushes everybody else „ doesn't he
and then all the dirt
comes in here look
can you see all that
ugh
that's dust and fluff
it's not poo
it's dirty though „ isn't it
poo it
there's a mess „ isn't there
you've seen on television naughty NooNoo sucks up tubby toast and tubby custard that as been spilt on the floor
watch Pippin
watch Po on
we can't watch anything now Thomas
yes
that's right
the postman's still on
it looks like he might have finished now
don't put the brush in your mouth
it's dirty
and look
two brushes
and that little tool will sit on there
two brushes
two brushes
there're three brushes
that's a clever boy
that's a good boy
ah you giving Mummy a cuddle now
are we going to go to a park later
we'll have some tea
we've just had
oh you've got your Postman Pat book „ have you
is there a picture of Jess
are you going to show Mummy the picture of Jess and the postman
please may I see it
oh yes
that's nice „ isn't it
would you like me to read the book to you
oh you've pressed the button on the bus
on the book
and now we've got the Postman Pat tune „ haven't we
you going to dance
oops
oh dear
that's not dancing
that's jumping
and now you've fallen over
oops a daisy
all fall down
one there
what can you see
what have you got now
Daddy's shoe
that's a bit more than a shoe though „ isn't it
a blue truck
Postman Pat's still on
that's a long video „ isn't it
I think it's
I think it's six storys on one
oh that's a nice blue truck „ isn't it
is that
is that Sam's mobile shop
what're these
big wheels
they're very big shoes „ aren't they
with four big wheels on
do you know what these are called
they're called roller blades
no
there are wheels on these four
but that's a brake Thomas
that's why there's no wheel on that
if Daddy's going very fast
he can tip his foot up
and the brake comes on
and it stops him
oh I think you ad better be careful putting your foot in it
because
oh Thomas has got his foot in one of Daddy's roller blades
whoa
no
Daddy can do it a bit better than this „ can't he
whoa
is that what Daddy does
when he goes to the park
he goes whee
on his roller blades „ doesn't he
yes
I think you ad better take it off
oh when we see Daddy we can tell him Thomas has been roller blading
with one red slipper inside Daddy's roller blade boot
so Thomas
when we're in a rush and Mummy says get your skates on
you know what I mean
is that nice
more
you want the other one on
oh one there
one
well I'll tell you what
you sit on the bean bag
you sit on the bean bag
I'll put the other one here
and we'll help you across the floor
but then I think we ad better take them off
and put them away „ don't you
because we don't want Daddy to know that you've been using his boots „ do we
what would he say
oh he probably would „ wouldn't he
I think this is probably the nearest you've got to the ambulance coming Thomas
right
just one second
and whatever you
don't roll over my feet
or the ambulance will hafta come
right
stand up
and off we go
whee
ohgosh
this is good „ isn't it
are you wheeling
wheeling
backwards and forwards
right
I think you ad better take them off now „ don't you
yes
bye now
perhaps when you're a much bigger boy Thomas
you can have a pair all for your own
and you can go roller blading with Daddy in the park
but I think these are a little bit too big Thomas
so shall we put them away now
oh you wanna play with them on the floor
what else does Daddy
wear when he's wearing those
we'll have words with Daddy when he comes down
because there are two pairs of shoes
and a pair of roller blades
that he as just taken off and left „ hasn't he
does Daddy wear these as well
what are these
these big pads he puts round his knees
can you see
Thomas
that's right
you do them
oh those are elbow pads I think Thomas
right
oh dear
I've sat on the Postman Pat book
and set the tune off „ haven't I
a big tractor coming backwards
oh can you see Post
well it's not Postman Pat
it's whatever the farmer's called
the farmer is riding on the tractor
and it's going backwards
well he's driving in the snow
and that looks like a snow plough
and somebody as got a fork
are they digging in the snow
we won't put that on again now Thomas
there's no mixer
can you see that knee pad
and then we've got this look
Thomas don't
you're hurting my hair
don't please
right
can you see this now Thomas
I've got a knee pad on
and an elbow pad
it's a magazine rack
Thomas got it
what did you do
reach over the chair to get it
yes
it's empty „ isn't it
there's nothing in it
but we're going to put some magazines in it
but this is how you undo them
look
this is called velcro
and you take it off like that
listen
oh
that's a nice noise „ isn't it
that's right
you undo it
oh I see
you're putting Daddy's knee pads and elbow pads into the new magazine rack „ are you
that's right
„ isn't there
at the bottom
bottom of Mummy's leg
it as fastened again with some more velcro
there
there we are
it's off now
oh that's a good boy
are you tidying up
there are two more here look
one more knee pad
and one more elbow pad
this look
that's a good boy „ isn't it
Daddy
Daddy wears a helmet as well
but that's up there look
can you see his helmet on the coat rack
right at the top
near your Thomas the tank engine hat
look
I don't think you can really see it „ can you
no
we'll put these away
and then I think we'll put the roller blades back in the box that they belong in
roll it down on the floor
that's right
put them in one at a time
one at a time
right
oops
there's one
and here's the other one
now that one needs to go in upside down Thomas
to fit properly
look at the wheels
the wheels on the shoes go round and round
round and round
round and round
the wheels on the shoe go round and round
all day long
yes
that's right
it should really be the wheels on the bus „ shouldn't it
sheep

and Dipsy
you're sitting on Dipsy „ aren't you
poor Dipsy
do you not think you're a little bit heavy to sit on top of Dipsy
no

because she's really a back pack „ isn't she

I think you'll hafta start wearing her when you go out Thomas
oh you've got Molly and Dipsy now
on the bicycle seat
and you're sitting on top of both of them
Po's still in the train

no we haven't got a Tinky Winky Thomas „ have we
oh we've had a Po since you were about seven eight months old

and jumping on them
and squealing with delight
but it was church
it wasn't playgroup
and we didn't think it was
that's right
you were squealing like that
so we took you out for a little walk outside „ didn't we
