is that you whistling
that's a nice whistle
yes darling
no
yes you can turn them off please
I was going to just light these candles
do you
I like you
let's have some candles lit
yes you can
I was just thinking we could play in a minute „ couldn't we
that a new torch
now once I've lit these candles you mustn't go
near them
no not with that
no once these are lit we're going through to the other side of the room
look at this a pumpkin candle and one that smells of lavender
that's nice
how's that
now we needta turn the lights off „ don't we
so that we can see them
yes
would you like me to turn that on for you
did you rinse your hands
you feel very sticky
rinse
I know you washed them but did you rinse the soap off
there you are
look we've got your torch as well
there we are
don't you
alright well turn it off because if I turn the other lights off it might be a little bit dark in here
that's like a sparkler „ isn't it
right let's turn the lights off
oh wow
can you see the pumpkin lantern on the table
look at that
now shall I open the curtains
I don't know whether
we've heard a lot of bangs
there were earlier on
but we've been out „ haven't we
I would imagine many of the fireworks now is banging ones not pretty ones
there and anybody outside will be able to see us because we've got lights on „ haven't we
oh there's an aeroplane
I thought that was a firework glowing in the sky
can you see it
what is it
can you see it above Sue's house
it's a
it might be a helicopter I don't know
it seems funny seeing lights on again at Sue's house
somebody as moved in today „ haven't they
they're all
yes
it's very dark
Daddy bought that for you at the bonfire „ didn't he
it's it's called a fiberoptic torch Thomas
well that's just what it's called
watch you don't pull any of the strands out
but isn't it pretty
it changes color
wave it around
did you see
do you remember seeing
okay
do you remember a lot of people we saw had sparklers
do you remember
and you can write your name „ can't you „ with a sparkler
but really sparklers are not safe for little boys like you
but something like you hold
oh no
don't put it in things
but what you're holding now little fiberoptic torch is beautiful „ isn't it
it's like a sparkler
yes
oh you've got your police helmet hat on
right
let's open the patio curtains see if we can see anything from this window
oh there's the helicopter or whatever it was
we saw it from the other window
and it's really quiet later
I would imagine a lot of people have had their fireworks early
and of course it's actually bonfire night tomorrow „ isn't it
pardon
no don't pull on them Thomas
just shake it like that
don't pull on them otherwise they'll all fall out
there
now at nursery do you remember
oh it's beautiful
beautiful
yes

it really is lovely „ isn't it „ that
all different colors
absolutely gorgeous
do you remember at nursery at MrsPlattford's
well we'll put the torch on
you can back from nursery with a black piece of paper
it was a piece of paper that had been painted black
and you put all different colored glitter on it
do you remember
and that was
no you mustn't pull them Thomas
just shake it
don't pull them
and you sprinkled glue on and then onto the glue you stuck lotsof sparkly glitter
what does that remind you of fireworks in the night sky
because I was saying this to you „ wasn't I
it's no good letting fireworks off during the day
it as got to be at night when it's dark and you can see all the sparkles and all the pretty colors
and you made a rocket as well „ didn't you
a blue rocket out of a kitchen roll
and it had sparkly bits on it
well it was a the tube
the inside of a kitchen roll holder
don't pull on them Thomas
you mustn't touch it with your fingers
it'll burn you
just shake it
gently not to pull them
I think you're better just shaking it
it looks nicer
and the rocket had all different colored streamers coming out of the bottom „ didn't it
was it sposta be like a firework or like a rocket
like a spaceman's rocket I mean
whoosh
is it
what does Daddy say
infinity and beyond
well it's not Daddy it's BuzzLightyear „ isn't it
you can „ can't you
wow
it's an aeroplane I think
if we suddenly get a plane landing on the house it's because they think you're giving it a signal
it's very pretty that
isn't it beautiful
are you excited
yes
signal

and they'll take a lot of notice of you because not only are you guiding them with your torch you've got a policeman's helmet on
you know what
the battery's going in this
you've got me saying you know what
I keep saying you know what

oh that was a big bang
oh
Thomas they're over there
let's have a quick look
where Carol and Gordon live
it was behind their house
you've got hiccups yet again „ haven't you
I would have thought the big bangs of the fireworks would have been enough to have shocked you
let's go back
let's go through here with the torch
oh
I don't know
let me put my torch on and
ah
it's a policeman with a sparkly torch
wow
we've got other lights

I think the batterys must be going out because it's not a very bright light like it useta be
thank you
do you remember last year
it was in November I think
this time of year only a little bit later on
perhaps it was December when Fred and Rachel had a fire
do you remember
now watch those on there
do you not remember the firemen came
and you stood at the window with your helmet on
and your torch
and you went outside with AuntieLinda „ didn't you
yes love
when next door caught fire
well it was a Tuesday evening and Mummy was getting ready to go to choir
we were having our evening meal
and I was getting ready to go out
and I knew that UncleBrian and AuntieLinda had been poorly next door
and as I glanced up I could see a blue flashing light through the front door and I thought oh heck UncleBrian's poorly and they've hadta call an ambulance
as I went to the door it wasn't an ambulance
there were two fire engines outside and there were firemen everywhere
and Rachel was standing on the grass holding baby Miles
and the roof had caught fire
so she ad run outside with baby Miles he was only a few weeks old
and UncleFred had phoned for the fire brigade
and then baby Miles came in here for the night „ didn't he
because there was too much smoke in his own house
do you remember that
I didn't go to choir that night
and do you know who came over to see if everything was alright because she thought it was our house
Sue because Sue was worried about us
she thought it was us
and poor Sue's not here now „ is she
but anyway Fred and Rachel had a lot of decorating done and a new boiler put in and everything as been alright „ hasn't it
but there were fire engines outside and you were standing in the window looking at the firemen waving your torch about and AuntieLinda said would you like to go and say hello to the firemen
and you went and you told them they ad done a really good job putting out the fire
you kept saying you've done a good job
and I think they let you go in their
fire engine „ didn't they
they let you sit in the cab
be careful with that on there

please don't bang that Thomas darling
yes
a burglar alarm
your burglar alarm's on fire

and it's dark and he's tired
oh dear
has the rope broken
oh dear
dingdong bell
NormanPrice is in the well


that's a funny one
where would you like me to tie the string
across there
I don't think you're going to be able to get past if you put a piece of string across there „ are you
why do you want me to why do you want me to cut the string if you want me to glue it back on
do you want the string off the lady but you want the on it's own
right
well you can't glue it „ can we
we can tie it back on
there we are
we'll snip it there near the lady's neck

thank you
I'll look after MrsNoah
I bet she is after being in the well
yes
yes FiremanSam
oh will you
mhm
is that a little treat because he fell in the well
hm
it's worth falling in the well „ isn't it
to get a nice treat like that
attached
oh yes
you winding it round the ladder

are you getting frustrated with it
you're breathing very deeply
are you concentrating
hm
yes
I know but it's not easy to tear
listen darling it's late now
I think it's time we got out of the bath
and got ready for bed because it's very late
you're getting a little bit ratty because it is so late
I don't think you can tie knots yet „ can you
you're concentrating very hard „ aren't you
you're determined to do it
now don't lose your temper
well I don't think it's very easy to tie it on to that
it was easy to tie the string round the lady's head because there was a join between her neck and body
where's the piece of string
well have a go
whereabouts love
I can't see
right well I'll try but I don't think we're going to be very successful „ do you
it's quite wide this bucket and by the time I've tied the string I would imagine there's not going to be a lot of string left
right there
how's that
you're attaching the string onto the handle on the bath „ aren't you
a water tower
well I think you need a bigger piece of string Thomas
but it's too late now tonight to start messing with things
well not tonight
excuse me
I'm just blowing my nose now
no I think it's time to get
no it's too late Tom
I didn't cut the string
I busy
shh
I didn't cut it
the only time I cut it was when you asked me to cut it

Thomas when you say snissor that means cut with scissors
well I'm sorry
right let's wash your other foot
well we're not doing a big bridge now
it's
could you stand up please
no darling it's too late
this is why you're crying because you're tired
stand up
shh
enough of that
could you sit down please now
alright
do you feel nice and warm
not feel nice and snuggily
well you should be
you shouldn't
aren't you
well you should be
because it's very cold and
wet and
cold and wet and windy outside
actually I don't know whether it is wet
I don't know whether it's raining outside now or not
it's quite breezy
shh Thomas
well you spend a lot of time at the moment not liking me „ don't you
I think I can cope with that Thomas
because I know very well when you want something you'll like me again
come on let's brush your teeth
let's brush your teeth now
can you
can you hear the tune on the toothbrush
you feeling a bit happier
here are
it's not a water gun
it's a bubble gun
no I think it's fine now „ isn't it
well you can when we get the solution in
okay
it just goes in there like that
we won't put too much in
oh
oh that's it
just a minute I'll hafta get a cloth to wipe that up
just hold on
are you
well I hope this sound of the machine isn't too annoying
but when Daddy and Mummy went for their weekend in London
we brought this back as a present for you „ didn't we
it's called
a bubble blower
it says it makes zillions of bubbles
so what we do is we put
it's it's like a little
well press it there where Mummy's showing you
now we must do it that way
we mustn't get it on your furniture
right
it is
it as got
right but we maybe need more solution „ do we
let's put some more solution in now
when we first used this we didn't think it worked „ did we
and then we realized that we hadn't put the right bubble liquid in the machine
we we ad put some in we had in the cupboard
and really it works best with this
let's just try it now we've got lotsof bubbles
oh
and it
well just a minute
let's check it's working first
oh look at this
gosh look how
oh
it as popped
don't tip it up because if you tip it up it won't work
you've got to keep it very still
that's it

right let's lift it up a little bit
yeah
lift it up a little bit
that's it

just hold on Thomas
sit back
we've got to keep a cloth here because we're getting
the solution everywhere „ aren't we
solution
bubble solution
the last time we did this we actually sat on the kitchen floor „ didn't we
so that when it popped it didn't make a mess on there
I'll leave the cloth there
did we have the door open
it was summer „ wasn't it
wow
look at that
oh you cheeky monkey
blowing it
isn't that big
wow

right let's do one more
just a minute
now don't blow it this time
let's just see how big we can make this bubble
absolutely huge
if we keep the finger our finger on the trigger
look like this
look at this
it's spinning such a huge bubble
if we do little
short ones you can do lotsof little ones look
just wondering whether that noise is too much
mind you it was no noisier then when you were crying „ is it
oh wow Thomas
that's a big one
look at that
oh
it sounds like a machine
what sort of work do you think you could be doing with a machine that made a noise like that
oh you're a builder „ are you
what are you doing builder man
are you BobtheBuilder
are you
you're building a big road
do you know what you could be Thomas
have you seen
I think AuntieMabel might have had a program
don't get your face near it
where there was a man blowing glass
do you remember he blew glass
to make long vases with big bulbs at the bottom for the water to stand in
it looks a little bit like you're blowing glass „ doesn't it
because it's clear and it's round
and all of a sudden it shatters
yes builder man
that's a beautiful one builder man
beautiful
I think when it touches the table that's when it pops
so let's hold it up a little higher
oh
no don't tip it up Thomas
listen
well no I'm fine
but listen darling if you tip it up the the bubbles go in there and then it doesn't work
do you remember the first time we used it we hadta leave it for a couple of days to dry out properly „ didn't we
we mustn't get the bubbles anywhere near the battery
I know what it sounds like
when Mummy was a little girl
and we useta live on the farm
we useta have lotsof trees lotsof branches that fell down in the wind
and when they fell down GrandadBealby would saw them up to make logs for the fire
and I remember this sound around Christmas time on a cold winter's afternoon
and it would be Grandad's sawing the logs
not with a handsaw but with an electric saw
we useta have a little handsaw as well
and it
something called a sawing horse Thomas
it was made of wood and you could put
it's a beautiful bubble that
it useta be a wooden frame
yes
you know like we have a clothes horse for drying the
the clothes
well this
this is fantastic
what a big one
it's like a big balloon „ isn't it
look at that
oh that's right
keep your finger on the button
that's bigger than a balloon now
it's absolutely huge
look at that
wow
it's like a spaceship
look at this
ah it as popped
but never mind
it was fantastic that one
do another one like that
so we have a clothes horse for drying our clothes on
and Grandad had a sawing horse and he useta put big logs on this and then he'd go along with his saw going chuchuchuchuchu until he ad made little logs
do you remember when we were going to the Beehive in Didsbury
we walk down SandhurstRoad and we see that big pile of logs „ don't we
watch it doesn't get on your fingers darling
oh just rub your hands on the cloth
this is a lovely relaxing way to end your day „ isn't it
does it need some more liquid
right well let me go and get some more liquid then
so isn't this a nice relaxing way to end your day
calms us down „ doesn't it „ before bed
it does need a little bit more liquid yes
