I don't think you were cross
you were having a whale of a time
if anybody should have been cross it was me because water was going boo
everywhere
you had a little blue cup and you were watering Abigail's shoulders and back „ weren't you
because she's only nine months old
she's only a
and her head
oh yeah
you watered her head
but we said noq not to do that „ didn't we
I think you thought you were helping to wash her hair
but it was better when you just did her shoulders and back „ wasn't it
you enjoying those
that's right
Thomas a bath
and Abigail a bath
it was lovely
no
we weren't cross Thomas
we just said no don't do that
because it's only she's so much tinier than you Thomas
we weren't cross with you
it was very sweet of you to do that
but yes it was certainly a busy day „ wasn't it
and we've had lotsof washing up to do today
and are we going to go out later on
would you like a little sleep after lunch
no
I think you're starting with a cold „ aren't you
yes
some more crisps
there you are
are they alright
because they've been open a day or two
oh yes
they taste fine
they've been sealed up so they're still nice and crunchy crispy „ aren't they
now what have we got here
ham and cheese and crackers
shall we put some spreading cheese
on the crackers

Isabelle's Daddy's a nice man
and what did we do at Sonia's house
storys
she read you a story „ didn't she
while Mummy did some washing up and some hoovering
and some washing
and we played outside
we had lunch and we all played outside „ didn't we
and we played inside
and you and Isabelle watched the ThomasTheTankEngine video „ didn't you
and then Sonia read you a story
a lot of things going on
pardon
oh
Thomas Percy and the trucks too
yes
there were a lot of things on the video „ weren't there
in fact Sonia as lent you the video „ hasn't she
and we also
with Po on
no
it just has ThomasTheTankEngine
but we discovered that the music that you like singing
the theme tune to the ThomasTheTankEngine video
we discovered the words to that „ didn't we
because normally when we listen it just says choo choo choo
but we actually discovered that there are words
can't remember what they are but
a big crash
where's there a big crash
on the ThomasTheTankEngine video
was there
no Gordon
what do you mean no Gordon
there we are
there's a little cheese sandwich there sweetheart
if you'd like it
no thanks
you just asked for a sandwich darling
there's lotsof things to eat anyway
you like those little crackers „ don't you
are they crunchy
you were saying yes listen
I'm listening
oh yes
they're crunching „ aren't they
crunchy
what else do we listen to
RiceKrispies in the morning with milk
that's crispy as well
not crispy
but we say listen because we listen to them
they go snap crackle and pop „ don't they
would you like a drink now
no
no thank you
looks like the bananas in the fruit bowl need eating as well Thomas
I think we'll have bananas for lunch
Thomas certainly can eat it
yes
oh it's not when
it's just a little brown mark on the banana
you've got that from Daddy
because Daddy doesn't like eating the bananas when they've got little bits of brown on them „ does he
it's not
it's just when they get ripe they go brown
or when they get cold they go brown
that's why we don't keep fresh bananas in the fridge
if they go in the fridge they get too cold and they go brown
yes
Mummy's going to have a banana
oh Thomas
you do sound snuffily
I don't think you're really one hundred percent today „ are you
no cent
no
not a hundred percent
and who did you see at bangadrumtime this morning
oh that's Julian with a mouthful of banana
we saw Julian „ didn't we
a funny man
he's a nice man
but he does lotsof funny things „ doesn't he
jumping around
leaping up in the air
another banana
well it's the same banana
it's just that I've cut it into two pieces
and first you ate one piece and now you're eating the other piece
chew it properly „ won't you
and we sang hippity hop to the shop to buy a stick of candy this morning „ didn't we
we've not sung that for quite a few weeks
more
another one
you'd like some more banana
oops
there we are
oops
take the peel off
there we are
another little mark on it
look
there we are
I'll just take the knife and slice that little bit off
there you are
there I'll cut that into smaller pieces
chew it properly though poppet
don't eat it all at once „ will you
listen
there's some nice slices of cheese here
nice cheese
look
you'll like that
oops a daisy
hm hm
ha ha
boo
are you laughing again
mm
that is nice cheese
oh you're making the crackers fall out of the packet on purpose
no
the cheese doesn't make a sound
you've just picked up a slice of cheese and held it too your ear but it was quiet „ wasn't it
no sound from a slice of cheese
no
the cracker doesn't sound either „ does it
the cracker just sounds crispy and crunchy when you're eating it
but not when you hold it too your ear
what about the slice of cheese
did that make a noise
the little boy Sam was in trouble a lot at music group today „ wasn't he
he didn't seem to wanna do anything that Julian wanted him to do
he was in trouble „ wasn't he
Julian kept saying sit down Sam and not there Sam
don't talk Sam
and listen Sam
but Julian as known Sam for a very long time
another little mark on Mummy's banana
yes
there we are
with a knife we'll just pick that out as well
so I don't think Sam gets too upset when Julian tells him off
because he as known him since he was a tiny baby
pardon
no
he wouldn't sit for Julian „ would he
he wouldn't sit still and Julian gets a bit cross when people don't behave themselves „ doesn't he
at music lesson
and that's why Mummy says to you that you've only got to talk when Julian says to talk
when he says sit down you've got to sit down
you kept going to get more instruments „ didn't you
and for the first
yes
Mummy's instruments
Yes
you were most concerned at one time
well because only the children had instruments and the parents didn't
and you were most upset because Mummy didn't have an instrument „ weren't you
the sun's shining outside now
it's nice „ isn't it
all done
well you can't watch Pippin now
you watched Pippin this morning
Pippin and AuntieMabel
with FiremanSam too
I think

what do they wear on their head
mhm

on the morning of teddy's birthday the postman brought him a special letter

teddy loved trains and wished he could be an engine driver one day
the next day teddy's father took him to a real railway station and teddy met an engine driver
you could wave the train off with my flag said the engine driver
teddy stood on the platform and waved the flag as the train pulled away
teddy was too small to drive a real train
but you can drive the baggage cart said the driver
ah that's what it is
that funny looking car thing that you call a tractor is actually the front of the baggage cart
look
teddy's driving at the front and he's pulling along some trolleys all loaded up with suitcases
