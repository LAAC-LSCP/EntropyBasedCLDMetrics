are you happy playing with your shop while I carry on cooking tea
Thomas
you want me to go to the corner shop
well I'm sorry
I don't shop anywhere where the shopkeeper calls me a silly woman
if you want my custom you better not carry on speaking to me like that
we're just cooking some tea „ aren't we
what are we cooking
can you tell what we're cooking
can you smell it
yes
it's not chips
it's pasta and we've got bacon
yes
what do you need Thomas
actually I think the bacon's quite near being cooked
it smells very nice „ doesn't it
very tastie
and buns
it's very hot
I'm just going to wash these small tomatoes as well
you can't see the tomatoes
don't you
you always say you don't like everything Thomas
but usually you do if you try
it's just you won't try things „ will you
look at these small tomatoes
I'm just going to give them a wash Thomas
first
alright
if I give them a wash you sell them to me in your corner shop
and I'll cut them in half and put them on the grill pan
no
that's not the grill pan
that's the stamp weigher „ isn't it
the postal weigher in your postoffice
yes poppet

oh no
don't bang it down like that
you'll break it
right
if I dry these very carefully
you're going to put them in the freezer
that's right
now you've got to treat them very carefully because they'll squash and they'll make mess everywhere „ won't they
is there some that are in there
well shall we move the orange juice up there and the milk
and we'll put
how many tomatoes are we putting in the shop
one two
oh Thomas the other door's open
you must shut it at the other side love

well if you're the shopkeeper you should be loading them in at that side „ shouldn't you
look
we'll shut it at the shop side and just put them in at your side
but you must treat them ever so carefully because they're very fragile
look
you open them at that side
no
that's the side that the customer comes to
you needta open it at this side „ don't you
that's it
right
how many have you got in your shop
yes
you do
because Mummy wants to buy lots when she comes to the shop
how many tomatoes have you got in your shop
that's right
just a minute
I'll go home and get some money
and then I'll come and
yes
but I haven't
and I've got to buy the tomatoes from your shop
have you
ah well
I've got some money

three tomatoes for two pounds
right
now let's have a look at these
these are those tomatoes

the cornflakes have fallen out of the shop
look
these tomatoes you sold me
look
I'm going to slice them in half like that
can you see all the seeds inside
it's FiremanSam
look
I'm going to pop them on the grill pan
now you can't get fresher than that „ can you
straight from the shop and onto the grill pan
oh who's ringing
who's phoning
hello
hello MisterShopman
your shop's closed actually „ is it
is it
oh so if I need anything else I can come to the shop „ can I
a lot of the stock as fallen down
oh dear
so what's going to happen Thomas
if it as fallen down
have you
oh well perhaps that might be nice for our meal
do you think it would be
do you know the other thing I'm going to pop on the grill pan Thomas
this banana that as been lying here all day
because you didn't want it at breakfast time
it might sound a bit strange but hot bananas are really very tastie
what are you putting on the scale pan
oh orange juice
oh right
you hafta weigh the orange juice you're selling me „ do you
there's your orange juice
ah thank you so much
how much is the orange juice
that's two pounds as well „ is it
right
one fifty
and two fiftys make one pound
and a pound coin makes two pounds
there you are MisterShopman
oh thank you
thank you very much indeed
I enjoy shopping at your shop
what darling
yes love
you've got some stamps
well I don't think
oh yes
I do
I tell you what it's Grandad's birthday next Monday „ isn't it
well perhaps I'll have a couple of first class stamps then I can post my letter to Grandad
and then we can post your letter to Grandad
birthday cards
what do you think
does that sound like a good idea
have you
actually we've been to the real shop on the way home „ haven't I
so I've got
hello Ginger pussy cat
oh Purdie's sitting with us so I don't think we can feed Ginger „ can we
oh Ginger always wants some food Thomas
because unfortunately the people Ginger belongs to don't seem to feed him very much „ do they
oh dear
Purdie as seen him now so this should be fun
oops
can you hear Purdie spitting at Ginger
she's upset „ isn't she
it's a jolly good job we didn't put any food out or Purdie would be even more upset
oh don't get upset Puss
yes
I don't think Ginger's particularly bothered „ is he
he's just going to sit there
oh Purdie don't get upset
you're on the inside
he's on the outside
you tell her there's no needta get upset „ is there
what did you say to Purdie then
no
it doesn't matter Purdie
we love Purdie „ don't we
we like Ginger
he's a bit vicious but we quite like Ginger
but Purdie would always come first „ wouldn't she
Purdie's our pussy cat
right
well
did I actually pay for those two stamps Thomas
for Grandad's birthday card
can you reach alright darling
oh I tell you what
right
I've stuck the stamps on the card
I'll post Grandad's birthday card now while I'm here
oh it's a little bit too thick to go through the letterbox
have you posted lotsof things
right
I'll post them both first class now because I'd like them to get there in plenty of time
is it
thank you
yes
right
are you
GrandmaDaisy
and what are you saying to GrandmaDaisy
Nana's feeling better
yes
I think Nana is probably feeling a lot better „ isn't she
we went to see NanaDaisy „ didn't we
last week
and who else
Nana Lastname
well we see Grandma „ don't we
but it was GrandmaDaisy in York we went to see last weekend „ didn't we
was that nice
are you
you're opening the letterbox
why did the postman say gosh
were there a lot more letters there than he expected
excuse me
why are you calling me silly
because what
because I owe fifty pence
has she
oh I don't think Purdie's enjoying having Ginger staring at her „ is she
she probably feels a lot happier now he as gone away Thomas
right
I think it's time I turned the cooker off now
we usually do a tape before Mummy goes to work on a Wednesday „ don't we
we didn't manage it this morning „ did we
so it as got to be teatime instead
right
has Ginger gone away now
good
that'll please Purdie „ won't it
a little cheese
I'm just going to put some on your plate
that's a good name
what's a good word
little cheeses
they're little strips of DairyLea cheese „ aren't they
you call them little cheese
yes
so it's your good name „ isn't it
your good word for them
well we must buy some more cheese from the supermarket
how big is this cheese
it's okay
and you like it
but Mummy needs some cheddar or something a little bit stronger
mind you
you quite like strong cheese as well „ don't you
if I put a tomato on your plate are you going to eat it
are you going to tell me you don't like it
I might put your pasta in a separate dish Thomas
are you going to try some of this baked banana
it does taste very nice
who as posted money in the postbox
have you
that's right
when the postbox is closed it's dark „ isn't it
dark inside
and what do you think as happened
do you think somebody who's holding some money ready to pay the shopkeeper must have accidentally have posted in the postbox
it's a funny thing to do actually „ isn't it
post money in the postbox
you would have preferred it in your till „ wouldn't you
MisterPostman
you're calling me Jean
I suppose you're not really Thomas at the moment „ are you
you're the shopkeeper
and it's possible that the shopkeeper would call me Jean rather than Mummy „ isn't it
am I Mummy Jean
that's Grandma's name as well „ isn't it
Grandma Lastname is called Jean
I'm just slicing some onion now Thomas
no
I don't think I'll give you any
just smell this
it smells ever so strong
did you know what an onion smelt like before
can you smell that
does it smell nice
nice and strong
I don't think you particularly enjoy onion Thomas
it might be a bit strong for you
having said that you like cheese and onion crisps „ don't you
and Mummy puts some onion in cooking „ didn't she
when we're making things like I'm making this pasta dish now
so I'm slicing up onion
does Grandad grow onions
Grandad Lastname and GrandadBielbie
they both grow onions „ don't they
they grow lotsof things in their garden
and then
yes
well GrandadBielbie as got a shed too
yes
well Grandad Lastname has a greenhouse and GrandadBielbie doesn't have a greenhouse „ does he
green claws
green claws
Nana's friend
oh you've lost me Thomas
I don't know now what you're trying to tell me I'm afraid
you're talking about letters
you're coming out with lotsof silly words
I don't really know what you're talking about Thomas
do you know what you're talking about

you haven't a clue what I'm talking about
and I haven't a clue what you're talking about

they are „ aren't they
and why has the postman not closed the postbox door
oh good
yes
that money keeps turning up „ doesn't it
I do think it would be more sensible if you put the money in the till Thomas
before it gets lost
that would be a shame „ wouldn't it
right
tea is cooked
wow
I think it's cool enough to eat
so shall we just tidy away for a moment and we can play with the shop later on
well I think so
it's teatime now
we'll play with it after tea
we wanna eat our meal when it's nice and hot „ don't we
where does this credit card live Thomas
does it live there
oh I see
ah right
yes
that's a little place you can swipe it „ isn't it
shall I load up the shop just before we shut for the night
I'll restock the shelves with cornflakes and biscuits
cornflakes and biscuits
oh the door to the shop's open again
now we said the bottom was the fridge „ didn't we
so we put the orange juice and milk there
cornflakes and biscuits the next one up
and then there should be some canned food somewhere
where are the tins of canned food
oh perhaps somebody bought them
oh here we are
there's some more in the back
look
a tin of peas
oh and a little tin of spaghetti there
right
the shop's nicely stocked now
right
shall we change the sign now
are there
well I tell you what
let's swap the sign
there we are we'll close that for the night
we'll put the sign up that says closed
yes
and
why don't you empty the postbox and then all the letters could go to the sorting office „ couldn't they
I'm going to be a sorting office „ am I
there we are
the shop's closed
look
is he
oh well you could let the postman in
because the postman needs to collect all the letters „ doesn't he
right
there we are
the shop's closed now
are you going to open the box for the postman so he can put all the letters in his sack
why
oh I see
he didn't wanna use the key
he just wanted to use his finger „ did he
I see
he is quite a clever postman „ isn't he
yes
there we are
no
the shop's closed now
it's teatime
right
have you cashed up
there we are
we'll put that money in the till
oh they'll hafta wait for the morning collection now „ won't they
right
that's it
well people can still post letters „ can't they
in the postbox
even though the PostOffice and the shop is shut
but I thought they were staying there now till morning
oh I see
you're going to empty it once again „ are you
right
there we are
are you
you're putting it in there for safekeeping until the morning
well should we put those letters in as well
oh I see
oh yes
right
night night shop
night night shop
oh no
we needta leave that sign there that says closedq
otherwise people would be wanting to come in „ wouldn't they
so we must leave that there because it tells everybody the shop is now closed
okay
are you going to go to the bank and put all the money in the bank
somebody as turned the television off
have you
I don't think it was on actually „ was it
was it
right
you washed your hands before but let's just wipe them again before you eat your meal
are we going to have water again with our tea
no
what would you like
nothing
oh that's fair enough
okay
who as got nothing to eat
who's stuck
oh the duck
oh Thomas I can't keep up with you
I didn't know you were a duck
there you are
would you like a fork
there you are MisterShopman
you've had a very busy day „ haven't you
working in your shop and PostOffice
so I hope you enjoy your meal
pardon
you've got jelly crocodiles and snakes
there you are
now eat your tea nicely please
we bought the cheese in the shop „ didn't we
not in your shop but in the shop in Didsbury

oh that smells lovely
it's more like smell like custard
does it smell like custard
that's right
you can talk while you eat „ can you
that's clever
who likes pasta
who likes pasta
who does
Michael likes pasta
Michael who
Michael the butcher
oh did he tell you that
no
oh you're just assuming
or are you pretending you're Michael the butcher
ah
well we bought the bacon from Michael's shop „ didn't we
it's very nice actually Thomas

well this is very tastie
because you just like plain pasta „ don't you
but I've got sauce on mine
would you like to try one of the tomatoes that we bought in your special shop
they're very good for you Thomas
you have „ haven't you
would you like some baked beans
no thank you
what do you say
no thank you dear
I think it was an aeroplane
because I saw it in the sky
it looked very bright
did you not see it
do you know what this is
it looks like a sausage but do you know what it is
it's a banana
you try that
it's really nice
that's a special banana because that as been cooked
are you enjoying your meal
don't throw
if you don't want something just leave it at the side of your plate
you don't throw things
oh I can have that piece „ can I
a piece of cheese
oh that's kind
thank you
mm
this is nice
you saw this in a shop and wanted it „ didn't you
we've had this cheese before „ haven't we
oh no
I think that was somebody's car
I think it was a car setting off from behind the house


yes
your friend Robert lives there „ doesn't he
oh do you think it was his car going past
I don't think it was actually
I don't think their car sounds noisy like that
and when we're at Robert's house we can see your bedroom window
and we can see the spare room bedroom window but we can't see Mummy's bedroom window
and we can't see anything at all downstairs because of our tall trees „ can we

yes
when we're at Robert's house we can see where you sleep „ can't we
and we can see where Robert sleeps from here
so I don't think Robert could see you now because he wouldn't be able to see above the tall trees
and we couldn't see whose car that was because of the trees
but we could hear it and it was very noisy „ wasn't it
well I thought perhaps if you were going to try the banana or tomato you might need your spoon

you've plenty to eat
if you don't need the spoon just leave that on the side as well
are you going to use your fork to eat your bacon with
oh you're using your fork for the pasta
it sounds like some children are playing out
they are talking loud
they're laughing „ aren't they
that's nice to hear though Thomas
because it means they're having a nice time „ doesn't it
they must be enjoying themselves if they're laughing because people don't laugh if they're sad „ do they
that's right
if people are sad they cry
it's just something that happens
if you're happy you laugh
if you're sad you cry

oh if you've nothing to eat you'd be very sad
that probably would make you cry „ wouldn't it
if you felt very hungry
yes
well that's what babies do when they're hungry
and you
no
you don't cry but when you were a baby you did
because you can talk now you can say Mummy I feel hungry
but when you're a baby like Sarah
Abigail's sister
she's too small to say I'm hungry
and the only way she can communicate is by crying
when babies cry it can mean lotsof things Thomas
it can mean that they want a cuddle or that they're bored or they're tired or they're hungry or they're thirsty or they hurt somewhere
a baby's cry can mean all sorts of different things
it's like a guessing game trying to guess what sort of cry it is
with you if you were tired I always knew your cry
in fact you still cry sometimes if you're very tired
and it's the same cry
and if you're hurt
if you're poorly that's a different cry
and babies have a different cry when they're cross
when they're very frustrated and they want something and they can't have it they have a different cry
a bad tempered cry
pardon
this cheese is fold
you're folding up a piece of cheese „ aren't you
a strip of cheese you've bent into a loop
you've folded it up
you've put it on your nose and cheeks
it looks like you've got a moustache now
hello
you can't remember what you're talking about
would you like some more pasta Thomas
oh ladys and gentlemen
would you like some more pasta darling
no
there's plenty more in the pan
yes please
well what about some cheese
would you like some cheese as well
and what about a drink
a nice drink of water
there you are poppet
that's quite alright
brilliant
brilliant
Mum as given you some cheese and some pasta
I'll just get some more cheese for you
some milk
well you can have some milk at bedtime
you don't have milk now
there we are
it's called strip cheese and that's exactly what it is
well where would you like them
put them on the table
okay
sorry about that
Mummy didn't know where they needed to go „ did she
that sounds like a child screaming
I don't know love
pardon
he wants something
no
that was a happy squeal
that was a happy squeal of delight „ wasn't it
like children squeal again when they're happy
they sort of squeal
not a scream
oh is that piece for me
oh that's very kind of you
thank you
I better eat it before it melts
I don't think cheese will melt
cheese melts when we put it on toast and put it under the grill
and it gets very hot
what's on the floor
oh yes
you're saying last night when I made hot buttered toast
it wasn't last night
it was a long time ago
it was one breakfast time „ wasn't it
the toast caught fire „ didn't it
which is one of our favorite tricks
and I don't know how we manage it with an automatic toaster

that's right
when Daddy set the toast on fire it was brilliant
it was pita bread and it set the smoke detectors off „ didn't it
and Daddy lifted you up so you that you could see it

that's right
Daddy hadta take the battery out to stop if ringing
and then when the smoke had cleared Daddy put the battery back in
and to test it was working he let you press it to check that it was saying beep beep
we've got to do that every now and again with smoke detectors
you've got to press them to check they're still working
oh very soon I think Daddy caught the pita bread on fire perhaps on Sunday and by Monday I'd set the breakfast toast on fire
but you're talking now about the toast being outside because when it caught fire I threw it out of the patio doors
so it landed on the ground outside
because we didn't want a fire in the kitchen „ did we

oh there was smoke everywhere

yes
we could have done with FiremanSam „ couldn't we
that night
but Mummy as just cooked a meal now Thomas
we've had the grill on and the ring „ haven't we
your pasta as never been on fire
we've never hadta throw pasta
a clean and dirty what darling
oh I don't know what you're talking about now
we've never hadta throw pasta outside
we threw the toast out one day because it was on fire
well FiremanSam likes to do a lot of cooking
was it something you've seen on FiremanSam video
did FiremanSam set fire to
oh well it's obviously FiremanSam because MissusPrice is on FiremanSam „ isn't she
MissusPrice said
your Station's on fire
was she talking to FiremanSam when she said that
on the television
ah so did FiremanSam hafta throw some pasta outside because he set fire to it
yes
oh
oh well you've confused me Thomas
did they race together
FirefighterSam and FirefighterMorris raced together
did they rush together to put the fire out

did she
why did she disappear
you don't know
did she run so quickly that she went out of site or did she disappear into the place that was burning to put it out
was she
mm I enjoyed that
did you enjoy yours
a robot
there is a robot
I don't know it's name but I know the robot you mean
BentleytheRobot
is it
oh right
there was lotsof water all over the place and Firefighter who fell on the floor
he lay on the floor
did he slip on the water
is that why he was lying on the floor
I see
did you enjoy that
no
well you've eaten all your cheese and nearly all your pasta
please have a little piece of bacon
no
I don't want anymore thank you
well I'll taste one piece but I'm fine thank you
you taste the other piece
you like bacon
okay
fair enough
if you don't want it that's fine
you've had cheese and pasta
would you like an apple now Thomas

I've finished that piece so I've got to eat that piece „ have I
I really don't want anymore Thomas
I'm not going to eat anymore thank you
would you like an apple or a banana
no
don't do that
now what happened with that strawberry
no
the strawberry
you ate such a big strawberry you were nearly sick
you've put about four or five pieces of pasta in your mouth together
you've got to be steady
if you push it all in like that you will be poorly „ won't you
hello Tom
oh
I just fell over my shoe
I'd taken my shoe off and I'd forgotten
I've just stepped back and tripped over it
there you are
if you could possibly eat that
that's the rest of the pasta
I did „ didn't I
crash and bang
yes
I nearly did all those things „ didn't I
well it was a bit of a shock Thomas
I wasn't expecting anything to be behind me
right
I'll just peel part of this apple
well not now
after tea perhaps
is it
well you'll just hafta manage without the engine Thomas
because
yes
but while we're just finishing our tea let's just have a bit of peace and quiet „ shall we
Mummy as had a very busy day at work
oh you've found the stamp and money „ have you
you've found

no
really
Mummy as had a busy day at work
Thomas I don't want any noise tonight thank you
you can have it in a few minutes
am I
well it would be useful if I'm on fire but
if you're standing so close to me FiremanSam surely you can manage to put me out without sending a fire engine with neenas on
well I'll give it to you
siren once and then it goes down if you keep pressing it
I don't wanna hear the siren
Daddy's on fire next
Dimitra's on fire
who's on fire
Jeannine
you can't say Jeannine „ can you
but really
oh goodness
it's Jeannine not Jean
no
no more sirens Thomas
come on
let's just finish our meal please
you can play with that later
you don't need the noise Thomas
I don't need the siren
well I don't want the siren
if you press it siren again it's going away
you can play with it
no
your once more is always about ten times more
no Thomas
you can play with the engine but you're not to keep pressing the siren
I don't want any noise at the moment thank you
no
you haven't finished your tea Thomas
you've got
do you really
right
well in that case you're still not taking your fire engine
well let's just wipe your hands then you can go and sit on your potty
no
no
you're only saying that because you wanna leave the table
in a minute
but listen
listen to me
when I say no it's no good just going on and on and on expecting me to change my mind because I won't
let's go and get your potty „ shall we
do you wanna start pulling your trousers down
I've got to just dash upstairs and get the potty
you're not getting anything to play with that makes noise Thomas
no
the tractor doesn't make a noise „ does it
you play with noisy things all day and you have the television on all day
surely when we're having a meal we can just have a bit of peace and quiet
right
do you wanna sit on your potty

there you are
you sit on your potty if that's what you left the table to do
good boy
you can still talk to me „ can't you
yes
when you're sitting on your potty you can still talk to me „ can't you
there you are
you need it very dark
what do you mean
you want me to go away
okay
are you sitting properly
oh good boy
you're a clever boy „ aren't you
for telling me
you need it darker and darker
mind my feet
well I'll just move this over
you like to be private „ don't you
that's right
well I shall carry on with my cup of coffee and you can talk to me
what would you like to say
pardon
you needta see FiremanSam's engine
you have got some toys that don't make a lot of noise
it still makes a bit of a noise but it's only a clicking noise „ isn't it
no
no
at the moment you're sitting on your potty
have you finished
well go and wash your hands
and then you can choose another toy
oh thank you
yes

pardon
well PostmanPat would you like to go for a little walk after tea
well I know
as long as PostmanPat's going to pick them up afterwards
because we've got a telephone number we needta take to Jo and an address
and it's easier if we just take the card with it all written down on than ring her up and tell her „ isn't it
Thomas don't

but listen Thomas
if you don't pick them up at the end of the night there'll be trouble
because Daddy's going to come home and he's not going to be pleased „ is he
if you're going to have toys everywhere
Daddy gets quite cross because just before bedtime you seem to take all the toys out and then leave Daddy to pick them all up „ don't you
pardon
