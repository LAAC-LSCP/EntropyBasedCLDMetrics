I beg your pardon

do you mean when they go backwards
oh well I'm sorry
I didn't know what you meant
yes
right
I still don't quite know what you mean
well tell me again
raspberries
ah how do you know what it was
yes
we were playing with them yesterday
and you didn't put them away in a box
you just left on the floor
so I thought it was just as easy to put them straight back onto the window
the patio window
no
last night Daddy went up to the top of the garden with a bowl
and he picked some
they're not raspberries
they're called errys
well they're like raspberries „ aren't they
would you like some
I thought you might
would you like some honey nut loops
I'll look after your bus
should I leave it here at the side of the table

that's a good lad
I'm going to hafta wash these berries
look at those
don't they look nice
freshly picked from our garden
smell them
they don't really smell like raspberries
do they
and them we'll get them washed
them you can have some
I've got some strawberries in the fridge as well Thomas
you call what nutnuts
what do you call nutnuts
you might need some sugar on these Thomas
I don't usually give you sugar on these but
yes
these are a little bit sharp
well you mustn't eat too many
they won't hurt your tummy
it's just if you eat too many
do you want some raspberries
sorry
some strawberries with them
silly me
I got mixed up „ didn't I
no
I said raspberries
I meant berries
would you like some strawberries
would you like to choose them
well you can choose the strawberries you want from this
we didn't grow those at home „ did we
although we've got some strawberries
what do you say
that one because it's extremely big „ isn't it
what do you say
you like it extremely big
what would you like
what do you say
yes please dear
who as taught you that
MisterMagadoo
who's MisterMagadoo
PidgeonStreet „ is it
PidgeonStreet
is he the PetShop owner
he calls everybody a little petrol
I think you're making that up „ aren't you
yes
I'm just going to wash them
the tables
no
don't do that
don't do that please Thomas
right
I'll just leave those to drain for the moment
do you have some cereal with those as well
I'm going to have some cereal with mine
I'll try one of these berries
would you like to try one
do you like it
would you like a little bit of sugar with it
no
right
I'll put the berries at that side of the bowl
I'll sprinkle a little bit of sugar on the side
no
what are you thinking about
just a small amount sugar
alright
but I'm putting the sugar on the spoon
that's it
that's the only amount sugar you can have on a teaspoon
there
how's that
would you like to keep this big spoon
and do they taste nice
yes thank you
you're PostmanPat eating the strawberries quickly
right
there's your honey loops as well
I shall pour myself a cup of tea now
yes
but when your strawberries are finished you've got your honey nut loops ready „ haven't you
somewhere in here we've got some milk
lotsof nice fruit in the fridge now
we've got peaches and strawberries
cherries
and we've got berries from our garden
and we're growing some blackcurrants but I don't think they're ready
blackberries
I'm not sure if they're blackberries or blackcurrants
I think they're blackberries
I'm not quite sure but I know what blackberries are
they look like this only they're black
they're a little bit smaller
a bit rounder and very black
purpley black
but they're not ready yet
we'll hafta keep going down to the bottom of the garden everyday Thomas
and see what fruit's ready and get it picked „ won't we
and we've got some strawberries lying on the patio in those tubs
I don't know whether you remember last year we had strawberries „ do you
well we ate them last year
in fact you ate most of them because
the trouble is

the trouble with the strawberries is when they're ready you only get two or three ready at a time
we couldn't really do an awful lot with them other than just eat them
so you useta eat them when they were ready
but the berries we can do things with those because we get quite a lot „ don't we
if we don't go everyday to pick them
then the birds come over and they eat them
I don't mind the birds eating all those red berries that we look at in the park
and we say we can't eat them because they're for birds
but I don't want the birds eating all our fruit
I don't mind the odd thing
that's right
we wouldn't have any left at all „ would we
if the birds ate them all
yes
do you remember when we walked past Carole and Christopher's house
she has some cherries growing on a tree „ doesn't she
and they fell on the floor „ didn't they
but they're for the birds as well „ aren't they
they're not the sort of cherries that we buy in the shop
we don't wanna eat them
well they look fairly much the same
they're much smaller „ aren't they
but we don't eat those
we leave those for the birds
if you're walking past Carole and Christopher's house and you see those cherries on the floor you'll leave them alone „ won't you
only eat cherries from Mummy's fridge or cherries that Mummy or Grandma gives you
well yes
if you're a butterfly
but you're not a butterfly „ are you
funnily enough
just pretending
pretending to be a butterfly
oh steady
now that's silly „ isn't it
no
they don't
butterflys don't use spoons „ do they
I think it's an aeroplane
it must be quite low „ mustn't it
it's not coming to pick us up
no
it sounds like it's low enough to come to the house but I don't think it will

oh excuse me please
what's the matter
my hair
rabbit's hair
I haven't got any rabbits Thomas
have I
I don't think so
I think that's TeletubbyLand that has rabbits in the back garden
I don't think I have any rabbits „ do I
in DidsburyPark
she has
AuntyTricia as got a rabbit called Molly
you're quite right
oh Thomas bless you
you don't need a sweetie to cheer you up
you've sneezed once
there's nothing the matter with you

yes
that one's much more pink than the others „ isn't it
the other's quite a dark color
do you like them
you like fruit
a fat tummy
you've got a nice figure
just the right size
pardon
oh cheers
yes
that's a funny thing to do „ isn't it
you normally do that with glass „ don't you
drinking glass
there's no reason why we can't do it with cereal bowls
you will have some cereal „ won't you
yes
which one
it's just a bit smaller than the others
I think it got crushed when I was washing it
it doesn't matter
that's the thing with things like strawberries and raspberries
they're very fragile „ aren't they
they're very delicate fruit
soft fruit
it doesn't take much
well they are
it doesn't take much before they get squashed „ does it
you hafta treat them gently
it's very quiet outside „ isn't it
there's just one at the side
did you enjoy those
oops
it fell off the spoon
no
I don't think you should have too many more Thomas
it might upset your tummy
what would you like
some more strawberries
anything else
no more strawberries
raspberries
honey nut loops
yes
I'm not throwing them away
do you really not want anymore strawberries
you could have two more
which one
that's five Thomas
well you don't have anything when you say I want
what do we hafta say
no
no
oh well sit there until you say please may I have
oh well
now sit there until you say please may I have
then I'll consider it
meanwhile I'll just
I'll carry on eating my cereal
would you like a cereal bar
you sillybilly
please may I have
a drink of juice
juice from fruit
right
please may I have
come on
ask properly
don't mess with that
if that falls on the floor and gets dirty you'll be in trouble
pardon
you don't care
what don't you care about
you don't know „ do you
you just heard Mummy say it and you copied
I say I don't care when I'm cross with you for doing something and you say I'm just
and I say I don't care
because I might say to you don't play on the stairs and you say I'm just running upstairs and I say I don't care what you're doing
come down
that's how I say I don't care
you're just saying I don't care because you've heard me say it
well I think if you start saying that to people Thomas
you'll find that they don't care a lot for you either
they won't like you if you say I don't care
you should always care about things
it's like when you're being a naughty boy „ isn't it
when you're being a good boy and you're all smiles a happy boy everybody likes you but if you're grumpy and miserable
well if you're grumpy and miserable and having a moan nobody wants anything to do with anybody like that „ do they
steady
just a minute
phone
Sue
well Sue just rang me about something to do with work
well she wanted me to know something before I went into work

that's a silly thing to do „ isn't it
right
you saw a bus driver in Stockport banging his bus with a stick
with a bangastick
that's a funny thing
I wonder why he was banging his bus
would he not work

did he say bang silly bus
I think he'd have been better taking it to a garage than hitting it with a stick „ don't you
he sounds like a silly bus driver to me
he's having a ride on the top of the bus
that's dangerous „ isn't it
what will happen if he goes under a bridge and there's only just enough room for the bus to get under
he'll get squashed „ won't he
you're a driver now „ are you
I don't want the bus
thank you
I'm sitting at home looking out of the window at the sun
oh I know
but I like looking out of my garden window
I'll only go on the bus if the driver first comes in and has a slice of toast

that bus sounds very noisy

Milo and the Tweenies
Milo has an axe on the Tweenies

just a second
last Christmas you weren't
oh I can see the postman coming
you weren't very well last Christmas
just before Christmas
and when you were feeling a bit better we went to Mollys party in Glossop
we went on the train
and at the party she had a children's entertainer

do you remember he did things with those balloons
you can't remember
you sat on it
and then the last thing he did
oh look
the parcel force lorry is here as well as the postman
the last thing he did was he did like a puppet show
a Punch and Judy thing but it was little red riding hood
and you really enjoyed that story
and then at Christmas last year Sue bought you a book of FairyTales
and the first story in it is red riding hood
and has it been on the Tweenies as well
ah is that why you keep saying dear because of the little red riding hood story
because I think the Grandma and the wolf when he was pretending to be the Grandma called everyone dear „ didn't he
Thomas do you really not want that toast

well wipe your hands and then you can
the parcel van
the parcel force van as driven off „ hasn't he
