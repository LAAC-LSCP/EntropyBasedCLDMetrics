and what's she wearing
would you like to out your torch in her so we can see
she as got a fur hat

she looks a bit like FatherChristmas „ doesn't she
and look
when we start
she's holding
look

oh there we are
oh that makes a lot of noise
she as got two little buttons
and this one that we press she's moving her hands from side to side
and she's moving her torch and she's singing
no
well if we press the other button she can start singing
but it makes a lot of noise „ doesn't it
so she as got a torch as well
shall we put the music on just for a second
JingleBells

we won't let her sing anything else
when her hands go back together that's it
we'll turn that off
so she as got a torch „ hasn't she
like yours
that's right
like mine
when you've finished playing with your torch Thomas
no
well she made quite a lot of noise
it was the motor on the choir girl „ wasn't it
when you've finished playing with your torch Thomas
we must remember to switch it off otherwise the batterys will go flat „ won't they
yes
that's right
you can see them with your torch „ can't you
and look
we've got another candle here
this is one like Holly has
let me go and find some matches
now we've got to be very careful with matches „ haven't we
and candles
but this is a candle that Mummy was given when we went to the ChristingleService at church
you didn't come because you were poorly
so Daddy stayed at home to look after you
and I went and we sang carols
and when it came to the last one
away in a manger
everybody was given a candle like this to hold
look
it as got a special little dish round it so the wax doesn't drip down
and we sang Away in a Manger
so look
this candle's like the one Holly's holding
isn't it
that's right
are you shining the torch on it
you mustn't get too close because it'll burn
isn't that beautiful
shall we sing Away in a Manger
are you going to sing

JingleBells
well you sing JingleBells
you want me to sing JingleBells
that's right
talks round and round and round
you can whiz the torch round and round making patterns on the ceiling „ can't you
JingleBells
we heard JingleBells before Santa came „ didn't we
on ChristmasEve you were getting ready for your bath and we turned the radio on and we could hear sleigh bells
jingle
jangle
and we heard a man say
when you can hear the sleigh bells Santa's coming
and I think he must have been at Ben and Charlotte's house
somewhere round there
no
you've opened all your presents now
you didn't open them all on ChristmasDay you saved some till BoxingDay
you saved some till yesterday „ didn't you
yes
and then you went to bed quickly „ didn't you
because we thought FatherChristmas was very near
and I think you'd had a busy day
and you still weren't very well
you went to sleep quite quickly „ didn't you
are you going to blow this candle out now
don't get too close
one two three
are you going to say MerryChristmas

it's you
you must give a really good blow

don't get too close

you can smell hot
yes
that's the smell when a candle as just gone out
you can smell a hot
don't touch it because it'll still be hot on the wick
that was nice „ wasn't it
hot on the wick
that's right
the candle's made of wax but the little bit we light at the top's called a wick
would you like me to change that to the green button now
you like the red one best
it's nice and Christmassy „ isn't it

and you thought the ginger looked like a jelly sweet „ didn't you
and you ate it
but it was quite strong „ wasn't it
and you hadta spit it out
do you remember that
what can't you see darling
would you like me to put the big light back on
no
you're enjoying playing with that „ aren't you
you're enjoying that

I tell you what
we haven't got the lights on on the Christmas tree or the Welcome lights „ have we
shall we put them on
let's just move the chair out of the way
the trouble is the Christmas tree makes a little bit of a noise „ doesn't it
when we turn the lights on
there we are
we've got Welcome lights on the window and we've got Christmas tree lights on
and if you look over to that house where the little girl lives they've got lights in their window „ haven't they
can you see
well let's look out of the window
you stand up there
can you see right over the road
can you see the lights in their window
yes
they're pretty „ aren't they

they're like yours
that's right
yes
a lot of the neighbors have Welcome lights
and look at the lights on the tree
where
here
look
the sparkly ends keep changing colors „ don't they
yes
a little bit as gone
don't hold them
just look at them
it's a pretty tree „ isn't it
when we've gone out for walks in the evening when it as been dark we've seen all Christmas lights and Christmas trees in people's windows „ haven't we
is it a reindeer
oh it is a reindeer all hanging on the tree
and do you know what this is Thomas
this is another decoration from the tree but this is the lantern
and you know the candle Mummy was just holding
if we had a very tiny candle perhaps like the ones we get on
yes
perhaps like the little candles we have on birthday cakes we could put it inside there
then that would be a lovely lantern
that's a
a lovely lantern
that's a little girl with a bow „ isn't it
yes
that looks like an apple „ doesn't it
what else have you got in the tree
a star
yes
a star at the top
and look at this
it's a stocking
a Christmas stocking
do remember hanging your stocking up for Santa
well there's a stocking on the tree and it as got a little teddy bear with a gift
looking out if the top there's another teddy bear
look
you got this teddy bear here
last Christmas from AuntyJoyce „ didn't you
look
we've brought him out again
he's a white teddy bear and he as got a bib on
what color's his bib
and
green
it's a green bib with a red trim and in white
do you know what that says
it says happy Christmasq

he's a little white teddy
look
and he as got tartan paws
happy Christmas
so we're going to hafta keep him „ aren't we
oh Thomas be careful
it's alright
every year you're going to hafta get him out „ aren't you
he's our little Christmas teddy bear
pardon
everybody not getting out
shall we turn the torch off and put the big light back on
no
you're happy with your torch „ are you
what other lights can you see shining Thomas
well I can see a red light shining up there
there
in the corner of the room
just wave your arms
just flap a little bit
look
can you see the corner of the room above the mirror
can you see that
right
you keep watching that
you can walk towards it and see what happens
ah look
it as lit up red
that's the sensor on the burglar alarm
so every time you go near it lights up
and I think the other night when FatherChristmas came down the chimney
oop it as gone off again
but when FatherChristmas came down the chimney and he started walking between the fireside and the Christmas tree to put your presents in the rocking chair I bet that light went off
because you asked FatherChristmas to leave your presents in the rocking chair „ didn't you
oh it's on again
and what did he do
he left
he filled the stocking „ didn't he
that we left in your bedroom
and what else did he leave in your bed
it's on again
he left a red parcel
what was inside the red parcel
he left that in your bedroom
a TinkyWinky
and then when he came downstairs
you found it
oh that's it
let me have a look
isn't he lovely
that's right
you shine your torch on him and then we can see properly
ah TinkyWinky as got a pink face
he looks like Po
doesn't he
with a red face
and then when he came downstairs Christmas morning he'd left some more presents in the rocking chair
what had he left
he ad left sausages in the fridge „ hadn't he
like he promised
but what about the fire engine
and what about the train set
are you going to get the fire engine
you were very lucky because he ad left
he ad filled the stocking in your bedroom
he put all sorts of things in there
he put some Christmas Sellotapes and a satsuma
and some books and a video
and he left TinkyWinky in your bedroom and a little note to say I've left the others in the rocking chair
and it was a fire engine and a train set „ wasn't it
and then when we went to the fridge to get some milk to make a cup of tea what did we find
sausages
because you'd asked FatherChristmas for sausages „ hadn't you
yes
oh what else had happened when we looked at the hearth
all done
where had the mince pie gone
yes
FatherChristmas's tummy
and what about the glass of sherry
that had gone in his tummy as well
and what about the carrot we'd left for Rudolph
ah
that had gone in the tummy
whose tummy
FatherChristmas's tummy
or Rudolph's tummy
Rudolph's tummy
there was a tiny bit of sherry left in the bottom the glass and there were two crumbs left on the plate
and who ate the crumbs
Thomas
but there wasn't any of the carrot left „ was there
not a bit of carrot
and he ad moved this „ hadn't he
we hadta move this so he could get through
when he came down the chimney we realized he wouldn't be able to get out because of the fire guard
so Mummy moved the fire guard „ didn't she
and after he left presents presents in the rocking chair and in your bedroom he put the fire guard back „ didn't he
he didn't put it quite where we have it „ did he
he put if fairly near
at least he tried
he tried
he must have thought oh best put the fire guard back otherwise Thomas will get burnt in the fire
so this is TinkyWinky's first Christmas
yes
you're showing TinkyWinky the ladders on the fire engine
there you are
he can sit there „ can't he
wow where's the fireman
he as fallen down „ has he
oh yes
he's there
the other lights I can see Thomas
are the lights on the microphone
look at these little green lights
ah there's a light on the television there
what about round the corner
what can you see
oh Daddy's newspaper
you're going to just leave them there „ are you
this fireman's nice „ isn't he
yes
that's his little oxygen tank
when he goes into a building and it's on fire it's full of smoke and he has a job to breathe
he carries that little yellow canister on his back
like a very big flask
are you going to turn your torch off now you're not playing with it because the batterys will go flat „ won't they
no
they will Thomas
if we don't turn it off when you're not playing with it the next time you go to use it won't work
it's working
oh it is working now
yes
but if we leave it switched on the batterys will run down and they'll go flat
and the next time you think oh I wanna shine a light on the ceiling you're going to turn it on and it won't work „ will it
would you like to bring it to Mummy and I'll turn it off for you
they're not flat yet but they might be soon
is that how we turn it off up there
that's it
put it in the back of your bicycle
oh I don't think you can climb up the fireman's ladders
a fireman can climb up the ladders
yes
oh you're putting the ladders
you're putting the fireman's ladders up my jumper
TinkyWinky's watching all this
so you've now got TinkyWinky Dipsy LaLa and Po „ haven't you

yes
of course
is he too big

he's a little bit too big
PostmanPat might fit in

PostmanPat's not as big as TinkyWinky
he's a little bit bigger than the fireman so he might not fit in but
oh look at that
