I hope you're not meaning I'm stupid „ are you
right
you're playing with a toy that's got a lift „ aren't you
does it
does it
looks like a post box
it does actually „ doesn't it
yes you're quite right
and that's the outside of the lift „ is it
did she
did you play with it when Nana was here
yeah well pussy cats do that
when they want feeding they sort of
climb up „ don't they



I'm not quite sure what dogs do Thomas
because I've never owned a dog
well I mean I must have seen dogs when
people are feeding them but

I think my friend's dog
when it wanted feeding useta go wowowowow
you know when the owner was actually putting
the food on the plate
the dog got rather excited and
barked a lot
but I don't know whether they
I don't know what they do
because pussy cats like Purdie
I mean she when she hear
well she doesn't hear so well now
but she useta hear the fridge door opening
and they can also they've got a good sense of smell
she can smell it
and she useta come trotting along
and she rubs round your legs
and she climbs up the cupboards „ doesn't she
when she wants feeding
oh well Felix is a very friendly cat
Felix rubs round your legs
just when you're in the street „ doesn't he
a lot of cats do that
is it
when pussy cats rub round
your legs when you've got shorts on
yes I would imagine it is

what have you found
oh yes put that down please
that's one of the tapes that we've recorded „ isn't it
what were you doing
looking through the hole in the middle

is there a hole in the middle
no
because of this
oh no
there isn't
what am I thinking of
think I'm thinking of cds „ aren't I
they have a hole in the middle
took us a long time to say that „ didn't it
c what is it
c b
I can never say it
BBC on choice
ten
yes
that's C beebees
children
I don't know what it is sposta stand for
children's what
children's am a Kate
what's that mean
no
but CBBC
was children's BBC
that's what CBBC is
children's BBC
but it's turning into beebees
which is for little children
is that right
there's some that likes it that are ninety
oh I'm sure you don't hafta be a child to watch it
I mean I watch it with you
and I'm not a child
people that are forty are not allowed to watch it „ are they

pardon
oh are you
oh well I'll carry on watching it then
when you're sixteen
but you're sixteen a long
time before you're forty Thomas
so if you're too old at sixteen
then you must be too old at forty
don't you think
that sounds very confusing
I've dropped the sausage
oh yes what did you say you were playing with
a sausage factory
oh right
sausage powder
mm
do you think sausage is made from powder
that doesn't sound very nice
food coloring
food coloring
are they vegetarian sausages
well I'm
yes I do
I'm just wondering whether
they're vegetarian sausages
with them being green
because I think if the sausages were bought from Michael's Butchers were green
I'd take them back and say these sausages are off
don't you
I don't think that would be at all nice
oh does Purdie want cat food do you think
white cat food
perhaps she's heard it's a sausage factory
and she thought it was ordinary sausages
not vegetarian ones

that would be the sort of thing that
Purdie would like „ wouldn't it
well I've seen her eat the odd sausage
but
not her favorite
I think the thing is when you're here
we don't have any left over sausages anyway „ do we
we don't because you eat them all up
and even if you don't eat them in one meal
we have them for lunch the next day
or at least you do
well I wouldn't do it Thomas
if you can eat it I wouldn't
but if there's ever anything
you know a time when you
well yes she likes cheese
she is a good vacuum cleaner
she's a good good girl altogether Purdie

we'll hafta start calling Purdie Ning
you know how you useta call me NinNin
and Purdie could be a Ning Noo „ couldn't she
like the teletubbies

I would imagine so darling yes
no Thomas
don't you don't
Thomas
no
Thomas stop it
turn that television off
no
don't put the television on
oh there was still teletubbies
well that'll serve you right then won't it for doing

gone off teletubbies a bit „ haven't you
you like teletubbies everywhere
well what are you going to play
I know
how do you play sausage factory
I visit you like I do at a pigsty
visitting pigstys
do you know I do find this food
that Purdie eats hopeless because
she just doesn't eat the chunks
she just eats the gravy
she leaves all the chunks just to dry up
don't look at me for more food puss
there's plenty there
you keep saying that to me
yes
she just seems to like the juicy gravy part
you can't just have the juicy gravy part „ can you
I don't think so anyway
well I'll come and play you tell me what you're doing
what's that
that looks like a breakdown truck to me
oh I see
a hook on to hook all the sausages on
oh did you not know that
it spins round
oh that's very handy „ isn't it
so that means that you can
if you can turn it
doesn't it
it is „ isn't it

your breakdown truck
or whatever you're calling it is
is certainly bigger „ isn't it
well that's a bit odd
you don't get many vehicles that are bigger than a
factory Thomas height wise „ do you
and what's in the back of the truck
grapes and flakes
grapes and flakes
grates
grates and flakes
and what
what are grates and flakes
well that looks like a bit of lego to me
it looks like the plough from your tractor
and your neenahs from the fire engine
well I don't quite understand
well it is
I've just scraped the old food
onto the new plate
no
because it's not old food actually
it's just that she's

I'm going to scrape a few biscuits off
and see if that will help
right
here we are
you
watch the floor's wet
come on quick
I've just cleaned the floor
just that's it
I just hadta wipe the floor when
she was eating
no
don't
she's not naughty
she probably thinks you're very messy as well
there you are puss
what's a life saver
what's a light saver
that doesn't sound very nice „ does it
a life saver
well I don't think a life saver kills people
a life saver must be something that
saves people's lives
isn't it
a light
oh a light save
you mean like a laser gun
type thing oh
mind you I suppose if you had a gun
and you shot them first
and somebody made you shoot
then it would be a life saver „ wouldn't it
because it saved your life
before the other person got you
ha
a light saver
I hope I wouldn't be that naughty
that you wanted to do that to me Thomas
wouldn't be very good „ would it
think she's eaten a bit
yes she has actually that's good
right
now here's a tray
I've just washed her tray
we're not now
she can wait until the next mealtime
right
oh she's come back

pop round
I don't think she's been out this morning „ has she
maybe that's why she's wandering around
Thomas please will you stop shouting
now I don't actually know where the
keys are to the
oh here they are
to the door
come on Purds let's see if you wanna go out
I've just opened the door for a few minutes
no
leave her she's
she
no
leave her please Thomas
she's on the stairs
she can see the door's open
and if she wants to go out she'll go
don't because I don't want her going out if she doesn't wanna
what's she doing
settling down
is she going out
oh good we'll just leave her to go naturally
without chasing her please
would you like anything to eat Thomas
no
well I'm going to sit and have some apple pie now
is that alright
another piece of apple pie
but I'm here Thomas
and you're there
what are we doing
that's okay then
oh no
you don't just sit there Purdie
you're either in or out

I don't think she quite knows what she wants to do „ do you
right
we'll leave her a few minutes
then we'll open the door and she can come
in again „ can't she
shush

no
I think she's had enough
Thomas
is that off the bottom of the chair
it's one of the little felt pads „ isn't it
so do you actually make sausages at that factory Thomas
oh
what
oh
oh that sounds good
actually I'm not going to have some apple pie
I'll just have a very quick sandwich
are you sure you don't
yes I'll have a sausage thank you
actually that would be nice
are you sure you don't want anything now
yes please
if they're made there
in your special factory
oh it is
and oh it's being delivered
by the chap in his truck
thank you so much
that sounds nice
I've just said it sounded nice
and I meant it looked good
I know I realized what I'd said
got all muddled up and forgotten where we were
forgotten what I was doing
what forget what they're doing


and what does that do
oh right
when you say it squashes them
do you mean it makes them into sausage shapes
or it packs them
right
I see
well that sounds like a very important piece of
equipment then „ is it
yes
yes
goodness me
when a sausage is behind you

I bet
I imagine it's quite a dangerous
place to work „ isn't it
do you
what do you have the digger there for
that doesn't sound very nice Thomas
I don't think I'd like to eat sausages
that a digger had digged
didn't it
ah I see
yes
I was about to say the digger had digged
but I think I meant digger dug
digger dug
the digger had digged

digger dogged digger dug
the digger had
the digger had dug
mhm
is it
right
what's the matter Thomas
don't do that please
Thomas what are you doing
what's the matter
drive mad
well I don't think I'll do business with you
if that's the attitude you take
you don't sound like a very good business man to me
I don't think people would usually say
if you don't eat my sausages
I will smash into your house
sounds very strange
oh right

mm that tastes good
that does taste good
and I was quite surprised to find that it was hot as well
a hot sausage
do you cook then at the factory as well
do you cook them at the factory
have you
oh I just wondered why the sausage was hot when I ate it
well I forgotten these aren't
normal sausages „ are they
these are very special sausages
made with powder
I'd forgotten that
yes
with your eyes closed
and so there's a playground in the factory as well
oh I see
they were building something and they
thought what shall we make
and they suddenly decided a sausage factory
but before then it could have been a playground „ could it
right
I'm just going to see if Purdie's coming in
going out
wanted it open
I was about to say we'll see if she wants to come in
but she nearly knocked me down „ didn't she coming through
has she got wet

yes well I can see she's wet Thomas
a soggy moggy
stop it

leave her alone
well there's no point touching her „ is there
getting yourself and her upset
oh Purdieta
hm she needs a good drying off I think
what do you think she wants
gravy food


well I'm just putting a bit of fresh to mix with the old
I hope that she'll eat some of that
now I've just cleaned your tray Madam so don't make a mess
ugh she's wet
her tail ugh

horrible
what's surprising
doesn't look as if it is „ does it
well it must be because Purdie
oh Thomas
don't
have you
right
I needta sit down there Thomas
oh yes
you've put a flower
in the tray „ haven't you
sit down please Thomas
excuse me please
looks like Purdie
I don't understand what you mean
yes
Purdie don't run across the ironing

leave her alone
she's come to see
she's having a wash now „ isn't she
to get rid of the rain
it's funny really because if we go out in the rain
we wanna get dry but
Purdie actually washes herself
if we wash ourselves we get wet
Purdie washes herself she dries herself as well
mind you I must admit sometimes if we've been
very wet do you remember when we went to the park once
all your clothes are wet
we came straight in
took our clothes off dived in the bath
had a lovely hot bath
and then dried ourselves and put clean clothes on
so that's what Purdie's doing „ isn't it
did she sneeze
oh yes

why what's happened
oh dear
right
Purdie's enjoying the company
she's shaking her head a lot
I don't think she's very happy about the rain

you have
that's actually a
no
don't rip it Thomas
you've
because it's not a toy
well you should be careful
well it's a piece of rubber
that's marked like and shaped like a sunflower
and it's purple
and it's actually a jar twist
it's useta grip jars and bottles
to open the tops
but do you know what I use that one for
to put underneath the books
the cookery books on
the kitchen bookshelves to stop them slipping
because they were a packet of two
and I use one for opening jars
and that one's a sort of bookend
but don't damage the hook
part otherwise we won't be able to hang it up
so is that part of making sausages that flour
yes
oh is it
purple sunflower
no
oh you've flattened it
you're making it into
well it's because it's not a real sunflower
put coloring in them
right
put purple food coloring in it „ have you
to make it look like a
to make it look like a purple one
I don't think Purdie would like purple
cat food Thomas „ do you
oh

there we are you see
she's letting you know what she thinks about that idea
I think it was a definite no that
your bottom's itchy
whereabouts
oh Thomas
and has it tickled there before
well that's not where the poo comes out „ is it
let's have a look
you banged yourself last night „ didn't you
when you fell
I still don't
let's see if you just got
when you hit that part of your back
right at the very bottom of your back
on your bottom
it's called your coccyx
stand up
and let me have a look
because that can hurt
and that's possibly what you've bruised
there
oh yes
yeah you've
it's sore as in
like a bruise you mean
yes I know
it's because you banged it
you landed on your bottom when you fell

right
yeah you've got the dustpan now
mhm
so why do you need bricks at the sausage factory
they do
there's a special name for it
but I can't quite think what it is
mhm I can now
right
be quick Tom
come back in here quickly
come on Thomas
hurry up now
come on quick
come on don't get very many
because they've all got to be put away in a minute
come on
right
that's enough
wow that's a lot
right
don't get any more please
because if they're not picked up at the end
of the day you know what Daddy said
in the bin it goes so just remember that
there's
no
Thomas put it down
very useful that dustpan and brush „ isn't it
now what are you going to do
right
that's the cellar in the sausage factory „ is it
mhm hm
like a squirrel
what are you getting now
mhm
a cone
is that to warn people of danger
do people hafta wear special hats and coats
when they enter your factory
and there's my sausage there
look
on the table that you gave me
I'm going to just pop a light on
because it's not very nice „ is it
a job to see
what's that the cooker
just mind because the microphone's there
right
no
well I don't
what does it do Thomas
press it and we'll see
oh it plays the wheels on the bus
that's that little book
birthday's Teddy surprise „ isn't it
I mean Teddy's birthday surprise
oh wasn't it funny this morning
when I said
Daddy's gone to work
and you said which teddy
and I said not a teddy Daddy

you thought I'd said teddy had gone to work
did you think it was one of your teddy bears
from your bedroom

and where do you think Teddy would work
no
but where do you think he would work
a teddy factory

that's quite funny „ isn't it
that you thought I said teddyq
you look very puzzled
put all the mixture in water
well is that powder sausage powder
oh well I suppose you hafta put the
powder into water „ don't you
mix it up and make it work
no
don't put it on the table Thomas
and what does the big brush do
right
get that brush off the table please
it sweeps dirty floor
so we don't want it on the table
mhm
oh you be gentle watch the
handle might drop off
a cuppa
cooker
mhm
I bet it is
I think you hafta have special gloves on „ don't you
oh I don't think firemen could stand in an oven Thomas
not even in with the special clothes
I don't actually get in the oven „ do you
not when it's lit
mhm
well surely if things are put on trays and
rollers and they slide into the oven
surely you don't hafta stand in the oven
that sounds a bit too dangerous
mhm
that seems a long way up
parasault
oh
I've never seen a fire engine do that before
it was hovering above the factory
was it spraying water there
is that how they put the oven out at night
what was it doing
water landing
oh Thomas
I just said be careful „ didn't I
now don't shout in Tom
I didn't realize what you'd knocked off
and suddenly I saw the light flash
but I think it's alright
think we're going to get wet when we go out
no
would you like some apple pie
hm
I bet you are
well I've just had a nice tuna sandwich
and a small piece of apple pie
would you like some cheese
your headache and your poorliness have gone
good
and what would you like
you don't want lunch
but would you like a piece of cheese
make a sausage
oh I can't make a sausage roll
pastry it's pastry
very good
orange skin
hm that doesn't sound very right for sausage rolls
well that was silly „ wasn't it
because she's not
why did you tell them your cat was dead
because what
she had a what and then she was dead
a war
Purdie had a war and then she was dead
you mean she had a fight with somebody
well that wasn't nice
because when she does die you'll be very upset Tom
we all will
yes well I was going to say when she
does die and you tell them
they won't take any notice
because they'll think he's just saying it for sympathy
because she's already dead
and you'll be upset and nobody will bother
because they'll all think you're just making it up
ah
one of her kitten's called Bamboo „ isn't it
she probably wouldn't take any notice
but Georgia will know when Purdie dies
because she only lives opposite „ doesn't she
because we'll tell her
he is
is that what it says on that piece of wood
Thomas danger
quite dangerous having a Thomas in the house
it's quite dangerous having a Thomas in the house
isn't it
that fits very well at the bottom of that slide doesn't it
I don't think you should use that as a hammer Thomas
because that's part of another toy
and if it gets broken
well the other part's missing „ isn't it
so one part's missing
yes please
one part's missing
and if this part's broken
then we'll be in a right mess with the toy „ won't we
won't work at all then
it sounds a very strange factory to me
sausages coming down from the sky and
it doesn't seem right
well I've never seen a fire engine fly
I've seen sometimes
television pictures of when there's
say a bad forest fire
and shoot water out „ don't they
they jet water down
but I've never seen a fire engine
swinging in the sky like that

is there actually a fire at the sausage factory
or is it just putting the oven out
well surely it would be better just to
turn the oven off „ wouldn't it
and let it cool down
you really need the fire brigade to come out
so does this happen every single day
that the sausage factory's working
but what happens if there's a cat stuck up a tree
or an accident or a proper fire
and the fire engine's busy putting your
oven out
is that not dangerous
well that must be very expensive
but what I was meaning was if
if there was a house fire
and you needed the fire in an emergency and they
they said oh sorry the fire engine's busy
putting the oven out
and somebody could be hurt
while the fire engine's busy doing that job for you
you seem to be having more and more fire engines
the ladders
just gently don't break it Thomas
well just do it
pass it to me
just do it gently
well don't
that's it
that's it
just very gently
slide it back in
because this is the only fire engine with
ladders that works now „ isn't it
well would you like to pass it to me Thomas
and we'll sort it out
rather than forcing it and breaking it
there you are
they don't seem to be very stable fire engines
those toy fire engine ladders
oh well they hafta „ don't they
at least I would hope they would be
this does seem to happen with all yours
and I don't quite understand what the problem is
there we are
they don't hate being your toys
you're a nice little boy
there you are fixed
perhaps the poor ladders are worn out if they
hafta keep putting the oven out in your factory
could imagine ordinary fire engines proper fire engines
wouldn't hafta use the ladders every time
because some fires that they go to
they wouldn't needta use ladders
yes but that's what I mean if they hafta
put the ladders up to put your fire out
every single day
poor ladders are probably worn out
mind all those things
I don't think the fireman would be very pleased
because if he thought while he was trying to put it out
you were in the control room making it hotter „ do you
now what's that do
does it
what because your bottom's hurting
I don't think they'll deal with that
well I thought we were playing this
in a few minutes I think it's time to go and brush your teeth
and then we'll get you changed
because we're going out later „ aren't we
Thomas no
no
come here please now
Thomas I shall get cross
turn it off now
do as you're told
you're not allowed to touch that
what's your favorite program
not just yet
I thought you were still playing with this
well you needta pick all these things up
before you can watch television
why don't you park everything at the side
put the fire engine away
and this piece of wood and then you
can move the other things to the side
don't hide it under there because we won't
Thomas
come on because we won't know where it is
and is this still at the factory
this little sound
and what does that do
because if you're packing up the factory
surely you don't want the oven getting hotter now
it isn't „ is it
well will it not go on the box
well it belongs on that box Thomas
well if you put it on the box
well it's only a
moment to move it „ isn't it
Thomas I'm just putting it on this box here
listen if it's left lying around
you don't hafta move anything
to get it out you just
pick it off the top of the box
it's not even in the
now listen
if you leave it on the floor
Daddy will get annoyed
or worse still he'll accidentally tread on it
because you've just said yourself it's
not very stable „ is it
and if he treads on it you won't have a toy then
it'll hafta go in the bin
I will love
where is it
right
come on
put the back on
this is team effort Thomas
I'm holding the the
dustpan and you're brushing up „ aren't you
yes I think I'll let you get it all into a pile
before I stand there holding that
you look like somebody who's blind with a white stick
it's the handle from the brush „ isn't it
oh yes being on crutches is
hurts under your arms a lot to be on crutches
well because you're putting all the weight on the
you're using your arms instead
of your legs to walk „ aren't you
well you can use one leg but
you needta put your weight on the sticks
right
would you like me to put the brush head back on
and then after this
you don't play with it again Thomas
because it's going to get broken
no
Thomas that's been sweeping the floor
don't put it in your hair
there you are
no
my arms are fine
got to beat the buzzer
before that music finishes you've got to have
it all swept up
quick

more haste less speed
oh
don't break off to switch the button just
keep sweeping quick
right
oh here's Purdie in
quick Thomas
oh now your brush head's fallen off
just use the brush head to sweep it in by hand
Purdie doesn't sound happy „ does she
well you didn't manage that in the time „ did you
that reminds me of that BobTheBuilder book
you got for your birthday
where you've got to turn the timer
and you've got so many seconds
to do all the jobs on each page
do you remember
you turn the timer round
and each page asks you to do a little task
and you've got to do it before the
sixty seconds are up and the pinger goes bing
right
I'm going to
no
well I'd like you to just carry on tidying that up
okay
don't rush so much Thomas
that by rushing so much you make more of a mess
just do it slowly and gently
take your time
I will when it's finished
is this what you make the men do at the factory
at the end of the day sausages
it isn't
you've nearly finished
right
are you going to go and tip them back into the box now
it is
well shall I put them back in the box for you
you look after that one
I will
watch your fingers Thomas
I can hear the pitter patter yes
have you
who said that
oh
your bottom's nice
because you've got a brush attached
oh it's not a brush it's a dustpan „ isn't it
right
are you going to put those away now
put the handle back on the
the head back on the brush darling
no
put the head back on Thomas
before you put it away
because when we wanna use it again especially in a hurry
it won't be ready „ will it
no
you'll hafta do it before it's hooked up Thomas
no
it's going to fall off again
come on let's do it properly
come on
Thomas don't it's been useta brush floors
do you know what these little rough bits are for there
if you needta scrape the brush for any reason
if you needta give the brush a quick clean
you rub it along there
that's what they're for
right
you're puffed out
right
are you going to park your breakdown truck
or whatever you were calling it today
what was it a delivery truck
I can't remember
what was it Thomas
did you not
why don't you stand the lego tractor and trailer in the back
and then that's tidied it all up
well thank you
what about this purple sunflower
don't be silly
pop it up there please
Thomas put it up there
oh yes you're looking at one of your photographs
two Georgias
I only know one
who are the other two Georgias
Kelly and Minelly
Georgia Kelly and Georgia Minelly

I've never heard of those little girls I must admit
did they come to your party
did they come to your party
I can't remember seeing them there I must admit Thomas
sounds a bit
is that a book
that you've been reading
what
don't sit on there please
Thomas
don't
well there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with your bottom
at the moment the way you're leaping around
well at least they're clean „ aren't they
the shoe people
oh yes that's fun „ isn't it
right
you want me to start at the beginning
I think we'd be better in a
different chair „ don't you
the shoe people have a noisy day in shoe town
it says a noisy day in shoe town
musical mayhem is trampling Sergeant Major
fight the battle of the bands
Sergeant Major was patrolling his garden
to make sure that everything was straight
he didn't like anything that wasn't
straight square or even
he would often do a round on his hands
and knees measuring the height of the grass
and snipping off any blades that were too high
one day a butterfly landed on one of
Sergeant Major's daffodils and made the
stem bend a little
shoo butterfly said Sergeant Major loudly
Sergeant Major always spoke very loudly
because he'd been in the army so long
stop bending my flower
he ordered

the butterfly fluttered off to Trampy's garden
where he wouldn't be disturbed
in Trampy's garden nothing was straight
square or even
flowers and bushes grew just how they wanted to
the grass was never cut
it was a very relaxed sort of garden
fence
there were no plants hanging over the fence
between Sergeant Major and Trampy's garden
Sergeant Major was always on the look out for
any untidiness coming from Trampy's side of the fence
Sergeant Major was very pleased to see all
the tidiness and started
to march around the lawn
hup two three four hup two three four
head held high arms straight
a perfect example of a military man
Sergeant Major hummed a rousing march
as he strode along
his arms swinging

he hummed marching along cheerfully
but then his concentration was broken
by a strange sound coming from Trampy's garden
a strange soft whistling sound
Sergeant Major marched to the fence
what's that din he bellowed
Trampy
what is that racket you're making
Trampy was sitting in an old deck chair relaxing
he was holding a long thin musical instrument
he held it up for Sergeant Major to see
it's a penny whistle he said
a what
bellowed Sergeant Major a look of amazement on his face
a penny whistle
replied the relaxed Trampy listen
he put the whistle to his lips
and played a little tune
that was like a wind
like the wind tinkling through a crystal chandelier
that's horrible that is said Sergeant Major
can't you play any proper music like a good march
Trampy stopped playing and looked at Sergeant Major
I don't like marches he said
Sergeant Major was speechless
for about three seconds
you don't like marches he bellowed
in a voice that was even louder than before
well we'll see about that
he did a smart about turn and marched into Drill hall
his house
and Trampy carried on playing
oh is that a snail
Trampy carried on playing
three butterflies fluttered by in time to the music
and a snail did a very smooth
and slipperly sliding slow step

in Drill hall
oh
just a minute we needta stop the tape Thomas
just one moment I'd forgotten
