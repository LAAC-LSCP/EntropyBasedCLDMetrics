well our dustbin lorry's a little bit different to the one we see on Friday „ isn't it
because we still have bin bags round here
so the dustbin men throw all of the dustbin bags into the back of the lorry „ don't they
and then when it looks fairly full they press a button and it goes
and it crushes all the bags and pushes them right into the machine
so that when they drive along the road they've got room for the next lot of bags
but when we go into Didsbury on a Friday
say we're going to bangadrumtime
then we see the red dustbin lorry „ don't we
I'm just checking this microphone Thomas

oh I'm sorry about that
who said that to you
oh
it's the postman outside
who said that to you
that you're spoiling their holiday
MissesPlattford
at nursery
well I don't understand that
because when you're at nursery you're not on holiday „ are you

just sitting still
where do you think the man as gone
he's probably delivering something to somebody somewhere
oh right
oh he as been to Steven's house „ hasn't he

so I don't think the van would've found anybody at home
they'll hafta come back later
we'll hafta keep watching
oh
gosh that's a big parcel

it looks like a roll of carpet „ doesn't it
I don't think we've ordered any carpet Thomas
don't think it's really a carpet
more like a rug „ wasn't it
a mat
that's right
to wipe your feet on
he as driven past
right
he as gone
what's the matter
why are you pulling a face
did you
did you want him to bring a parcel to you from his van

I beg your pardon
I can't tell what you saying
I I can't even remember you crying
why did you cry
you want a parcel for the TNT lorry
I can't remember you crying at all about anything Thomas yesterday
you were a very good boy actually
I think you cried more when you were smaller because
before you learned to talk properly you'd get very frustrated when you were trying to tell me things
when you were trying to ask for things
and tell me what you wanted
Mummy couldn't understand because you weren't talking
and that's when you useta get a bit frustrated and you useta cry
and now you can say Mummy please may I have
or Mummy I want
or Mummy look at this
and I know what you're wanting now

I don't think a vet would have pulled onto our drive just to check his car Thomas

I think he might be going to see Fred and Rachel next door
I think he as just parked his car here by mistake
cause he as not come to our house „ has he

I'll wash the strawberries

whoops

I'll just get a little bowl to put those in
and then
we can eat them
yes
I'm just wondering what's happening at Sue's house
look there's
it looks like somebody as done something to the gate
it's all propped up
oh I know what it will be
Sue next door is having some work done in her garden
and they probably just leaned some of the fence posts up against Sue's house
and there we are poppet
oh no they're not
she was only joking about that Thomas
no
no they're having
do you remember when Roy the builder dug a really big hole in our front garden and put some drains in
to stop the path flooding
you were only very young at the time but you useta look forward to him coming every day
he hadta dig really deep into the garden to put the drains on
and that's what Sue's having done over the road
Susan
they're digging up all her back garden to put some land drains in
and it looks like a big hole
and because it as rained it's full of water
and she was only joking when she said she was making a swimming pool
she's not really Thomas
they're going to fill all the earth back in
and then put the paving flags back down on top of them
pardon
and grass
yes
well they put paving slabs and grass
she'll put the paving stones back on the patio
because we went to see her last night „ didn't we
she's nice „ isn't she
yes
well I'm sure they've got all sorts of equipment coming
and Sue said you must come in again for a drink „ didn't she
to you
she wants you to go and have a drink with her „ doesn't she
mhm
well if you go I'll probably go as well
but Susan who we saw last night was Sue's friend „ wasn't she
and we useta know her just to say hello to her and wave and have a quick chat about the dog and about you
but since Sue as died we've got to know here very well „ haven't we
she's nice
those strawberry's good Thomas
well what do you say
yes please Mum
very big one there
shall we do that one
do that one
and this one
which one
this one
where
this one
is that the one you meant
we'll do one more than
oops
oh dear
where as it gone

lost it
can't see it Tom
I ad better find it because if we stand on a strawberry
oh it's under your chair
it'll make a really big soggy mess „ won't it
hello
hello strawberry
we found you
right
I'll wash these
I tend to just put them to drain a few minutes on that kitchen paper look
ah wait
no pinching strawberries
I saw you
I know I've taken my glass off to wipe them but I can still see
oy
cheeky
right
no strawberries now for Thomas
I think I'll eat all these
I don't think so
you mustn't eat to many because they make your tummy a bit upset „ don't they
eat them slowly
well it doesn't matter how quickly or slowly you eat them
if you've had too many then
your tummy will be sore
ah
right
okay
you have those and I'll have these two
how's that
don't eat them too quickly though Thomas because they will
do you remember that day you ate them very quickly
what happened
you felt sick „ didn't you
well that was silly
mm
these are nice „ aren't they
lovely strawberries from Scotland
no
not when you've had all these strawberries Thomas
it might upset your tummy
have cherries later
no
I like you eating fruit
but I don't want you to have too much
no
it doesn't matter
if your tummy as got too much fruit in it it might upset it
you've been a good boy with your potty „ haven't you
mm
they are nice
look at all the little leaves and the stalks
hm they don't really get pips
you get little seeds in strawberries
can you see on the
look
can you see on this red skin
there are all little seeds
they're not pips like you get in apples or oranges „ are they
every strawberry has a little pip
well lotsof little pips and seeds
you eat them
yes
but things like apples and oranges that have big pips in them you don't eat those
and some of the grapes they have pips „ don't you
and other grapes you don't
it just depends on the type
I shall put the lids back on the jam and marmalade and they can go back in the fridge
and then I think it's time
to get dressed „ don't you
no
it's not time for television Thomas yet
you watch Teletubbies and Tweenies
and the Teletubbies don't start till ten o'clock „ do they
kitchen floor looks a bit of a mess „ doesn't it
I think it's some of Purdie's food that has got on the floor
you wanna get down
just a second
did
did you enjoy your strawberries Thomas
you telling Purdie she's a naughty cat
Purdie as done what
sausages
can't tell what you're saying
what's
everybody's mix it round an make into fudge

what are you talking about now
ant
sounds disgusting if you mix it with ants
do you mean ants those little crawly creepy crawlie things we saw on the pavement
if they get in they'll bite you
little ants
ants in your pants
bite your bottom
they would
if they get on your feet
we were standing yesterday talking to that gentleman
there were lotsof ants running around „ weren't there
if they ad got onto us
oh
they don't half bite
horrible little things
they're very busy ants
they're always busy building
that's why there are so many of them
you were „ weren't you
yes
you ad taken the umbrella with us
you didn't need it
it wasn't raining
but you were just bashing it around the place „ weren't you
and then when you realized you were hitting the hedge when I looked at the hedge it was covered in bees
so we hadta stop doing that because if you upset the bees they'll sting you
and bees are nice Thomas
if you upset them they'll sting you and it'll hurt
yeah
I think she's taping the window trying to get in „ isn't she
no
don't shout at Purdie
if she wants to come in she can come in
but she as got to wait a minute while I wipe your hands
well listen
bees make honey
bees collect pollen from the flowers
and they make honey
and when you enjoy honey loops for breakfast
all the honey on that cereal
has been made by buzzy bees
so you must never upset bees
because they're working very hard to make nice honey for you
and if you do upset them they'll sting you
and then you'll wish you hadn't
wasps are a bit different
wasps sting you but wasps don't make honey
they just fly around and buzz
what sort of mark
oh you dirty Bertie
come on
let's wipe your other hand please
I'll wipe your face instead then
you mop tub
shh
mop tub
mop tub „ aren't you
in a minute
I'm just going to let Purdie in again
there we are
what did you do then
what have you done
excuse me
