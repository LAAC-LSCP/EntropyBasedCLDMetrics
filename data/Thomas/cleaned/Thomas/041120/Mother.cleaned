I know it's because I've just been hoovering I've been racing round
right
now
well
yes
we're both a bit warm „ aren't we
right
don't get something else from it's lunchtime will you come and sit down
come on come and sit down please
what Purdie is she on the stairs
what is she doing
looking back at you
right
sit down please love
no
you've got to have something even if it's very little
the trouble is we're having a late breakfast
now Luke's Mummy has asked if you wanna go round to Luke's
and I said we would well you would
so
you must have a bite to eat because if you have tea at Luke's
what happened
oh did I with my thumbnail
I'm sorry love
do you know when I was lifting you
well I wasn't lifting I was helping you into your chair I thought I felt something
but you don't know what time Luke's Mum is going to give you tea because she doesn't have tea
and honestly you don't know whether you're going to like it because you're quite fussy
so
well
well you had pizza once before but today I think it might be something like chicken nuggets
but whatever it is Thomas say thank you and try and eat some
you must eat some
of course you must
yes
and try a bit in case you like it
right
are you listening to me now
so we don't know what time you'll be eating tea and we don't know whether you'll like it when you get it so have something even if it's only a bit of apple and cheese now
cause you mustn't be hungry later on
Thomas come on we're rushing now if you're going to Luke's you must hurry and tell me what you want
yes
but what
an apple
and would you like a piece of cheese with that
would you like some bread with that
do you want toast
apple and cheese
what about some quavers

yes
you can
now please
you don't want honey loops
hula hoops
now listen because we're rushing
I don't want you to rush and spoil your meal I want you to enjoy your meal but don't mess about at the table and make lotsof crumbs
no
I know you're alright but
and then what we'll hafta do is we'll hafta perhaps do some taping later on when you come home
because it's a shame if somebody's asked you out and you can't go
well try your very best
here you are
there's some nice cheese
we did actually have quite a good breakfast „ didn't we when we had breakfast
a cheese house
we can talk about cheese houses
with me
oh that's
I must say I don't know what to have on see if we've got some crackers
it would be lovely that but we haven't got prawn crackers
crackers like Ryvitas love
probably would you like a piece of this bread
here you are what about a drink
would you like a drink
Thomas would you like a drink
you're not saying mm if you say mm you don't get anything
well I'm sitting down in a minute

I've dropped the box of tapes
I've broken the box when I dropped it you know
when you went down then did you see any of the box
you did
then obviously that's what I've done in that case
dropped it and broke it which isn't very helpful „ is it

sorry
well I did want it really
yes
because it's the box we keep the tapes in
whereabouts did you see it Thomas
did you really see it or not
whereabouts
oh it's here
Thomas don't fib come on I haven't time
listen if you wanna go to Luke's we've got to rush and we've other things we've got to do before we go out
well don't tease today Thomas „ will you we haven't got time „ have we
you're a right little tease „ aren't you
you're a right little tease

now what did I say
right
sit up
put your knees in front of you
no
messing today
yes
you can
are they good now you've got them
„ did we
hula hoops
I can just think of HoneynutLoops
your eyes you look so tired today
are you not feeling so good
you are feeling good really
I feel very warm very hot
Luke's house
I don't think he's got a new house „ do you
that's a new one on me
I said that's a new one on me
he lives in a new house
I don't think so I think we shall be going to the new house
pardon
I don't know what you mean love
look
put it this way
I only walked past Luke's house two days ago
he still lived there
there was no sign of the house being up for sale
he never mentioned anything and his Mummy's phoned today saying would Thomas like to come round
and she didn't say oh and by the way we've moved

so I would imagine
well he was telling fibs
Thomas
you do know quite a few people ah
the cover for the box is still there it's still in the box look
silly Mum
you won't ever touch these tapes „ will you darling
well because they're all labelled and ready for collection
well we collect them until Jeannine comes then hand them over
I think we've got a bit muddled up with them because we've been you know some
well sometimes we go into the university „ don't we
and when we do that we don't tend to take the tapes with us
so we've got a nice little collection now „ haven't we
which they all belong to Jeannine
Jeannine needs them all
Thomas will you stop being rude
thank you that's better
when I went to the hill I didn't know what to do
thought you said there wasn't any salad in the fridge
there's two bags of salad as I can see
perhaps you didn't think it looked very fresh
what
I think it's looked better but it's certainly not off and it's well within the date
and your the dirty rascal
is that right
I don't think you're dirty yet
don't you
I was just going to say I don't think you're dirty you haven't been out to get dirty „ have you
what we'll do after lunch is brush your teeth
have a bit of a freshen up
and then off
and we'll drop to Luke's house and just hope when we get there
they've not moved

because that would be a real nuisance „ wouldn't it
yeah
Joshua's just moved „ hasn't he
I know it's right near a railway track actually Thomas
because I went the other day
and I had a nice cup of coffee with his Mummy
well not particularly while we were there but I could hear trains going dudiddleedum
and when we left the house we actually drove alongside the railway track
he's ever so near
not as near as when he was when he lived at school
because he lived down the same street as school „ didn't he
he's not that near but he's a lot closer than I thought when his Mummy
yeah
what
does he really
is that before he move
well she's moved next to Josh again
I don't think she has
it's funny actually how many dinner ladies live down that road
because it's so handy having a job near the school „ isn't it
and one or two people that go to church like Barbara and Anne are now retired but they useta be dinner ladies and they live on Popwell street
can you imagine living so close to work
and Adam's Mummy is a dinner lady „ isn't she
she doesn't live there
she has a car she hasta drive
does Adam's Mum help actually in the dining room in the hall at lunchtime or is she just in the playground afterwards
she's both places she's watching you have your lunch is she and then she's outside supervising you in the playground
mm good
good because that gate's a bit vulnerable „ isn't it right there
right
hello Purdie

you mean
for the gate
yes
oh
you told them „ did you
look it's
oh she's been home
who's who's
look how she sits on that bin bag
it's empty and it's clean that let's see what she does
she's having a little look she looks puzzled
what's the matter

there we are she's sat down I knew she would
you could tell couldn't you that she was settling down
poor old Purdie
come and eat up Thomas please come on
no
come on you must eat some have some fruit you haven't eaten any apple yet
well try some
Thomas
no
turn put your legs down turn round and eat over your plate
mm
well that's alright
you just eat what you need please
no
I think she's alright
right
I'm going to take a piece of this apple is that alright

well she perhaps wants to go out again
I can hear her now crying can you
mm
yes
but that's not a police helicopter Thomas
they don't
well we do get the police helicopters around here „ don't we but I don't think that is that's just a plane droning on
well presumably if someone's done something naughty and they're looking for somebody and I think once there was quite a bad accident and the police helicopter just stayed above shining a light for them
because it was night time and then the people working on the ground could see what they were doing
and we live very near to HeatonMersey common and I think sometimes when people have broken into homes they dump things on the common they drop bags and then run away „ don't they
and the police helicopter can see places that police cars can't drive to
so that's quite lucky
oh
yeah
I think they'd know if a police helicopter was chasing them there isn't really a lot of places they can hide from the helicopter
it's a big eye in the sky watching them


good
because I didn't really steal it I said oh may I have a piece of this apple Thomas and as I took it from your plate
I told you I was doing it
and also you said you didn't really want a lot
come on eat up please otherwise it'll be too late to go
mm

Louise or Louisa
the lady who plays the organ with the dog is called Louise
what are you doing
are you going to the toilet
okay
yes
it's a newspaper „ isn't it a picture of somebody with three babies
oh there's Purdie crying
she might wanna go out what's the matter puss
bye bye
what's the matter
it could right we're in the conservatory with the train set „ aren't we
and somebody else is with us
look there you can see
on the map
you're not going to tell me what happened when you went to Luke's house Thomas
but you had a nice time „ didn't you
and what did his Mummy give you to eat because you really seemed to enjoy that
green pasta and plain pasta
chips and tomato sauce
I thought there was some meat you told me
what was it
green pasta and what pasta
oh plain pasta
yes
and chips
you're playing now with your telephone „ aren't you
it made me laugh when we got to Luke's cause as we walked up the hill
he was there with his little hat on „ wasn't he
pardon
did you think it was Grace's hat Grace is his sister „ isn't she
well I just heard him he looked really excited because I think they'd just arrived home „ don't you and he was getting out of the car
and you shouted
he shouted Tom
and you said oh Luke I like that nice summer hat
he was using a walkietalkie or something „ wasn't he
Yorkie talkie or walkietalkie
oh
right
you're using your toy mobile phone to make the sounds of a vehicle reversing
and you're backing up the
what truck is that
a skip lorry
well that's a very good sound
oh sounds a bit more like a mobile phone now

we've got a train track in here and you've got all sorts of diggers and dumpers and builders equipment „ haven't we
so what are you going to do
building what we did before
so you're repairing a crack in the track oh that rhymes
Henry cracking and racketytrickety ricketytrickety track

repairing a crack in the rickety track
rickety trickety clicketyclack
so I've got to pretend I'm backing you out „ have I
it's alright well I'll keep going come on back up
right
woah stop now stop
okay
off you go you should get round now Mr builder
or whoever you are the skip lorry are you a dustbin man
oh are you
and what are you picking up today
right
you're picking up wood and trees and there seems to be a fire engine and a cat lying on its side
is that BobTheBuilder's ship
oh I see oh so it's not a real pussy cat
it's just a model that somebody didn't want
well I imagine there are a lot of children would like a model of BobTheBuilder's pussy cat
did she and she couldn't find anybody
what about Miles next door he likes BobTheBuilder
oh well we could always keep it for him „ couldn't we
right
well if it's only a model cat it won't need cat food will it
think a model cat needed cat food „ does it
I don't understand why would be painting a tin of cat food
so it's a trick
so really you'd get a
would this be a full tin of cat food or an empty tin
a full tin of cat food and you sound like you're going to put glue round it
and put it next to and when people try and pick the two up

they can't really cause it's stuck
yes
oh dear
you know something when Mummy and Daddy useta work and this is going back many years now
telling you a story
you know the payphone the telephone the telephone kiosk
and it was inside somebody had glued a ten pence piece you know a silver coin
to the ground
and I must admit the first time I saw it I thought oh somebody had dropped ten pee and I tried to pick it up and I couldn't because it was glued to the ground
and the number of people I useta see going to pick up that ten pee
every time they tried they couldn't do it because someone had glued it to the ground it was quite funny really
it was quite annoying really because you thought oh great I've found ten pee but there was no way you could lift it up
oh well
okay
I bet it's full of
is that a real fire engine or a broken fire engine
a model fire engine

oh is it
right
okay
yes
keep coming I'll back you
can you see my hands
keep keep keep coming woah
does that remind you of anything
when you and Daddy dropped me off at work the other night
well what happened
well Daddy was having a job to see and I was going right keep keep keep coming
did you know see me reversing him round helping and guiding him
I'm guiding you I am
oh stop you're going to hit the train track
there's a lot of rubbish around this place „ isn't there
did you enjoy that chocolate lollipop you had at Marks and Spencers the other day
do you know what reminded me of the lollipop
what am I building
oh again
that's all I seem to do here
oh I can see a major repair that needs to be done
look at the track over there
dear
look there's two bits of that track that's broken
well how am I going to mend it
do I need some equipment
well I don't think that's how people mend proper railway tracks „ do they
oh I see
is this a model railway or is this a real railway
oh I see everything is a model model size is it
a little bit like lego land
is it lego land
you needta be guided do you
right
keep keep keep keep reversing stop how's that
wow it's the head of somebody
right
it looked like an orange
right
now you've reversed what are you going to do
you like those little noises „ don't you
the trouble is you're not saying an awful lot Thomas you're leaving me to do all the talking
oh is it I thought that was the reversing one
I suppose you could have
is it
really
right
oops a daisy there's a little baby
what was your favorite part of lego land
the toilet
that was funny because Daddy went into the toilet you didn't wanna go
Daddy went to the gents' toilets and he came out and he said that when he shut the toilet door there was a lot of laughing and rude noises and he thought that's strange
and then he realized it was coming from this cubicle and then I went to the ladies and in the ladies when I closed the door I heard the sound of somebody going
ooh la la la la
scrubbing their back like they were they were sposta be having a bath in the bath scrubbing their back in the bath and then you heard a toilet flush and a lady say come on wash your hands
so when Mummy and Daddy came out and told you about all the exciting news you suddenly decided that you wanted to go to the toilet and the rest of the visit you wanted to go to the toilet all the time
but the boys toilet must have been much ruder than the girls because the girls were nice and civilized and polite
yes

when you opened it she closed the toilet door it sounded like someone was whistling and using the toilet
then the toilet doors looked like lego in the ladies did they look like that in the boys toilets
because everywhere
Thomas said it was lego blue like lego bricks „ wasn't it

well now I just needta take my glasses off hold on
let me put me safety goggles on for the building site
right
back back up oh woah there's lotsof rubbish on the ground
I think you need the dustbin lorry to pick up all these bits of rubbers
broken bits of rubbers
and
yes
you can go
I like the dungeon Thomas not the dungeon the castle
yes
and you got a sword „ didn't you
and
I know somebody else who went to lego land who's that
Luke
well I'll tell you who else was there as well you know Lou's sister's children those two boys what are they called Rory and Connor
oh Thomas don't do that to Purdie
well luckily she can't hear you but that's not fair
don't
Rory and Conner went as well and they liked it „ didn't they
and do you remember that room where you were playing with all the building bricks they were like lego but they were rubber bricks „ weren't they

well I don't think
Thomas stop making such a lot of noise please
I don't think you're a police man you're a skip driver
arrest me
yes
I could be a police man
stop it please
right
back
right
back
woah stop
right
are you just bringing one brick now
no
don't Thomas that's annoying turn it off
mm

Thomas away from Purdie please
she's having a little snooze really she's eaten loads of
okay
let's put your neenahs on
let's back
okay
come come come on woah stop
you could the skip then „ couldn't you
pardon make
don't please you're making too much noise
I don't know what you mean
a ramp it looked like a wigwam when you had it stood up like that
or a tea
for
make a tea for a
it's a cross
oh hot cross bun

that's a little piece it's a bun and you've made cross



we could
what did we make we made a song up once do you remember when we thought we'd bought hot cross buns and when we got them home they were just tea cakes without crosses
they weren't hot cross buns „ were they
that's
right
hot cross hot cross I am very cross my hot cross bun has got no cross
was that
I am very cross my hot cross bun has got no cross
do you remember that
mm
you've got a crane here then „ have you
I don't think we really need a train track „ do you
okay
where are you coming Mr crane
oh are you coming here
I will keep coming oh that's a funny noise keep coming
right
you'd better stop or you're going to hit the mixer
remember before when I asked you if you'd enjoyed your lollipop from Marks and Spencers
it was this that reminded me it looks like the lolly stick that you had in Marks and Spencers I think this is actually off a flag „ isn't it
so is there anything you could hook
oh I know what you can hook
a ladder from the fire engine look
with that
yes
that's a good thing to hook
what could you pretend that was
a barrel
a barrel of beer
that's your very tiny kaleidoscope „ isn't it
it's only about the size of my thumb
I think it's different sort of thing with this though because it doesn't really look a pattern it's sort of whatever you want it to
it distorts the shape of that thing you see
it's alright just be gentle or else you'll end up breaking the hook
that's it gently ease it out
what's that
right
if look at Purdie with it
it makes lots and lotsof little Purdies „ doesn't it
it's rather nice
did Lynn give you that
don't be silly
I will
let me just have a little look
oh goodness me
what a lot of cranes it looks like they're doing a dance look at that
yes
if you just look at it straight and you see lotsof cranes now twirl it round
it looks like they're doing a dance „ doesn't it
it's a lovely little kaleidoscope
yes
no
mm
and you always wanted a lot of toys
oh my goodness
and then you can look at this and pretend you've got hundreds of toys
then I've got so many cats

I've got so many pussy cats
and she's asleep near your blue Wellingtons and I've got lots and lotsof pairs of Wellingtons
oh and now I've got rather a lot of Thomas
oh steady oh love are you alright
never mind you'll mend
right
can I just read it
just a second
it looks as though it was made in China I wonder where it was from

mm can you see I've got my tongue out
look at the sun look there it is the sun look
can you see the shiny bit in the sky
what is it your fist I can see you've
you little monkey
I'm just putting it on the sun to see
the sun isn't really very bright but oh wow
it reminds me of when you're in an aeroplane seeing somewhere
do you
can you see sunflowers
oh
yes
right
yes
I like a lot of Purdie that's nice
look what a juicy grin
and a big tum you cheeky monkey
Thomas
no
this is the simplest
what are you doing
it's the simplest thing
my hair's blue why my hair's blue
oh because I'm sitting on a blue pillow probably
what did you have a play with at Luke's house
you didn't play the kaleidoscope
get get down

was it
it wasn't a mini one
get this from the we've had this a long time
so did you play with Luke's walkietalkie toys
oh my gosh
mm you can see ThomasTheTankEngine
yes
I'm going to go and get little Purdie

Thomas

excuse me don't say that please
Thomas
shh
swings and slides
oh we can suddenly hear Linda talking „ can't
hush Thomas stop it
I think she's obviously talking to someone on her mobile phone „ isn't she
this is funny Thomas just twirl this round at the light switch in the dolphin
and it looks like there's lotsof swirly dolphins can you see it
yes
I know it looks strange „ doesn't it
well it's
could you
are you
could you answer me this did you play with Luke's walkietalkie at all
yes
are you going to tell me about Luke's
was Grace
no
well was Luke's brother there

build
you mean build
what I wasn't a builder a few minutes ago I was reversing
I was a parking attendant

I see
so I'm a general assistant „ am I
right
I've builded that
oh I should have said built rather than builded
I built that and I've built it
there we are I think I need a pay rise for being such a good builder
oh Thomas don't do that
no
I think we'd better just this because
no
Linda
no
you won't Linda's talking outside and that's rude
no
don't don't touch that please
no
I hope that's not where your are
there was an explosion
what's the explosion
oh Thomas it makes too much noise
no
Thomas please if you do that I'm stopping playing
you're playing with your train set now and it's quite late and it's very nearly bedtime
we've had a busy day today „ haven't we
I stopped the tape then because
whilst Linda was talking on her mobile phone
I would say I think we could hear the conversation and it's a bit rude to sit and listen so I thought we'd better turn the tape off and have a few minutes break
and I've come back and you're now playing with your train set are you
yes
he's the
well I did
just be careful though Thomas because when you bang things down on this wooden floor we can't hear what you're saying
watch
no
Thomas

can you not have a quiet explosion
can you not have a quiet explosion
nobody else has a quiet explosion
if there's a big explosion there's a big bang „ isn't there
but how come you've had an explosion what's happened
I know
the builder was having a quiet lunch and then that happened
and what was that
what's happened
yes
you've nearly worn holes in your socks have you been outside a lot in your socks
they're not too small for you „ are they
cause those socks
don't stop Thomas don't
there's a if you start putting things back
you're going to make it a bigger hole
no
those socks I think are size eight to twelve shoe size
ohgosh
yes
what's in this engine shed

what's in the engine shed
ah a little blue train look at the engine
a little blue engine
what were we saying before all that Thomas
I've forgotten
we were talking about explosions
yes
but before we were talking about shoe sizes
yes
because you've got but you're not a size twelve really yet „ are you
yeah
oh dear
but Thomas would we know there was going to be an explosion I think they just happen „ don't they
something explodes and you can't sort of plan when it's going to happen
the only time I would imagine this
do you remember when we saw a something on the television quite a while ago about some buildings being demolished
and they had a huge
a bit like your toy crane but instead of a hook it had a massive ball on the end of a chain
and the banged this big ball into the building
and the building started to fall down

oh
yeah
yeah
but that's what I mean most explosions are caused by things that blow up or crashes not planned things
only certain things I would imagine are planned
round the track you tripped round the track
he tricked around the track what do you mean
oh
Thomas please will you stop now you're going to break it
no
I'm not watching anymore
no
because you're going to break it
you're too rough you don't do that
no
no
no
I'm not playing
no
I'm not playing
no
no
I would like to see a tree
no
they come along and saw them down to make wood
I don't
right
but usually if a tree's struck by lightning it just kills it and it wouldn't fall over quite like that
and the wood's fallen as well presumably was that a fence around the forest
well if the trees all fell down quickly they were probably knocked
the fence round the forest ground did it
oh that would be terrible if I was walking near the fence and that came crashing down
I'm walking in the jungle
no
don't love
oh I think I'd be terribly frightened if I saw a house and trees a train a mixer a digger and a man and fence
all lying there I'd be very frightened and wanna go home
is there a train running on this track
right
could I get in it please and go home I don't like this anymore
I'm frightened and I wanna get home to my little boy
and my pussy cat and my husband
who's watching oh look at that Purdie's boyfriend
aw and she's asleep and she's no idea
he is actually a beautiful cat Thomas „ isn't he
he doesn't look quite as fluffy as he did
he feels safe up there he's on Fred and Rachel's shed roof „ isn't he looking down
yeah
I wonder if he's noticed Purdie

I don't think he's even noticed Purdie „ do you
you see that shed's quite nice Purdie useta sit up there I haven't seen her up there now for a few days
but it's quite nice cause you can get to it easily by jumping on our table and then on the fence and then on the shed roof
what have you got in those green bins
you've got toys in one
one's full of things like your football and your lawnmower and your croquet set
things like that
and the other one do you know what's inside the other one
no
it's not rubbish the black bin around the corner has rubbish in for the bin men
no
the green one has newspapers for recycling and junk mail
Daddy's here now
have you seen Purdie's boyfriend up there
what did you bang yourself on
oh dear on the door
oh dear
right
Purdie's woken up now did you wake her up

I think she has actually
I think she has
because she looked like she had when she looked up before
it's a book called Freddy and Froy but it's quite a long
I can love
there's one where Lucy and Tom go to school
Lucy and Tom go to school
right
what are you doing
this is for your fire fighters equipment „ isn't it
is it your breathing apparatus

well you've got a bit tangled up with it „ haven't you
yes
I don't mind the chuff of the train but I don't want lotsof banging and clattering
that was NanaFielden on the phone
because
well it's not my Grandad it's my Daddy your Grandad
your Grandad is
well he was there and I spoke to him very briefly and he's to have a radio talk
that's why he was on the phone this morning don't you know he's on the radio sometimes
Grandad is on the radio and the television sometimes
yes
he's going to speak for quarter of an hour on something
I don't know we've got to listen to it tomorrow morning
well now it's on BBC four radio four you know the station when we listen to the Archers on
it's on that channel in the morning
so we've got some tapes here in the bottom drawer
I'll hafta make sure I've got a brand new tape
and set the tape recorder going
you will actually be here in the morning at that time
yes
your Grandad and GrandmaWatt were both on the television a few years ago
the that Nana grew up in
was on the television it showed the post man driving down the lane to deliver some letters and Nana was cooking a meal
and they interviewed Grandad
but
while they were going to interview Grandad they filmed the post man delivering post and they filmed Nana in the kitchen
and since then Grandad's been on the radio quite a few times
but not for quite a few because he's had a stroke now
he can't talk like he useta

to be careful of the river
oh my goodness

so we hafta change direction and go over the bridge
oh dear
we're having great problems with this track „ aren't we
tracks and explosions and trees falling down
a dangerous moment

no
I don't like dangerous roads
no
I could do without them Thomas

goodness me
maybe
