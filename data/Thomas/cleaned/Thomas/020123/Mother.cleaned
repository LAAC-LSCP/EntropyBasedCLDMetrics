Mummy's tummy feels full now
does Thomas's tummy feel full
we read that story last night about the caterpillar whose tummy was full
do you remember
mm that's right
it was about a little egg on a leaf and when the sun came up in the morning
that's right
out of the egg popped a caterpillar
he was tiny and very hungry „ wasn't he
and he ate through a lot of food in a week „ didn't he
I think it was apples pears strawberries oranges plums I can't remember the other thing I think it was plums
and then on Saturday he had an absolutely enormous feast
he had a piece of chocolate cake and an icecream cone a slice of salami piece of Swiss cheese
what else did he have
I can't remember
a cup cake a slice of watermelon
can't think what else he had
a slice of salami
and he was very very full and he had eaten so much he had a tummyache „ didn't he
and the next day was Sunday and he ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better
and then he built a cocoon around himself „ do you remember that picture
when the tiny green caterpillar had grown into a big fat green caterpillar when he'd eaten a lot of food on the Saturday night
and then he built a cocoon around himself
that was the picture with all the brown circles and he stayed inside for more than two weeks and then what happened
pop
he popped again
he popped out of the cocoon and he was beautiful butterfly „ wasn't he
you want me to say it again
well it's not as easy saying it again without the book Thomas
because I can't remember half the things
but it's about a very tiny hungry caterpillar
who eats a lot of things
more pop
oh you mean toast
I thought you meant more pop you wanted me to tell you the story again about the caterpillar poping out the cocoon
