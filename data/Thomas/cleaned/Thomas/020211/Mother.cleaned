if you were going fishing you'd either need a hot drink or a cold drink „ wouldn't you
in the flask
there's no juice in there „ is there
what else would you take in the basket with all the fishing things
you could take a net
this is a net
a fishing net
and you could take this
this is a fishing rod
and this on the side can you see it winding
winding
that's the reel
it's like a wheel
reel
Uncle David goes fishing a lot „ doesn't he

put them in the water
look
yes
are you winding the reel
yes
you're fishing on the floor Thomas
how about we attach this hook to the fishing rod and see if we can catch some fish
catch fish
when you go fishing you have a hook on the end of the line
but the fish in the sea don't have a little loop on the back like these do
we're cheating a bit „ aren't we
it's easier to catch these fish
oh has the reel gone in the water
the fishing rod
look how this extends
it can be a very long fishing rod
you caught a fish
let's put it in the basket

picking it up with your hands
picking it up with one hand and putting the hook in with the other
