lifting that up

the blue van
there's a man walking
he as gone now
would you like to go and get your tractor and farm animals and we'll have a look and see what's happening on the farm today
that's right
a tractor
what color are the tractor wheels Thomas
yellow
there's the dog
there's the cow
moo
and what's this
pig
what's the pig's name
and what's this
the sheep
what does the sheep say
baabaa
the sheep's wool made your jumper
you're wearing a woolly jumper „ aren't you
and that's the farmer
where's the farmer's shoes
they're probably Wellingtons
where's the farmer's Wellingtons
and he as got trousers
and a jacket
and a shirt
and a hat
he's wearing a hat
there's his jacket
and his shirt
and his trousers
and he as got green Wellingtons on
Mummy as got Wellingtons but her's are black
Thomas has Wellingtons and they're blue with the Teletubbies on them
are you tired
that's the tractor
are you pushing the tractor
what's this Thomas
does the bus go for a ride in the tractor
there's the farmer
can he drive
he can drive
and the cow
and the pig
oinkoink
and the dog
and there's the sheep
all done
is the tractor full now
what else is there room for
some apples
what about poping some apples and some eggs in the tractor because they come from the farm „ don't they
and the hens on the farm lay eggs
so you might like to put some eggs on the tractor
a lot of farms have orchards with apple trees
so we can put some green apples and a red apple
yes some pears might grow in the orchard
yes
would you like the tune
that's OldMacDonaldhadafarm
and look
a bottle of milk because the milk comes from the cow
so we've got eggs apples pears and milk
but I think the oranges the pineapples and the lemons and the grapes grow in a hotter country
and they could come by train
yes an orange so it's very possible that ThomasTheTankEngine and his trailer
he could have oranges and grapes and bananas and lemons because he's bringing them from hot country
shall we put bananas and lemons and oranges and grapes and pineapple into Thomas's carriages
are you pushing Thomas
yes
right our hour must be up Thomas because the tape's switched off
I don't know what that was but it was a click that sounded like a tape
but we haven't got a tape
we could have a helicopter as well
an aeroplane and a I think it's highly likely that the apples rather than orange and the lemon and the pineapple they will be flown in a helicopter or an aeroplane
oh that's noisy

is that the helicopter
in your ThomasTheTankEngine books what is the helicopter called
mummum that's what you say but what's it called
Harold
is he called Harold
HaroldtheHelicopter
he flies in the sky
watch the helicopter
is Thomas playing with is train
what does the train say
choochoo
that's the blue van it has driven away and we've missed it
the blue van has gone
all gone
Mummy's going to wind the helicopter up with a key
a key
oh dear
pop the key in there
and turn the key
and oh it as crashed
the helicopter
are you putting the key
putting the key in the helicopter and turn it
that's nice and bright „ isn't it
what has happened
the propeller has fallen off
they're blue „ aren't they
the helicopter's red blue yellow and green
and the propellers are blue and they go round and round
like the wheels on the bus the propellers go round and round
it keeps falling off „ doesn't it
I think it's nearly time for lunch
what would you like to eat
there's a little bit of chicken and a bake from last night
you don't fancy that
and you'll probably like some fruit
what fruit would you like
grapes
and banana and pears
and an apple

chocchoc
I don't think so
I don't think so
that's your truck

yes
yes but you've got to sit in this chair darling
I know you like sitting in the other chair
