is that what she said
you were riding around a lot on that bicycle „ weren't you
and the tractor
do you remember the tractor and trailer you were playing with
because that little boy was really cheeky „ wasn't he
because you were riding around with the tractor and trailer and he pulled the trailer off
so you stopped and you got off the tractor to go and put the trailer back on the back
and he jumped on the tractor and drove off „ didn't he

not a lamp a ramp
you were driving the cars up to the top of the ramp
that's right
this is a lamp
and you were getting them to top and then letting them fall down „ weren't you
I think Isabelle's having a garage for Christmas from her Grandma
because they didn't know what to buy her
and she's fascinated with garages and cars
so I think that's what she's going to get to play with at Christmas
no carriage
has the carriage just fallen on the floor

this is called the very hungry caterpillar
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf
where's the egg
and what's this
a big moon
and can you see the face
that's called the man in the moon
what can you see

but can you see the face in the moon
what as he got
two eyes a nose and a mouth
oh it's not dark anymore „ is it
now we've turned over the page
it's sunny now
one Sunday morning the warm sun came up
and pop
out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar
he started to look for some food
on Monday he ate through one apple
but he was still hungry
on Tuesday he ate through two pears
but he was still hungry
on Wednesday he ate through three plums
but he was still hungry
on Thursday he ate through one two three
four strawberries
but he was still hungry
can you see all the holes in the fruit where he as walked through them
he as bitten them
eaten through them
on Friday he ate through one two three four
five oranges
but he was still hungry
ohgosh
this looks like a big feast
on Saturday he ate through a piece of chocolate cake
one ice cream cone
one pickle
one slice of swiss cheese
one slice of salami
one lolly pop
one piece of cherry pie
one sausage
one cupcake
and one slice of watermelon
oh
and that night he had
a tummy ache
I'm not surprised
look how many things he as eaten
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten things he as eaten Thomas
he as eaten through

chocolate cake
ice cream cone
one pickle
one cheese
one slice of swiss cheese
no
that's not a lolly pop
that's like a sausage
it's salami
you slice it up
it's a slice of salami
no
that's not marmalade
that's
you said it before
on a stick
I'd like a
a lolly pop
what's that
it's a cake
it's like a cake
it's a piece of cherry pie
it's made with pastry
and it as got cherries inside
oh what's that
a sausage
you know what a sausage is when you see one
like a sausage Purdie
oh here she is
yes
I didn't know Purdie ad come down the stairs
are you giving Purdie a sausage from the book
oh she says thank you very much
she as enjoyed that
she did enjoy it Thomas
yes
she said thank you very much
and what's this
have that one
oh that's a piece of salami
oh Purdie as walked away now Thomas
she's going in the kitchen for something to eat probably
let's just look at this while she's eating
what's this
no
that's
a cake
in a little paper case
a cupcake
they're calling it
and this is a slice of
melon
so let's have a look
on Sunday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake
one ice cream cone
one pickle
one slice of swiss cheese
one slice of salami
one lolly pop
one piece of cherry pie
one sausage
one cupcake
and one slice of watermelon
and that night he had
a tummy ache
I'm not surprised
the next day was Sunday again
and the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf
look how many holes are in the green leaf
one two three four five
and after that he felt much better
now he wasn't hungry anymore
and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore
he was a big fat caterpillar
are you telling Purdie
yes
he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore
what was he
a big one
do you remember at music group on Friday we talk about things that are very large and very small
and things that grow „ don't we
and we talk about the elephants
I can't remember much about the song
but the elephant is
that's right
you're doing that with your arm as if it's the trunk
he's terribly fat
and he's terribly tall
I think we might see he's terribly wide and he's terribly tall
he has no fingers
he has no toes
but goodness gracious what a
what a big nose
an elephant's nose is called a trunk
a trunk
so look at this caterpillar
oh shall we look at the front of the book
there he was
look
oh
look at that
he was a very hungry caterpillar
he started as a little egg
and out of the egg popped this tiny little thing
and he as eaten all this food
and suddenly he's a big fat caterpillar
right
shall we read the story
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself
he stayed inside for more than two weeks
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon
pushed his way out and
pop
he was a beautiful butterfly
so there you are
you start off with a little egg on the leaf
then it grows into a caterpillar
and it eats and eats and eats
and then he goes to sleep and then
oh Thomas
don't you dare bite me
that was very naughty
that was a naughty thing to do
why did you bite Mummy's arm
why did you bite Mummy's arm
you're not like the hungry caterpillar needing to eat
eat and bite
you don't bite Thomas
you must never bite people
you've not bitten for a long time
no
no
no
no
no
naughty boys bite
naughty boys bite
naughty boys bite and big lions and big tigers
Purdie will bite if you upset her „ won't she
but it's different animals biting
because Purdie can't talk „ can she
so if she gets upset she can't say oh Thomas don't do that you're annoying me
she just hasta go like that
but she hasn't bitten you yet „ has she
nobody as ever bitten you in your life
a big alarm
can you hear an alarm ringing
yes
I can hear
it sounds as if it's a long way away
so nobody as ever bitten you in your little life
so you should never ever bite anybody else
Ben was a little bit rough with Charlotte „ wasn't he
Charlotte's his little sister
and he was really quite rough Thomas
wasn't he
he kept smacking her and hitting her

rocking horse
this is something else Isabelle has that you play with at her house
what is it
a kitchen
yes
she has a lovely little kitchen
and you like opening the doors „ don't you
this Thomas
I've just realized this is just like the one at that big playgroup we useta go to in the summer
do you remember at FieldhamPark
do you remember that little playgroup we useta go to
it was only on for a few weeks
and we useta go and all the children
you all sat round and had toast and blackcurrant juice
do you remember that playgroup
we were sposta be starting a playgroup on Friday afternoons
and they haven't done that „ have they
oh look
I can see a man with some ladders
is it the window cleaner
he's not at our side of the road though „ is he
he's walking near Sue's house
and this kitchen is exactly the same as that playgroup Thomas
because there's a little fridge with a drinks dispenser and cupboards for all the crockery
and a dishwasher
and a cooker
and a microwave
and they had that lovely wendyhouse there „ didn't they
I ad forgotten about that
oh that little boy's wearing a helmet
I don't think it's a fire engine
he's at a workbench „ isn't he
are you tired sweetheart now
no
Thomas you're going to rip my blouse holding on to me like that
do you want a cuddle
there is a big fire engine
yes
there's a fire and rescue set
look
the little boy's wearing a helmet
oh that's called an oxygen tank
when something's on fire Thomas
like the bonfire
do you remember last friday when we watched that bonfire being lit
do you remember all the smoke
remember all the smoke that we saw coming from the trees
do you remember that
well when there's a fire there's always smoke
and if ever you find yourself anywhere near smoke you can't breath
you go
you cough a lot
and so the poor firemen who hafta go into the smoke filled places to rescue people hafta have something to breath with
and that's why they need a little oxygen mask
oh
that's interesting
are you interested by that
well does FiremanSam perhaps have one
you think he does
well that little boy is
yeah
well it's like you
because he's wearing a yellow hat yours
that's a lovely tipper truck „ isn't it
there are some lovely things „ aren't there
you've got a pink car
yes
well that's like the car that you ride around in but it's pink and white
so it's more for little girls „ isn't it
it doesn't hafta be for little girls but I think it's a barbie doll one
oh now what've we got
a digger
with a trailer
it's not a pink trailer
it's an orange and a yellow trailer
it says a ploughman's tractor and trailer
that's very nice „ isn't it
look
there are even motorbikes
look
and a policeman
and some little prams
now that's something else you useta like playing with at the playgroup
there was some little dolls in prams and you useta like pushing them round and round „ didn't you

it hadn't fallen over
you tipped it over
now put it right
come on
put the table right
and Charlotte had a beautiful doll „ didn't she
do you remember Charlotte's doll

no Thomas
if you keep tipping this table up I'm going to take it off you
it's not to climb on
it's not to throw down
where are you going
you're going to the kitchen with the table
no
I don't think that's a good idea Thomas
because if you stand on it it'll tip up
and you'll fall over
come on
let's go back through here
come on
because the window cleaner
look
you can watch the window cleaner cleaning the windows at Sue's house
look

she's eating now
and you need a change „ don't you
you going to come out
oh well
that's fair enough
I'll talk to Purdie instead
I'm sure Purdie would like to talk to me
yes
we saw Christopher „ didn't we
when we went out
we went
pardon
what are you saying
oh ThomasTheTankEngine video
yes
Christopher was telling you about his ThomasTheTankEngine video „ wasn't he
because Christopher had just come home from school when we saw him
and he was carrying a little satchel „ wasn't he

then he
and he was telling you that he as got the latest ThomasTheTankEngine video
that's what he was telling you about „ wasn't it

so AuntieMabel wrote to say thank you for a nice day and please keep the suitcase safe
and she wrote in a letter in a big brown envelope „ didn't she

have you bumped into anything
like that

no
just be careful
we're trying to do something else now
well did you do that at toddler group
where did you fall
I didn't see you fall
Isabelle and Sonia
all fall down
Sonia
Sonia was talking to Mummy
you fell over and Isabelle fell over
while Sonia
like the oranges
strawberries oranges pears
apples
potatoes
sausages
fishes
fishes swim
crocodiles
I don't think it's a shopping list anymore Thomas
because I don't think we usually go shopping for crocodiles „ do we
do we
does Sam have crocodiles on his mobile shop
does he
make oranges and chips hot
talking about FiremanSam now
oh is that what the fire engine says
beeba
well you're saying the bee bah is coming for Sonia

she as still got a bandage on it „ hasn't she
she as still got a big bandage on her leg
and she can't walk all that well still „ can she
but she's a lot better than she was
but Isabelle hasta be a really good girl „ doesn't she

what's this pay up

Purdie as just said meow „ hasn't she
sounded like you were talking about the leaves falling off
but then you've suddenly gone back to saying beeba
and talking to Purdie
so I don't understand Thomas
and what else did Christopher hafta tell you
did he tell you about his day at school
no
did he not mention his day at school
you talking about all the people who have a willie
that's a silly thing to talk about
and Mummy hasn't anyway „ has she

Purdie hasn't
don't say that about Purdie
she's lovely
she is lovely

come on
lie down
let's get you changed
and I'll go and get a clean vest
a clean nappie for you
no thank you
yes

Purdie's not wearing trousers
but then Purdie doesn't get her clothes wet „ does she
Purdie has a fur coat
and she doesn't get that dirty „ does she
I don't like the look of that
did you perhaps fall off a tricycle or a bike or a tractor or something
a tractor
you just walked into something
what did you walk into

what did you smash into
the glass
not stand up
ow
I'm sure if it ad been that bad I would have heard about it
well earlier on you did fall against the table „ didn't you
you were sort of doing something at your chair and you fell over
but I didn't think you ad really hurt yourself
ow
is that what you said when you fell
did you
you didn't come and tell Mummy about it „ did you
did you

don't lick your knee
you're watching Purdie
yes
that's right
she as run away again
you've got a big tummy
you're making a lot of noise „ aren't you
oh now you've hit your head on the lampshade
ah but that was your own fault
because you swung the lampshade „ didn't you
so when it came back it as bumped you
ow
we needta sort some money out later on
because we've got to pay

Mummy doesn't like that
no
listen
there's a big difference with you because
listen
when you're tired
you always hold Mummy's hair
you haven't bumped your head
listen
you always hold Mummy's hair very nicely and gently when you're tired
and when you're upset you like to hold Mummy's hair
and I never mind that because it's gentle
but I do not like you pulling hair
or doing what you just done with it
which is just messing it up for no reason
because that's not nice Thomas
it isn't nice
nobody pulls your hair „ do they
they don't
but they might start if you start pulling other people's hair
they might start pulling yours back
oh yes they might
yes
have a little sit there
because when we went out to post our letter on our little walk we went to the shop „ didn't we
and what did we buy
a magazine
no
we bought two magazines
Mummy bought a magazine and
we bought a magazine for Thomas
now what magazine is this
it's BobTheBuilder
what's that
a stitch
do you know what it is
it's not a stitch
it's a free badge that as come with the magazine
a free BobTheBuilder magazine badge
so when
BobTheBuilder
you singing the BobTheBuilder song „ are you
yes we fix it
so rather than ripping the magazine we'll use these scissors
there we are
there
look at the badge
yes
look there
who is it
and what's he wearing
a telephone
no
he's carrying a telephone
he's carrying his mobile phone
but he's wearing a yellow helmet „ isn't he
and he as got big sturdy boots on
and what as he got round his waist
a coat
that's called a belt
and
you know like Daddy wears a belt to hold his trousers up
and that belt that BobTheBuilder's wearing has tools all the way round it „ doesn't it
so shall we have a look inside
there's
Lofty
the steam roller
big Lofty
well who's this
that's the mixer
and the mixer's called Dizzy
because he goes round and round and round till he's dizzy
and who's this
a crane
is that called Lofty
because he goes very high
he can lift his crane very high „ can't he
one wheel
