right
shall we put our aprons on
right
mine's in here
we've got a lot of things in this cupboard „ haven't we
that need sorting out
when I have time
which isn't now
right
this is Mummy's
actually this is Daddy's
I can reach it easier than mine
because I have one with pussy cats on „ don't I
there you are
this must be one that we brought back from the GoodFoodShow „ isn't it
what as it got on it
snakes and
a whale
a butterfly
buzzy bee
a giraffe
and a lion
kangaroo
and what's that
a big elephant
and the monkeys
so there we are
put your apron on
that's nice „ isn't it
it's a tabard really rather than an apron „ isn't it
a tabard
is that sound funny
a tabard
I'll just wash my hands
what for
because you've been touching all sorts of things
and in a few minutes you might be touching some food
and you can't touch food with dirty hands
because we're going to eat the food later
it might make us poorly if you haven't washed your hands
that's why we hafta do it

yes
look
I'm going to just boil that kettle up for a second
it's going to need some hot water
we needta get some golden syrup out of the tin
well yes
getting it out of the cupboard
oh it's the wow cupboard
you can see in the cupboard „ can't you
well that's a tin of soup
that's not what I'm looking for
I'm looking for
this jar of golden syrup
I'll open it in a minute
right
now what we needta do is get a mug or a jug
this will do
there we are
we're going to put some very hot water in there
just be careful sliding that on there
watch you don't touch that
it's a bit too
and we needta put a tablespoon
in that very hot water
no Thomas
don't do that
you're not to do that darling
it's too noisy
right
I'll put this tablespoon in the jug of hot water
well I'm looking to see what Daddy as done with the Lego spoon
because he keeps using them when he's making bread and he doesn't put them back in the right place „ does he
oh Daddy
what as he done with it
is he
he can't be a silly woman „ can he
if he's a man
but I really don't know what he as done with it Thomas
we'll try in this drawer
no
I can't see it there
right
we'll go and
no
there's one more place to try
it looks like it might be in here
yes
it is
you see this
this measures one tablespoon
well you can hold it and have a little look at it
well we're going to put some golden syrup in it because we needta measure out some tablespoonfuls of syrup
I know you have
right
so we'll stand this in this very hot water and then it means the golden syrup will be easier to get off the spoon
right
now this is your favorite toy
it's not really a toy
it's the weighing scales
weighing scales
I'll just give the pan a quick wash
now we needta weigh out some margarine
let me see
oh you're MissusGoggins
yes
MissusGoggins has scales in the post office
they're different though „ aren't they
because hers are used for weighing letters and parcels so people know what type of stamps to put on
right
now we need nine ounces of margarine
so if we take that weight which is four
no
we'll take this one
nine ounces
we'll take that one that says eight
and we put that one on top that says one
because eight and one are nine
and so it doesn't get too messy we'll put a piece of
oh are you
you're making a wall with the weights
now what I didn't do was check that I had enough margarine before I started
so I hope we have
now what you've got to do Thomas
is just leave
just for now
because otherwise we won't the right number of ingredients „ are we
no
oh yes
we've
right
now don't put anymore on there just for now
no
you can't put anything else on there Thomas
otherwise it's not going to work
now we'll take some margarine
well
no
just leave it
I'll pop the margarine in the scale and when this side goes down you know that you've got quantities on either size that you've got enough
now don't touch it otherwise it'll interfere with it working properly
it's a long time since we've used these scales „ isn't it
well we've just haven't done a lot of baking and cooking „ have we
we did a lot at Christmas
oh I haven't made them yet
yes
don't kick that cupboard
right
look
we're there now
you tell me if it goes down
that means we've got enough margarine in the pan
a little bit more
no
do you think we're alright
no
don't touch it Thomas
don't touch it
hey
there
has it gone down
it's up

it's up at one side but it's down on the other „ isn't it
right
now do you know what we needta do with that
now we've weighed it out if I get pan would you like to pop it into a pan
there we are
get this pan from the cupboard
right
now let's have a look
you take that
can you manage that
tip it into the pan like that
oh what a clever boy
what a clever boy
isn't that lovely
now I'm going to show you what we can do with this
let me just check how much I need
right
we needta weigh out this
this is golden syrup
this is nice and sticky and sweet

do you wanna taste a tiny bit on a teaspoon
I think you've had this on either toast or bread
you liked it
here you are
you just try a little bit
it's very sweet
do you like that
now we have the spoon standing in boiling water
right
now you tip that nice spoon into the pan
nice and quickly
have you got it
that's it
it'll fall off the spoon
you're making a cake „ are you
yes
now
I'll just use my finger to get the rest of the syrup out
oh we're having some
oh you're being a patter cake patter cake bakers man „ aren't you
let's put the spoon back in the water to heat up again
just a moment
and this time we'll measure out not quite so much
we only want half a teaspoon this time
half a tablespoon
just a minute
let me do it
that's it
that's it
you tip it in there
that's a good boy
now that as come off much better „ hasn't it
because we were quicker doing it
how's that
do you wanna lick that spoon
that's very sweet „ isn't it
it tastes a little bit like toffee
now we're going to put this on top of the cooker now
because we're going to melt
we've got margarine and golden syrup
now if we turn the cooker on you mustn't touch it
oh it's not turned on at the wall
I couldn't work out why I couldn't get it to work
there we are
now you must never ever touch that when it's on because you'll get a terrible burn
right
now shall we set the cooker so that we can gauge it when it's ready
Mummy's going to turn this dial round
and again you mustn't do that
no
the cooker doesn't go red
it's just the ring
no
the ring goes between being red and black
there we are
we'll heat it up
and we'll get a warm spoon
can I just move you along a little minute
are you enjoying licking that spoon
yes
is it tasty
it's apple juice „ is it
oh
it was golden syrup a minute ago
but there we are
now if that margarine and syrup golden gets hot it'll all melt
and go really sticky
ugh
sticky and ugh
what will it be
sticky and ugh
sticky and ugh
sticky and gooey and ugh
now we've only got one more thing to weigh out Thomas
no
that's
no
we haven't got any more Thomas
ah
I've got to put some sugar into that
we need six ounces of sugar
so we'll put a four ounce weight and a two ounce weight
that makes six ounces
right
could I just pop you down one second just while I get some sugar
be careful not to touch that „ won't you
oh
never mind
I'll just give that a quick stir because we don't want it to stick on the bottom „ do we
you're making a lot of noise sucking that „ aren't you
right
shall we weigh some sugar out Thomas
silly me
did you think we'd finished
oh no
we've got more to do
now would you like to stand on that stool
no
oh no
not on there
right
now would you like to tip some of this into there
in this big bowl
that's right
I'll help you because it's quite high up
we don't need it all in
oops no
we've got too much
we've got too much so we'll take some out with a spoon
well no
I don't think
just one minute
I'm going to stir what's on the cooker
so let's take some more out because we've got too much sugar in the pan now
I think the cooker's making too much noise actually
I didn't think the new cooker made as much noise as the old one but it does
right
there we are
that's it
now pop that spoon into the washing up bowl because we've finished with that
so shall we put the lid on the sugar pot
now
alright
now if I bring this pan here it's going to be very hot
so don't touch the pan whatever you do
but would you like to tip that into there without touching the pan
there you are
right
you tip that into here
I'll put it down here
don't touch the pan because you might burn
I'll help you
that's it
in it goes
marvelous
right
let's just put that up there
now don't touch the pan but stir the wooden spoon
it's more like wooden trains
why
because it's yellow
is that what you meant
isn't that funny that I knew what you meant
now
oh no
I haven't finished yet
no
not till the biscuits are ready ThomasLastname
you said you wanted to help
we'll do the trains later
come on
we've got some oats to weigh out yet
no Tom
no
have you lost interest now all the sweet things are out of the way
ah no
you said you wanted to help Thomas
well we can't have any biscuits if you're not going to help because I can't do it on my own
it's too difficult
are you going to bring a train in here with me
shh
right
well come in here with the torch
alright
you don't like torches
right
well I shall carry on doing this
is this alright
because you said you were going to help me
I bet you help eat them when they're finished „ don't you
a nice cup of tea
who's having a nice cup of tea
is he
I think we better move
let's move this microphone back here because you've moved
and the cooker's very noisy „ isn't it
right
Mummy as got to weigh out some oats now Thomas
it's a mail train „ is it
would you like to help put some oats in the scales
in the weighing machine
no
who's in trouble
do you remember we useta make porridge with these
can you see the oats
WinniethePooh likes porridge „ does he
he likes honey
does he have honey on his porridge
oh that sounds very nice
it sounds very sweet
right
I've weighed out some oats and I'm going to put them into this
can you see this mixture now
look
this is the butter the sugar and that golden syrup
look
do you wanna give it a good stir
don't touch the bowl because it's hot
that's nice „ isn't it
alright
well we'll tip the oats in „ shall we
and then
do you not need some more help
you don't wanna help me anymore
you're quite happy for me to stir
well if they don't work out right Thomas
it's only Mummy who's to blame „ isn't it
well I hope it works
it doesn't always work „ does it
got a big bump there
a big bump
on the train track
why's there a big bump Thomas
Gordon
what as Gordon got to do with the big bump
the train going too fast
who's saying what as happened
the fat controller
Gordon
Gordon's saying what happened
and what has happened Thomas
pressing a toottoot
what do you mean
do you mean the train went toottoot
oh yes
I thought the train went booboop
boo boop
oh look at this
I should have used a bigger pan really „ shouldn't I
because by the time I've tipped these oats into the other mixture it's very full
is there
under the table there as been a big bash
oh Gordon was going too fast
is that why there as been a big bump
oh goodness me
I didn't realize that Thomas
that's all you need „ isn't it
that's what happens when people go too fast „ isn't it
are you putting some traffic signs up now
are you warning people not to drive too quickly
would you like a mix of this Thomas
a stir
you don't
would you like to see it before it goes in the oven
look
oh Thomas you're showing no interest and you were very excited
look
all the oats have gone into that liquid
it's thick now „ isn't it
yes
do you wanna put it into the tin ready to bake
like a Christmas cake
yes
only it's a completely different shape to the Christmas cake
you've gone over the water
lotsof
lotsof
lotsof doon
what's lotsof doon
I'm not quite sure what you mean Thomas
yes
I do
no
I don't think I do actually
oh Gordon's saying stop now „ is he
Gordon's obviously realized that when he went to fast it caused problems „ didn't he
oh you're making a lot of noise ThomasHenry „ aren't you
no
I'm not making chips
I'm putting the flapjack mixture into a baking tin
I'm a silly sausage „ am I
why
you don't know
ah that's nice
you call me a silly sausage and then you give me a big kiss
good boy
oh Thomas be careful
I will be crying if you've broken anything
no
I'm not crying Thomas
you want me to pretend to cry

you're very upset
oh there's an ambulance coming with flashing lights because I'm crying
well I'm only crying because you didn't help me finish this
well I don't think I need an ambulance to call Thomas
just because I'm a little bit upset because you didn't help me finish the flapjack
I'll probably
alright
oh dear
oh I am upset
I'm in a terrible state
hello
ah you're giving your Mummy a big hug
and a stroke
oh yes
I feel much better
thank you
are you an ambulance driver now
oh I thought you were a train driver a minute ago
you've changed your mind
well come back in here where I can see you Thomas
yes
but an ambulance driver wouldn't leave somebody to cry on their own
he'd come with them

oh I'm very upset
I don't like being on my own when I'm upset
I wish there was somebody here
what are you doing ThomasHenry
you're a fireman now
well why am I crying and a fireman
but why is the fireman coming because I'm crying
I'm crying because I'm baking
do you think I've set the kitchen on fire
and that's why I'm crying and the fireman's coming to the rescue
oh dear dear
I was making flapjack and the pan caught fire
and the oven's on fire
and the kitchen's alight
I'm very upset
what I could do with is a big strong fireman to come and put it out for me
quick Thomas
the house is burning down
Thomas what are you doing
well I think he'd be a little bit quicker than you are
oh I'm AuntyMabel now „ am I
oh well if it's AuntyMabel it's bound to be the chip pan that as caught fire „ has it
I thought so
hello Fireman
Fireman while you're here would you like to help me put it into the oven
no
again we mustn't touch the oven because it's very hot
but look
there we are
look
oh well no
it's a dirty cloth Thomas
do you wanna wipe your fire engine with it
now we've got all this stuff to put away now „ haven't we
shall we put the lid back on the oats
what are you doing
you're mixing the oats
what are you making
you're making a hat for Santa
using oatmeal
that sounds a strange thing to be doing
is is „ isn't it
you'd like me to help you
right
what are we doing
a snow clown
what's a snow clown
that big bears say
the big brown Teletubbie says
„ isn't it
WinniethePooh likes this „ does he
does he stir it like you're doing
are you
if you're BobtheBuilder what's the oatmeal
it's cement
it's not oatmeal
it's cement
oh I see
right
well as long as I know
BobtheBuilder have you got any cement at your building yard
could I see it please
oh is that where it is
oh that's nice
that's a very big tub „ isn't it
you've been building it a long while and it's not finished yet
I see
alright
I'll stay over here and you finish over there
it's a big huge hole „ is it
and you're filling it with the cement
well why am I saying toottoot
what does toottoot mean
no
I don't Thomas
you keep saying yes I do but I don't really understand
stay away AuntyMabel
I'm just watching carefully that you don't tip it on the floor
you seem to be having alot of fun
just be careful
don't get right up to the top of the tub
that's it
otherwise it'll go over the side and it'll be wasted „ won't it
oh I don't think there's a big snake in it
no
it's just a tub of oatmeal Thomas
it's a storage container full of oatmeal
I think you're thinking about the program that you watched on television where they had
it was lovely
they had great big vats
big bowls of all sorts of different things
they had a big bowl of green jelly and a big bowl of mud
and a big bowl of RiceKrispies
and children hadta put their hands in „ didn't they
and find what was in the bottom
there were
yes
there were toy snakes and all sorts of things
it looked good fun „ didn't it
it was very messy but it looked like it was good fun
is that what you're doing now
you're mixing the oatmeal expecting to find something
it's today
right
I'm just going to have a peep in the oven
peep
I was just having a quick glance at the flapjack
we might as well start putting things like the margarine back into the fridge
and we've finished with that jar of golden syrup „ haven't we
no
you've not finished with the oatmeal
that's fine
you can play with that a little bit longer
oh BobtheBuilder there's a huge hole in the middle of the road have you got some cement please to fill it in
would you mind doing that little job for me please
that's a good boy
oh yes
you haven't got your BobtheBuilder hat on have you
oh dear dear
you're going to go and get it

good boy
well I'm sorry but I hadta stand on your stool just so I could put some things back in the cupboard
I'm only small
I can't reach
here you are
I'll stay over here
yes
that's fine
oops a daisy
are you still mixing the cement
you're doing a good job „ aren't you Bob
you're singing a little tune
right
just a moment
we'll answer the phone
what a nice song
you sing it
Daddy knows the words to BobtheBuilder
Mummy doesn't know that one all that well
I think Daddy's quite fascinated by it „ isn't he
oh no

there we are
I think we'll just turn the oven down a little bit because it's a noisy oven
it's a fan oven
and I've just realized with it being a fan oven I shouldn't have turned the temperature quite so high
I'm just going to do one four seven one on the telephone Thomas
to see who that was telephoning
because they put the phone down
they didn't leave a message
oh look
it sounds like AuntyLinda
it sounds like AuntyLinda's telephone number
pardon
the cement's like a sausage „ is it
oh just be very careful if you're putting it in there Thomas
you've got to be careful not to spill it „ haven't you
would you like this
oh just steady darling
please be careful
you're going to waste it
would you like this big spoon
look
well just you try it
you see just how much more you can lift with this big spoon
no
that's better
that's right
move the cement nearer the scale pan

you need what darling
you need lotsof
lotsof cement
Thomas you keep saying dedede
that doesn't me a thing „ does it
it doesn't mean a thing to me
dedede
it just means you're making up silly words
no
not your hands
the spoon only please
not your hands in food
so when you wanna play with your train
no
you only use your
only use the spoon
that's a good boy
no
not your hands Thomas
it's food
I know you're pretending it's cement but it's food really
you're having alot of fun with that „ aren't you
hm
I think this might soon be ready
did she
why did Purdie bite your finger
you don't know
no
don't
if you're licking your fingers now you're going to hafta have your hands washed before you put them back
no
let's just wipe your hands

you've been sucking your fingers Thomas
and you can't suck your fingers and then do that with food
that's it
why did Purdie bite you darling
you don't know
had it something to do with you perhaps pulling her tail
well you do know then „ don't you
wipe your hands now
that's a good boy
that's a good boy
no
we needta leave that up there Thomas
because it'll tip up otherwise
it's a little bit wobbly the scale pan „ isn't it
can you see
your BobtheBuilders hat's in the way „ isn't it
oh I'm watching what you're doing
yes
is that what you said
watch AuntyMabel
watch what my doing
well I'm watching all you're doing
I think you're doing a good job actually Thomas
sorry Bob
you're doing an excellent job Bob
and I'm very pleased
I'm Wendy „ am I
I thought I was AuntyMabel
well Wendy and AuntyMabel both think you're doing an excellent job Thomas
clever boy
you're a clever builder „ aren't you
well it won't be very far „ will it
it's nearly ready
it needs another few moments
then we'll take it out the oven and we'll into squares
triangles
oh yes
we could cut it into triangles I suppose
and then we'll let it cool on the rack
are you enjoying that
it smells like CocaCola to you „ does it
I don't think it really smell of anything „ does it
it smells like Ribena to you
well no
I think Ribena smells beautiful
it smells of blackcurrant
oatmeal doesn't smell of anything really „ does it
and it doesn't particularly taste
don't put your fingers in
it doesn't particularly taste of anything unless it's mixed with other ingredients „ does it
if it's mixed with
that's right
if it's mixed with milk to make porridge it tastes nice
oh no
no Thomas
look
you can't do that
no
it's all tipping out
look what as happened
look
can I show you
look
it as all tipped up
and if it's mixed with what we've mixed it with today sugar butter and golden syrup it's nice „ isn't it
ah
and sometimes we mix it with a
oh don't be nasty Thomas
no
I don't think BobtheBuilder
I bet you've never ever heard BobtheBuilder speak to Wendy like that „ have you
no
I shan't stay away Thomas
no
no
you're getting a little bit too bossy
and that's not nice
and I'm absolutely sure you've never ever heard BobtheBuilder tell Wendy to stay away „ have you
no
no
a few minutes ago you wanted AuntyMabel to watch what you were doing
and now I am watching you don't like it
oh you're using the big spoon
that's a good idea
wow
that's lovely „ isn't it
what are you making
dedede

yes
it's getting awful full with oatmeal „ isn't it
right
I'd empty it now Thomas
you can empty it

I wasn't going to empty it
I was just suggesting that you did
that's right
yes
it's a big spoon but you don't hafta fill it „ do you
you can take some little scoops
right
what do we think to this now
it looks like a chocolate cake to you „ does it
I still think we'll leave it another few moments
into the
that's it
into the container
putting the hat
you're using two spoons now
oh you're a butcher now „ are you
what are you making
right
I think that needs to go back on there because it'll tip up
Thomas steady
no
now come on
if you're going to start doing this we'll hafta stop because you're just getting it everywhere now „ aren't you
you're not being careful like you were to start with
well if you're a butcher could you weigh me half a pound of bacon please
oh cooked bacon smells delicious
oh I want some more things
I'll pay for it all at once
could I have two lamb chops as well please
there you are
yes
well pop it in the bag over there

I bet it is a lot for all that meat
that's the till „ is it

oh thank you so much
that's very kind
thank you
I shall see you next week MisterButcher

ooh I'm just about to leave the shop and I've realized that you sell bread and milk „ don't you
oh please could I have a pint of milk and half a dozen eggs please
oh don't
no
don't leave your hat on top of there Thomas
no
you've got to keep it clean
no
you pop your hat on
pop your hat on
it's the lid that goes on there
like that
do you wanna put the nice blue lid back on
no
oh okay
right
let's have one more look in the oven
what do you think now
well if it looks like a chocolate cake it must be black
I think that'll probably be alright „ don't you
you think so as well
turn that noisy cooker off
that's better „ isn't it
look at that
it'll be a little bit too hot to eat at the moment
I'll get a nice sharp knife and I'll cut it
there we are
how many pieces shall we cut it into
two
it'll be big pieces if we just cut it into two „ won't they
yes darling
what's on my nose
a big crocodile on my nose
goodness me
I bet snap went the crocodile
I think we'll cut these into fairly small pieces Thomas
then we don't eat such a large piece „ do we
are you still a butcher „ are you
oh no
you mustn't put that in there Tom
no
you mustn't put
no
you mustn't
no
no
you can't
have you put anything else in there
no
you mustn't darling
I'm sorry
oh dear
have I been thrown out the butcher shop
no
you mustn't put anything in there Thomas
no
you can put them on the scale pan
but you don't put anything in the food Thomas
no
you can't
you mustn't
no
if you're going to start being like that we'll put the whole lot away
Thomas don't be nasty
Thomas have you put another weight there because I can't find the one that says number one on it
have you put the ounce weight in here
well that's silly „ isn't it
just imagine if you're eating porridge in the morning and you swallow it because you didn't know it was in there
where do you think it is
is it definitely in there
yes
well you better find it
just use the spoon
I think it's a number one not a number six
right
I wanna get a different knife now from the drawer
oh I don't think they're toys darling
they're things that Mummy uses when she's cooking
there are one or two things in there that we don't use very often
there's a little round green plastic thing that if you press it onto bread it makes the face like they have on Tubbie toast „ doesn't it
before we toast the bread
you're making toast
a lot of toast in there „ isn't there
oh that's because I said Tubbie toast „ isn't it
let's just see if I'm any nearer finding that weight
I don't know where the weight as gone
you took the weights from the scale pan and dropped them into the oatmeal „ didn't you
we found them all but the one ounce one

look

did you hear that
it's the sound of the weight
I just can't
it's there
look
there
there we are
they're all accounted for now

I hafta keep blowing my nose
washing my hands
