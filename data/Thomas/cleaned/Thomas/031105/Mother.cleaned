right
I think the first thing's let's get our hands washed
okay
now there's lotsof things in the sink
that's it
don't put your hands in the bowl just do it under the tap
that's it
there we go
a bit of soap
that's good
a nice little bit of soap

the chef's hat
well I'm sure you could
there you go
and dry your hands and if you wanna run upstairs and get that but come straight down please
he might have put it away
dry your hands properly
run upstairs but be ever so quick coming back down please
well before you put it on you needta put your tabard on so I mean you can't get it over your head if your wearing a hat so just carry the hat down please
okay
ooh Tom
banging and clattering
Thomas be quick
be quick Thomas
I don't know
you had it yesterday
it was what
hiding under the bed
right
let's put this tabard on
your hands are nice and clean and you've got your chef's hat on „ haven't you
okay
there we go
pop it on
you can get all the things you need „ can you
right
the first thing and do you know what that is
sugar
it is
it's icing sugar that „ isn't it
just one moment Tom
it's alright
you don't need the stool it can go back over to the table there
right
we'll weigh the sugar out
yes
right
now you needta find
the weight that says four on it please
not a little four just it says four on its own that one and the four means a quarter
just one that should say four
all on it's own
no
it says four
we're looking for one that says four
one that says four
what does that say
four
right
well pop that on that brass plate then
we don't need the other weights now „ do we
right
no we don't
just put the four there
we don't need any of the other weights Thomas
no
we don't need any weights
and we needta tip this into here
yes
put the other weights away please
we don't need them
that's it
icing sugar is very powdery and all the dust floats up „ doesn't it
now we've got to watch very carefully and when you think it's going down shout Mummy it as gone down
has it gone down
right
well that's four ounces of sugar
okay
no
you'll break it
right now we needta put that into a barrel but before we do that we needta sieve it
get a sieve
where as the sieve gone Thomas
there's one up there look
the other one's in the dishwasher I think „ isn't it
not to worry
now what sort of spoon is this Thomas
a wooden spoon
there
would you like to tip that into the bowl
okay
you look very nice with your hat on
proper chef „ aren't you
and now we wanna put some hot water in
the kettle boiled not so long ago so water from the kettle and we needta measure this out with these measuring spoons
that one's a tablespoon so if I put water in and when it's filled to the top you can tip it into the bowl
that's it
we'll try another one
we won't put too much water in
I might use a whisk rather than a wooden spoon for this
let me see where that little whisk is
right
here's the whisk
I'll just put the kettle back
we don't want that on the table
if it's too stiff we'll add a little bit more water to it
okay
what's the matter
oh

cheeky monkey
while my back was turned
is it very tasty
I'm sure you can in a minute Tom
look
you're going to hafta wash your hands again
every time you lick your hands
your fingers
you're going to hafta go and wash them again
when you touch the food
I think the time to lick the icing is at the end when you've finished „ don't you
that's a little bit runny that so I think we'll add a little more
icing sugar
no
when we've finished that's the time to lick otherwise you'll hafta keep going and washing your hands
right now this time let's just add say another half an ounce
I know we should be metric but we're not cause the weights aren't
watch the scales and tell me when the sugar is heavier than the weight
it as gone down
right
would you like to tip that into the bowl please
no
tip that into the bowl
no
the icing sugar into the bowl
that's a good boy
we'll hafta do lotsof buns like this for birthday party „ won't we
hm
you can in a minute when it's mixed
that feels a little bit thicker
if it's too runny it's going to run straight off the buns „ isn't it
we've been cheating today cause usually we make our own buns
we make the mixture and we put the buns into bun cases
the mixture into bun cases and we bake the buns
then we cool them
then we ice them
now today we've actually bought some buns „ haven't we
that's still a little bit runny
let's try another
would you like to put the one that says oneq on there please
shout me when you see it going down
down
right
put some sugar into the bowl please
make holes
there we are
that should be fine now
what do you think
it looks a bit like snow „ doesn't it
there we are
would you like a little whizn with the whisk
that's it
I'll hold the bowl
do you like that
no
you don't lick it from there Thomas
mix it up
we've got to have it so that there are no lumps of sugar left
we should've sieved it really „ shouldn't we
what color is it
and is it shiny
the sugar's dull „ isn't it
and then you put the water in
and what happens when you put the water in
it goes shiny „ doesn't it
it changes color
it's still white
it's just a different sort of white
no
I want you to go and wash your hands again now please Thomas
we can eat one of the buns when we're done
okay
what does it taste of
does it
that's quite surprising really cause there aren't lemons or strawberries in it „ are there
okay
would you like a towel darling
it's here
towel
and while you're down we'll reach these buns
they're in the box with the blue lid
can you see them
there should be two boxes with blue lids
I think we need both of them
we need both of them please
okay
you're a clever boy „ aren't you
right
now
would you like to reach a tray please
the tray that you had before
that's the tray
that's it
now I think we'll move that chair out of the way
we don't need a chair „ do we
okay
now
let's open the box
and get some out
would you like to unwrap them
they're wrapped in plastic „ aren't they
we won't take them out of the bun cases
we'll just take them out of the cellophane
and then put them in the tray
that's right
right
what I'll do with this whisk Thomas
I've given the icing an extra big whisk
I tell you what I'll open this and you can take the buns out
here you are
I'll open the cellophane and you take the buns out
right
look at this icing now dropping off this whisk
I'll put the whisk with the icing on into the weighing pan on the scales
ooh
look who's outside
who's that
I never heard his siren „ did you
never heard his siren his little
today's the day the teddy bears had a picnic
yes
there's lotsof rubbish in the bin
right
we'll watch him drive away in a minute
let's see if anybody as gone to him „ shall we
oh yes
somebody has
who's that
is that Liam's Mummy
no
oh he as driven away
let's just listen and see if we can hear him ring when he gets round to Christopher's house
listen
I though I could hear something then but we usually hear him „ don't we
well the dripdrip is the dripdrip of the tap when you didn't turn it off
but we usually hear him sing the teddy bears picnic and I didn't hear him sing that „ did you
oh you're clever
now you're taking the label off the box
that's going to make a lovely sound as you rip the plastic label off the box
that's fantastic Thomas
cause they're not easy to get off those „ are they
is it stuck to your hand now
big rip
oh
are you fighting with it

oh it as come off beautifully actually
this one has as well
I hadn't really thought about taking the label off this lid cause I thought it would be a nuisance to get off but you managed that so well
more bun cases
yes
this is the cheats way „ isn't it
right
well we'll leave some of them wrapped
thank you
do you remember when we had a coffee morning
on friday
last Friday „ wasn't it
I got up at five o'clock in the morning to make biscuits cause we had a lot of people coming „ didn't we
they came and they had cups of tea and cups of coffee and homemade biscuits and on the table we had balloons and daffodils and we had more biscuits ready for people to take home „ didn't we
and you put smarties in jars „ do you remember that
so people could guess how many smarties were in a jar and all the money raised went to meningitis „ didn't it
and it was two hundred and four pounds or two hundred and seven pounds I think by the end
let's just count how many we've got
right
let's open two more
one more packet with two buns in
got three more packets but we'll only open one more with two buns in and then we've got a dozen buns „ haven't we
twelve buns
what shape are these buns Thomas
they're not square „ are they
they're not round like normal buns
what are they
rectangles
they're made in Spain these
no
yes but we're not going to unwrap anymore now Thomas
we'll see if we've got enough icing first
no we can leave those wrapped up in the packet Thomas please
right
and how many are there
if there are two in each packet and you have two packets how many have you got
five
oh

now
we'll put some icing on
you can do that and we've got to go in the cupboard for something else
this will be nice
ha ha
what as Mummy got from Mrs sweet shop

and we've got some smarties left from another day „ haven't we

right
now let's just do one at a time Thomas
so we don't get messy
okay
before you start let's get a plate
this little plate will be fine
one plate now
one bun at a time
now put the icing on the bun
that's it
are you going to talk to me while you're doing it and tell me what you're doing
no Thomas

okay
no
we need more than that
let me do one just to show you
I'll do this one to show you and then we won't fall out „ will we

if we just drizzle a little bit right along the bun like that then look what's
yes

now look the icing will start to drizzle down the sides
I hope that green jelly baby's for the bun „ is it

drizzling it onto the cake

well normally we buy jelly babies in bags „ don't we
I went into MrsSweetshop the other day and I asked for some jelly babies
she said oh I haven't got any bags I've just got them loose in a jar
so she weighed me out
she had scales like this
she took a big glass jar down from the shelf that's the little sweet shop in Didsbury
I told her how many I wanted and she weighed them out
and then she she poured them straight from that spout on the weighing pan into a bag and then I paid her and said thank you MrsSweetshop
bye byeq
and I said Thomas and I are going to make some buns
and she thought that sounded really nice and there was another lady in the shop who said when it was her birthday she always has chocolate M and Ms on her cake
have you seen those
little sweets
they look like smarties and they're called M and Ms
they're all different colors
because apparently when she was a little girl
well not a little girl but when she was growing up she grew up in a different country and she said M and Ms were available in the shops there a long time before they were available in our shops
so to remind her of home when it's her birthday she always puts M and Ms on her cake
what sort of cake would you like
FiremanSam cake

Ben
who was it
I thought you told me somebody had a FiremanSam cake

then we haven't got a bare bun

and you hafta go to the hospital and they put you in an ambulance and put you on a stretcher and wheel you into the hospital and say I think we needta xray this little boy
and put the big camera on your tummy and they'll say ah he as been eating green jelly babies
cause when you have an xray they can see everything
everything inside of you
see your bottom
and they'd see all the jelly babies and all the smarties
and they'd say there's a little boy who wasn't concentrating when he crossed the road that's why he got knocked down
he was too busy thinking about jelly babies and sweets and icing and cakes
