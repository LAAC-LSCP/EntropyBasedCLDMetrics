no
I don't think there'll be any
pardon
Linda's having her lunch now „ is she
well we'll be having ours in a few minutes „ won't we
right
what have you got there Tom
a London train
right
oh I needn't guess where it's gone then
London
well I was just about to say I needn't ask where it's gone
obviously going to London „ isn't it
yes
yes
do you
is it
that sounds a bit strange
well having to jump to get on the train
do you mean if I wanna catch the train
I've got to literally jump in the air to catch it
well it just sounds a bit strange to me Thomas does that
is it
right
I'm struggling with all my cases
well if I'm catching a train to London
I must have luggage with me „ mustn't I
because I don't live in London
so I'm going to need something when I get there
to wear
well I think I'm going to miss it „ don't you
I'm just a bit worried about having to jump
to catch it
is it
what do you mean
it pulls up alongside the platform
oh well that's alright then „ isn't it
just
well okay
I've just got to put these things back
no
it isn't a water gun
it's a bubble machine
it's like a water gun but it just makes bubbles
oh they're old
they're all underpants that I use
sometimes when I'm polishing shoes
because when you're putting polish on shoes
no
I don't really want it
thank you
right
come on
when I'm putting polish on these shoes
I wrapped old clothes because they're just not thrown away

and so it's quite a good idea to use underpants Thomas
did you know that
I hope so
why
it's alright
we're alright because we're talking about pants
we're not being rude „ are we
look
I've found a cork here Thomas
oh think that for mine
is it
how do you know that
is it
might not mean it's very old though „ does it
does it
has it
oh do you not want it
oh unless if you don't want it put it in an ashtray
infact I think that's one I found outside
did you know that
have you taken one outside or dropped one
I am yes
Thomas when did the
oh I thought they were
I was just about to say when did the rubbish men come
but they haven't been „ have they
it's just that they've cleared them all
yes it could „ couldn't it
I like that for a suitcase
because it looks like it's got a lot of money in it
has it
right
okay
we're using a till for the suitcase „ aren't we
do you know what I'm watching
I thought the bin men had collected all the bags
because the bags have moved from outside of the house
but they the other side of the road
who's having a look in the bucket or the bin bags
naughty magpie
and what happened last week to the
do you remember all the bin bags near Janes house
something went peck
and ripped open all the bin bags
left an awful mess
I think actually it might have been a fox
rather than a magpie Thomas
because there was such a lot of damage „ wasn't there
we watch magpies chomping away on the bin bags
at the back of the house
you know Battersby's live
but I mean those were just pecks in the bags
but outside Jane's house
absolutely everything had been
uncovered from the bag „ hadn't it
pardon
a what
do you think a fox was looking
for a dog fast asleep in the bin bag
for a pussy cat
well I'd sooner think that somebody had thrown something out
like some chicken or
tuna or something that they hadn't finished
and that would smell very attractive „ wouldn't it
to a fox
MisterFox must have thought mm lunch time
right
so getting back to this
where's my suitcase
right
oh here's the train
that's alright
it's not too far „ is it
right
case in
I'm in
well don't tell me nothing's going to happen now I've rushed
what's happening to the train
why's that
is he waiting for other people
oh that's alright then
am I
but you were rushing me
you were telling me to hurry
oh right
were you not telling other people to hurry
you were
right
oops
is that the noise it makes
but I've been on ages
I was the first passenger on remember
oh yes
forget
oh is this little mine
no
it sounded a little bit like him
oh they are tossing and turning „ aren't they
what's happening
right
it's a zippy that one „ isn't it
good heavens
now he must have been zippy Thomas
to have got to London so quickly „ mustn't he
don't you think
is that a zippy train
right
and what's going to happen in London
not many exciting things
oh why
oh are they
oh right
and what sort of fair
oh right
on wednesday
and what sort of fair
will there be lotsof rides and stalls
mhm
oh I need some assistance I think
I've packed it so full
I wasn't sure what the weather was going to be like
I thought if it's cold I'm going to need a jumper
if it's wet I'll need my wellies
if it's sunny I'll need my sunhat
I've just brought everything
will you help me
you'll be my assistant „ will you
you'll assist me
oh thank you very much
and then I can just get a trolley „ can't I
and put the suitcase on the trolley
and wheel it away
and that will be that
that's a very long train
but they usually are the London trains „ aren't they
now is that sposta be a trolley now
to help me with my suitcase
thank you
have you got a lift
have you got a lift at the station
you don't know
oh is it
oh I see
well where do you normally go to
to which station
Policewood
Fleecewood
Priestwod
oh right
where's Priestwood
just down the lane
oh it sounds like a local station that „ is it
is it not a great big one
oh right
Priestwood
no
don't do that Tom
so where have you heard somebody say Priestwood
I've never heard of Priestwood
did you
oh that's a good made up name
what sort of people live in Priestwood
is it a town
or is it a country
town
a small town
it sounds just
oh thank you so much
oh yes
because do you remember the last time we went to Piccadilly
we actually saw one of those Thomas
we saw that lady with all her suitcases
sitting in a sort of luggage cart
do you remember
and the guard was pulling her along
I bet she was embarrassed actually
because she looked quite funny „ didn't it
oh no
the guard wasn't pulling it
no
it was it was a little truck
but the lady the passenger
was sitting with the guard in the front
and she had all her suitcases in the back
and it was trundling along
and normally you just see a driver
pulling a cart load of suitcases
but only this time he had a passenger as well
so I imagine the lady was very grateful
because
she didn't look as if she'd be able to walk very far
and you know poor guard on his own
he couldn't of carried all her suitcases
and she certainly couldn't carry them
so it was a very useful little thing „ wasn't it
I'm on
luggage is on
because you helped me thank you
off we go
chuff
well I'm going to a hotel
oh look
there's pussy cat fast asleep outside on the path
you see

ah
the magpie's gone as well
well have I actually arrive in London
well I thought I would stay in a hotel for a few days
I have actually booked a hotel
but I somebody told me I could get a taxi
right
but I don't think you can bring the railway truck
on the road outside
I think you'd have
oh is it
there is a Piccadilly in London „ isn't there
because I've
oh right
well there's Piccadilly in Manchester
but it
but I'm at Piccadilly in London „ aren't I
I thought I'd arrived in London
well you see if I hailed a taxi
if I put my hand up and get a taxi
then I'm sure all my luggage would go in the taxi
and the taxi driver would take me to the hotel
and then when I got there
either the taxi driver would help me
or the porter at the hotel would help
but I thought I was going to London on holiday
a flat
my hotel
oh right
well you've been a very kind train driver
I've never come across such a helpful train man before
no doubt you want a very big tip „ do you
tipping it into the house
oh
but I was meaning a tip
when you give somebody a tip
like a taxi driver or a porter
it's when you think a when you think
they've done a really good job
when you think they've served you well
and you just give them a little bit extra money
you pay the bill
you pay them whatever you owe them for the bill
and then you say you've done a jolly good job well done
and give them a little bit extra
and that's called giving a tip
so I'm going to give you a tip
because I have never come across a worker
who's worked so hard with my luggage before
let me open my purse
well here we are
there's some money here
look
there you are
there's a five pound note
that's quite alright
you've done a jolly good job
do you do this for all your passengers
not often
and what was so special about me
that you thought you'd help me with mine
you thought you'd be kind to people
oh that's nice
has somebody been very kind to you
oh right
oh right
well I suppose
was probably being kind to somebody once
and they've give you a very nice tip
and you've thought oh that's much better than people being grumpy
and not giving me any money
so I'll be kind to everybody at work
it's like I say Thomas
if you are pleasant to people
if you are nice and kind and polite
they are the same back „ aren't they usually
usually not always
I thought was what
incredible
incredible
my goodness that is incredible
where have you heard that word
incredible
you wanted to say it
but you must have heard it
incredible s a very long word Thomas
it's a lovely word
goodness that's a loud delivery truck „ isn't it
don't you think that's a very loud delivery truck
yes
bye
thank you so much for all your kindness
have a nice day
a nice tea
oh actually it's
cup of tea
Mister Delivery man
seeing as you worked so hard
would you like to join me for a cup of tea
I'll treat you to a nice cup of tea
and a plate of biscuits in the hotel
well you can come now
we'll order it
shall we order it at reception
brubru
that's the man on reception ding
well I think you'd better park your truck up outside „ don't you
I don't think you can drive your truck into the hotel
that way
special delivery van I think
it's a bit smaller „ isn't it
hello
how are you
your metal machine
oh yes
it's rather like a skip lorry that Thomas
no
I'm sure it isn't
no
now what are we doing with this nice special machine
what's
right
yes
there's the telephone
right
yes
and what would you be using that for today
right
but what would you be using a truck like that for
when you were at the station and then coming to a hotel
with me for tea
I see
that is a big green parcel there „ isn't it
what's in that
okay
right
okay
I bet Daddy's got all sorts of rubbish „ hasn't he
luggage wise
what's he got in his luggage
has he
oh dear
I bet he's got computer equipment
I thought so
I thought Daddy couldn't possibly go away on holiday
for a few days without taking something
oh dear
it's impossible and incredible
very good words Tom
impossible and incredible
bye
thank you so much
well oh you haven't had your tea
you forgot
are you really thirsty
or are you not too bad
never have a break
and you work so hard
do you
what kind
right
what do you usually have on your sandwich
right
cheese and pickle
right
do you
right
would you like sandwiches
don't you
well here we are
look
we're in this nice hotel
and here's a nice pot of tea
shall I pour it
look
this could be the tea pouring
pour
could our bead counter could be the tea
okay
that's right
the bead can be the sugar and the milk as well
yes
we're going to have some
going to have some biscuits as well
lotsof biscuits

oh we're getting a bit tangles up with our
refreshment machine „ aren't we
is it

they're blowing away
oh running away
how can a biscuit run away Thomas
is it like the ginger bread man
you mean that sort of running away
ha
do you
I think we oughta just have some lunch actually
it's getting to that time „ isn't it
what do you think
shall we have some lunch
right
oh look
something's come through the letter box
what's this
it's a little envelope about cancer care
MaireCurie cancer care
well somebody who's
poorly darling
sometimes need special nurses
just one moment



bye
well I think it was actually Liam and his Daddy
who were delivering that leaflet
I just stuck my head out of the door
I think it was Liam and his Daddy
well what happens
I mean Mummy you know when we occasionally
collect for things
in envelopes
what you do is
you pop an envelope through somebody's door
and it tells you on it
look
it says it's for
please help us to continue our work
every penny you give to cancer care makes a difference
help us to make the lives of people living with cancer
in the United Kingdon a little better
so what you do
you pop some money in there
you're playing wheels on the bus

we put money in
and then if you go into
no
it won't
yes I think it's Liam and his Daddy Steve
who are collecting it
they'll knock on the door
and say have you got your envelope
and we'll say yesq
and hand it back to them
and then they hand it in
and then this big charity gets lotsof pennies
and it puts it to good use
and Mummy's friend's husband
is very poorly at the moment
and he's got special nurses come up to the house
to help look after him
so it is quite important
and infact do you see this rose
in this vase here
does that look like a real rose
no
it's not a real rose „ is it
because it's got a pin on it
no look
what does that say
that came off the rose
Cancer Care Appeal
that rose is the same
I bought that rose from somebody
and the money I put in their pot
is going to the same cause
it's going to help people who are really not very well
so that's worth while „ isn't it
right
lunchy punchy time
for the delivery man
the hotel worker
the truck driver
and the train driver
because you're a busy boy
don't jump on the chairs
do want more
oh Thomas
don't do that
gosh have you lost weight

I suppose it's because
oh no
hold on
you must you're older than I thought
otherwise I will drop you
no
what I mean is
I suppose it's because I haven't picked you up
but you sort of jumped into my arms
but you don't feel that heavy
right
oh no
that's probably what it is
I can't bend down
to pick you up now
no
I'm frightened that I'll hurt my back
you're too heavy for that
I must when I try to cuddle you
oh you're a big dead weight
oh I know why you're so thin
you've not had your lunch
come on
right
what are you going to eat
crisps
you're not having crisps
would you like some toast
with something on it
we've got quavers
right
Thomas calm
excuse me
Thomas
now look
put those back
put those back
take those things
that you've knocked on the floor
and get your hands washed please
come on
if it's on the fridge magnet on the fridge
it's obviously something important
that we wanna keep
isn't it
right
come on
to the sink and get your hands washed please
wet your hands in the water
nice smell
I don't know
the smell
I can't smell anything love
I can smell the soap that you're washing your hands with
give them a really good rinse in the water please
there you are
black jam
well do you want toast with black jam or not
quavers
or did you want those
what was the crisp
no
don't touch any of the others
hula hoops
salt and vinegar hula hoops
is that what you like
quavers
right
oh look
there's Steve and his Daddy
going back now
I think it must have been them
not Steve and his Daddy
Liam and his Daddy
I think it must have been them that delivered
the envelope „ don't you
mm
haven't you
right
there's a
do they
sausage
would you like some sausage
there you are
that's left from yesterday
right
would you like toast Thomas

it does „ doesn't it
it's like a little creature
and it's a sausage saying helloq
coming out of the
would you like toast
or would you just like bread
I'm going to have a sandwich
no
don't say whatever
I'm asking you what you like
you'd like a sandwich
what would you like in the sandwich
cheese
well I'm having a cheese sandwich
but you've got sausages
you can have a cheese sandwich if you like
in a sandwich
okay
I will
don't you be bossy now
a suitcase
that's my handbag
just moved it from the table
so that we can get lunch
oops
what are your wellies doing under the chair Tom
no
no
no
I can't let you use the grater Darling
it's too dangerous
if your fingers slip you'll grate your fingers
it's a job for a much bigger boy
because even holding the grater
it's very sharp on the outside
can you watch the cheese going through the top
look
look
through the hole at the top
no
don't do that
yeah but I can't grate
without covering that
well you can't I don't think
can you see now
look through there
is that better
Thomas
don't be silly
stop it
cheese
what was that AuntyMabel program that makes soup
what did they call them
nuggets
or noodles
because that looks a bit like noodles
when cheese is grated
you know the things that they made
soap out of
it was soap „ wasn't it Thomas
I've forgotten now what we grated
but we grated something „ didn't we
no
no
no
don't touch the grater Thomas
it's like a sharp knife
it's one of those things that you can't
well all I can say is
when you chop your fingers off
and you won't be seeing sympathy from me
because you've been told not to touch
no
your Dad would be very cross
because you've been told not to touch it
if you're going to hold it
hold it there
never rub your fingers along there
I didn't
I was just showing you where not to rub
no
I wouldn't touch it
because if I had it would have grated my fingers
if it's capable of grating things
like hard carrot
and hard pieces of cheese Thomas
it would do a lot of damage to your fingers „ wouldn't it
you could
but I'm not to
because I think it would be a bit messy „ don't you
oh I could try a bit
I don't know whether it would work though
right
let's just try a little sausage
there we are
grates it up
look
here the sausage comes
now you've got to eat those now
hm no
it's too messy „ isn't it
sausage crumbs
do you want me to put the sausage crumbs in the cheese sandwich
I've got a cheese and sausage
cheese and sausage crumb sandwich

you can grate onion
that's a good thing to grate
we've tried grating sausage now
and it wasn't a brilliant success „ was it
so
probably never bother grating it again
it's only a tiny bit anyway
in this sandwich
mhm
oh yes if you grated all that
it would make quite a big pile
of grated sausage
and then you could have a grated sausage
grated sausage sandwich
can't say it
would you like a drink Thomas
sorry
and then we can have some fruit for desert „ can't we
where do you think Linda had been
she came back with some bags „ didn't she
were they shopping bags
right
I'm having a cheese sandwich
infact I might have two cheese sandwiches
right
I'm going to put some pickle in mine
oh it's nice
it's very nice
I'll get you a drink first
you made a what Love

yes that's a lovely crescent shaped sausage „ isn't it
a good moon shape
there's your drink
right
the sink
well if you've eaten all your food
you might end up sinking to the bottom of the bath
if you have that
right
this is some pickle
but wasn't the pickle I was looking for
oh dear
Thomas will you stop being naughty
and rude
there's no need for it
if your Daddy heard you say that now
what would happen Tom
excuse me it would
I don't think you would go to a toy shop
I certainly don't think he would buy you all the toys in the world
very cross with you
right
shall I tell you what this pickle's made from
ingredients
carrots
cauliflower
no
gherkins
marrows
they're not yuck
onions
rutabaga
whatever that is
well it might be I don't know what it is
tomatoes
and it's got sugar
vinegar
dates
you like dates
salt
apple
lemon juice
and garlic extract
you like garlic „ don't you
garlic bread
yum
all I can hear is you crunching on quavers
quavers is a name for musical notes as well
crotchets and quavers
so when you hear quavers
you can hear either you eating quavers
or quavers being played
eat nicely now please
the sun's come out again now
the sun's out again
I thought it was going to rain before „ didn't you
it was nice
and then it went rather dull
Purdie's still out
what do you mean goodq
what
does she disturb you when you're having your lunch
meow
she likes cheese
she would meow if she was hear with cheese
I don't think she likes quavers though „ do you
I don't think so
have a look at the list of ingredients
see on the front of a packet
of crisps or something like quavers
it tells you who makes them
and it gives you their name quaversq
a light potato snack
and then it gives you the flavor
which is cheese
and on the back
it gives you all sorts of information
like what's in them
ingredients
potato starch
vegetable oil
cheese powder
oh it's full of all sorts of stuff Thomas
rice flour soya flour salt yeast
onion powder pepper wheat flour
to name just a few
it's probably not very good for you at all
I'd better test one
it tells you the other things
that these people make as well
French Fries
those are nice
I love those french fries
they're like sticks
very tasty
MonsterMunch
what's Monster munch
I don't think we have them
have we
no
I don't know what Monster munch are
well are they like quavers
do they look like monsters
oh
monsters without feet
are you making that up
hm
sit still love please
beg your pardon
five nick a nick
what's five nick a nick
Thomas

I thought you were going to
I thought you were going to say knicknackpaddywack
stop it Thomas please
I don't like that
I would look silly
with nine lotsof knickers on my head „ wouldn't I
no
my bottom would get cold
if they were on my head
that's a silly thing to sing
remember that story about the train
with the trousers on it's funnel
which story was that
which train
it was the fat controllers trousers
but which was the engine
Gordon
Percy
I can't remember
one of the engines was a bit annoyed
because
well not annoyed because he just felt cold
he had a big funnel „ didn't he
and in winter
he saw all the passengers waiting on the platform
with scarves round their necks
and he thought hm that's what I want
a scarf for my funnel
and he kept saying
I want a I want a scarf
and one day
I don't know what happened
he was showing off a bit „ wasn't he
I think he useta come to the station
really quietly „ didn't he
he didn't useta peep his whistle
he useta come in very quietly
trying to surprise people
well one day he came in so quietly
that the two guards didn't see him
and they were crossing the platform
with
you know like we've just been playing
with your luggage cart
well they were crossing
not the platform the track
with a big luggage cart
with everybody's suitcases on it
and the train came in so quietly
they didn't see him
and he didn't see them
and boosh
he couldn't stop in time
and he hit the trailer
everybody's suitcases burst open „ didn't they
and everything fell out
and somebody must have had some jam
in the suitcase
because he had jam dripping down him
and the fat controller's suitcase burst open
and the fat controller's trousers flew in the air
and wrapped themselves
well
no
he wasn't
no
because they were in his suitcase at the time
it was a suitcase the train hit
didn't hit the fat controller
it hit his luggage
and suddenly the fat controller's trousers
from his suitcase
got wrapped round the funnel of the train
and then he realizes that

he wished he didn't have something on his funnel
because he felt really silly
the passengers were furious
the fat controller was furious
and the other trains laughed at him
because he looked so silly „ didn't he
wearing the fat controller's trousers round his funnel

wouldn't
yeah that's right
don't want all your dirty luggage
well not dirty luggage
dirty laundry
excuse me Thomas
what do you say
pardon
I know you burped
what will you say when you burp
Thomas
don't be naughty
well I've more or less finished grating now
that's the last of it
right
don't touch it
you've got your hand
well I tell you what
you hold your hand flat on there
hold it down really hard
don't take it off
and don't touch any part
of the grater
can you see
no
I'm not doing any more
oh
don't do that
right
was that exciting
watching cheese being grated
what a great idea
great stuff
isn't it
have you pinched some of my grated cheese
hm
I bet you won't want it in a minute
because I'm going to put some pickle on
on the bread now
and have a sandwich
you'll probably find you like it actually Tom
actually
no
the pickle's finished
that's the end of the jar
well I might as well use that bit of chutney up „ hadn't I
peach
have you
well that's very cheeky of you „ isn't it
and I've just ripped the bread
trying to put some margarine on it
tore a hole in the bread
so probably all the cheese will end up falling through
right
I had cheese and pickle the last time
and now I've got cheese and chutney on this one
and I made this chutney
so I know that peaches went in it
and vinegar
and sugar
and dates
and sultanas and raisins
there was nothing else
no fancy
preservatives
or funny names or anything
and boy it took ages to make that
masses of peaches
masses of ingredients
that big pan we borrowed from Nana
and by the time it had all cooked
for as long as it hadta
and boiled down
it didn't make that many jars „ did it
but it's lasted a long time
to make some more
I'll wait until the peaches
are really cheap in the supermarket
and then I'll buy lotsof punnets
and do it then
bread's made of bones
no
I think it's telling you on the packet
that the bread's got calcium in it
and calcium is good for your bones
calcium's a
you know like you have vitamin tablets in the morning
well calcium is something called a mineral
vitamins and minerals are very good for you
yes
are you not
why are you scared of Linda
you knocked a flower off
sour
I don't understand

I know you don't Thomas
why
no
no
why were you worried about Linda
oh there's onions in this chutney as well
I've just remembered because I've just seen some
do you want another sandwich then Thomas
you must eat
why are you worried about Linda
why are you worried about Linda

well a few minutes ago when I went to the door
to see envelope through
we saw Linda and she was very pleasant
didn't seem grumpy to me
well what have you done to Linda
why should you be nervous of Linda
what have you done
did you do something over the garden wall
have you thrown something from our side to to next door
have you
well I can't think of any reason then why you should be nervous of her
she certainly didn't seem cross
did she
oh dear
I've just glanced at that orange light
it's having a disco
flashing on and off
I shall have a breakdown over this equipment
oh it's lit up
it works when I look at it
are you
look at it behaving
misbehaving
oh quick just pinch a look
it
right
perhaps he's spilt something down it
do you think
he's probably been lifting somebody's rubbish up
and something wet or horrible in it
and it's gone down his front
oh I thought for a moment
they were going to leave that little boot's bag then
bye
can you see better from this side
that car won't be able to pass there „ will it
because the dustbin lorry's blocking the road
and it's on a bend
they're picking up outside Susan's house now „ aren't they
ohgosh the car's going to go for it
jolly good
well possibly the dustbin man's told him
that nothing's coming
because he'll be able to see round the corner
sounds like bottle's being thrown in „ doesn't it
can you see the crusher
and they actually didn't stack it up
outside of our house today
they stacked in on the other side
which I prefer
ooh there goes the crusher
look
they were
the men were sort of running along
holding their hands „ weren't they on the bin
oh blimey
we can't see it
but that was a big bang „ wasn't it
still hear it
oh look
there's another car
is that Georgia's Daddy
he must have been stuck
he wouldn't have been able to get past
right
come and rinse your hands after lunch please
well you shall go outside in a moment
just give your hands a little rinse
I can still hear the dustbin truck
going up round the street „ can you
just give your hands a rinse
oh I see
would you like some fruit
full up
well have some fruit later on this afternoon „ shall we
how does that sound

oh no
that's because you're not double jointed
like Billy is
right
I'll just finish my sandwich
no you're not
just a moment please
excuse me
look
that light is working again
no
it's not
not now
and you thought that was funny „ didn't you
a very interesting little song then Thomas
what were you singing a song about
the light
ah
excuse me before you give me a kiss
no
you've washed your hands
but what have you not wiped
you muck
well what had you not wiped
until you wiped it
on my nice clean blouse
ha
you mess mess pot
mess mess pot
mess pot
mucky what
he's a mess pot so we'll smack his bottom
he's a mess pot so we'll smack his bottom

oh yes we will
mess pot messy pot
pot smack your bum a lot

ha no
ah but mine's so
oh don't
mine's so fat
I can't really feel it

this little bum went to market
this little bum stayed at home
this little bum had roast beef
and this little bum had none
and this little bum went smack
smack all the way home
oh no
no
no
no
no
that's too hard
jump
right
oh no
I forgot to put something in the rubbish
yeah
you

see if we can catch up with them



I hope they do reverse back
excuse me
faster
it's for the biggest messy thing of all
in our house
I forgot to throw it away

right
is it
get down
are you going to do some tidying up now
well can you just wait a few minutes
we've only got a few minutes
yes

no
Thomas don't do that
well you know the men have given us a new bin bag
because they've collected the dirty one
well the new bin bag I shall put in this bin
for your next
don't go out
and then whatever
whatever rubbish I'd forgotten to put in that bin
I will be able to put in the new bag
pardon
well the truck fortunately isn't bashed „ is it
yeah but you were asking me what would happen
if I'd forgotten to put some rubbish out
well I would put the rubbish that I'd forgotten
into the wheelie bin bag in the bin
put it outside
and it would sit there for a whole week
and next monday when the dustbin men come along
and away it goes with any luck
that's the wrong foot Darling
I've still my lunch
we only got down from the table to see the dustbin truck
well I've put the kettle on
which means that from all the kettle sounds
well a truck
just a moment Thomas
I am eating my lunch
you'll wait
no
you shouldn't have got down yet
no
you'll hafta wait
I'm eating
well I'll tell you why they're hard to put on
because you haven't got any socks on
you've put a Wellie straight on to bare legs
you don't need Wellingtons
no
you've got
yeah because you've probably got them on too tight
the more you wear them
oh it's only a little mark Thomas
put your
if you put them on again
I can see where that little mark was
and we can put a plaster or something on the sandals
to stop it rubbing
you the thing is with those new sandals
you can adjust the strap
you can adjust the strap
so they're never too big or too small
for anybody providing they are the right size foot
you wore them all last summer
not them not the same ones
it's the same make
and they're fine
I don't think you'll get wellies on and off very easily
without socks Thomas
your sandals are just there
it only takes a moment to pop your feet in those
why
why am I standing here
I don't know
look
can you see that white pussy cat in Kathleen's bedroom window
well you look
to the bedroom window up there
right
well
that's a white cat
they've got a white cat and a ginger cat
pardon
well the ginger one's not there
but the white one's in the window
last night when you went to bed
I looked out of your window
and I could see there was a ginger cat
sitting outside their front door
and he looked really fed up
as if to say for goodness sake stop watching television and let me in
I'm outside your front door
I want letting in
I don't know
but if she is Thomas you don't go shouting
over the fence
don't
because listen
I wouldn't be very pleased
if I wanted a bit of peace and quiet in the garden
and some little boy kept coming up to the top of the slide
and shouting
Thomas don't disturb her please
practicing
your five
writing number five
do you want me to write one five for you to copy
oh mind
goodness

please can you not just look and concentrate a bit more
look what you're doing
right
so you've been told not to copy
no
but you perhaps you need something
to just glance at Darling
every now and again
well look
just have a glance at the number five for a minute
okay
I was only trying to help
alright
alright
well that's what I was saying
you know just let me show you
no
you're not
that isn't practicing
that isn't practicing
get a clean piece of paper
and just
fair enough
bye
grumpy child
well I think we'd better call this an end of the tape
