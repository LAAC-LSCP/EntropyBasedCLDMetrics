and that's the wall
and that's his hosepipe
with water coming out
look
and Thomas was thrilled when he got it
cause you're not really into soft toys
but you did like that „ didn't you

and the ambulance man came round one afternoon
with a picture for us

it was Manchester show again
and I was judging in the morning
and in the afternoon Thomas and I went
and we saw the same ambulance man
who said that's the little boy in the photograph

and they wanted to photograph him again
and I hadn't got the camera with us
so on Sunday we went to Boots in Stockport
and bought a new film and new battery
and we went back to the show
and the ambulance men took his picture
and so did the policeman
and tell Jeannine about the sirens on the ambulance
there were three different sirens „ weren't there
no
he explained that there's one traffic light
sorry one siren when you're driving
in ordinary traffic „ isn't there
and what was the other one for
yes that's right
when you're going through traffic lights there's a different one
and the other one
was when they were stuck behind somebody
who doesn't seem to know they're there
to get out of the way
and he was explaining about the stretcher „ wasn't he
and the chairs
well when people are poorly they put them in stretchers
they'd hafta go to the the hospital „ haven't they
and the ambulance that Thomas had his photo taken in last year
was called Bluey

and is in India „ isn't it
