one two three
how many have you got there

I can only see three
there should be six in there
but I can only see three
how about we find the other three
that's right
that's the yoghurt pot with a picture of James on it
and James is the engine with the driver who says help
that's blue
that's ThomasTheTankengine
yes

what about if we find the other three eggs so that we've six eggs in the eggbox
have a look in the basket and see if you can see any
that's another one
shall we put it in the eggbox
and that makes four eggs
more
that makes five eggs
and we just need one more
and I can see it there
that's a pear
it's a plum
that's a green apple
that's another green apple
they're both green apples
but they're different colored greens „ aren't they
what about finding the other egg for the eggbox
that's another pear
a strawberry
mm
an orange
that's Po
that's a red pear
oh you can see nine eggs „ can you
I can only see five
I'm hoping to soon see six in that box but I can only see five
what about finding the other egg

that's six eggs
one two three four five and six
now the eggbox is empty again „ isn't it
yes
it's empty
we'll fill it up again „ shall we

NinNin's in the cupboard „ isn't she
oh look
you've put all six eggs into the eggbox
what a clever boy
you carry them through into the kitchen
and look what Mummy as got
Mummy's going to put these eggcups onto the table
now you've got to be very careful with these because these break
because they're posh eggcups
that's right
you put an egg into each of those eggcups
you've actually got seven eggcups there
and you've only got six eggs
that's right
all the eggcups are different sizes „ aren't they
but they all fit in very nicely
yes
that's it
now we've got one eggcup without anything in
we've got seven eggcups and only six eggs
and you have a look at this very special eggcup
because this was given to us when you were christened
and it as got a picture of a rabbit on it
and it says
Peter sat down to rest
and then there's a picture of a watering can
and then it says
he was very damp with sitting in that can
that's a Peterrabbit eggcup
and you had a bowl and a plate and a cup and a mug to match
yes
now if I stand the yoghurt pots as well
and shall we see if we can put some fruit in the yoghurt pots
we'll sit the fruit in the yoghurt pots like we have in the eggcups
help
now look
the lemon looks small enough to go in a yoghurt pot
and the green grapes look small enough to go in a yoghurt pot
and that's a small pear
that goes in the yoghurt pot
and strawberry
that will go in the yoghurt pot
and so will the plum
and that green apple
that looks small enough to go in the yoghurt pot
perhaps you'll put the green apple in the yoghurt pot
and we'll take the strawberry out of the yoghurt pot and we'll put that in the other eggcup
yes
you've found some bananas
that's right
now we can always put the eggs back in the eggbox
so we can put the small fruit that we put in the yoghurt pots in the eggcups
look
plums
a plum
a lemon
a strawberry
some grapes
a pear
that's two pears
banana
and a slice of melon
and then in the larger yoghurt pots we can put the larger pieces of fruit
the orange
the red apple
the tomatoes
and the lemon
yes
now what are we going to put those into
grapes
because they're really quite big pieces of fruit so I don't think they're going to go into the pot „ are they

have a look in the cupboard and see what we've got
whoops

and you're dropping an egg in the bowl as well
that's right
we're taking the fruit out of the yoghurt pots putting it into the special PeterRabbit eggcup
and then you're dropping them from the eggcup into the bowl „ aren't you
the grapes in there
