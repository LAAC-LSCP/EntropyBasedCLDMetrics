who's here
the bin men lorry
what's happening
what's happening across the road
yes
the bin men
yeah
the bin men are carrying all the bags
are you going to wave at them
you can
you going to give them a wave
that's right
yeah
there are three men today doing the bags „ aren't there
and one driver
naughty ones
why are they naughty
oh a dirty
I thought you said it was naughty
a dirty bin bag lorry
does it smell disgusting
poo
it smells disgusting
it'll probably smell disgusting if it's full of dirty rubbish Thomas
isn't it
oh dear
what happened then
one man dropped a bin bag out of the lorry and it hit the other man on the back of the leg „ didn't it
ah they've driven off now
they only did two stops today
they stopped at our house and they stopped at Sue's house
where've they missed one
no
I don't think they've missed one Thomas
that's an empty dustbin
everybody puts bags out
but that house puts the dustbin out
so he as emptied the rubbish out of the dustbin but he as left the dustbin there
Fred's house
oh no
look we've got one in our tree
those are the new bags
those are the bags that they leave us so that we can put them in our bin
and next week those'll be the full bags that they take away
yes
there's one in Fred's tree
there's one in our tree
there's one in Grant's tree
look
can you see the one tied to his tree
and there's one on Sue's front door handle
can you see
on her white door
no
they've emptied what was in it into the back of the bin Thomas
it's just the empty bin they've left there
they have taken the rubbish
I promise you
they're quite early today „ aren't they
they've driven off
yes
yes
we'll see them next week „ won't we
what are you saying about Rachaels car
no dustbin on it
there isn't a dustbin on Rachael's car
no
yes
most of the leaves have blown off the trees „ haven't they
yes
look
AuntieLinda's tree has a lot of leaves on it
and ours do
but can you see over there
they're just branches and twigs „ aren't they
no leaves
no
well it's autumn
and in autumn the leaves fall off
you can still hear the lorry
yes
can still hear them
no press the buttons
did they not press the yellow button
did they
oh I wasn't watching
I didn't see
Peggy's daughter
yes
driving her little blue car
no daughter
yeah
no
that is Peggy's daughter
it was no Peggy in the car
it was just her daughter driving
she's driving very quickly „ wasn't she
is it
you can see some green leaves on the roses
can you see the pink roses
you can't
they're there look
through the window
pink roses
where the green leaves are
yes
that's right
you can see the roses
pink roses
Mummy carry
you want the tin up so you can see them better
you can see them more clearly now
no
you can't walk on the window ledge yourself
can you see down there
pretty pink roses
they're nice „ aren't they
they don't smell disgusting
roses smell beautiful
right
are we going to get ready now to go to Stockport
what can you see
you can see another pink rose
yes
they're beautiful „ aren't they
that's called a hydrangea
and that's dying off now
but those flowers were pink „ weren't they
they still are pink
but they're very crispy and dry now
I think we needta cut the heads off
you getting your footballs out to play with „ are you
the two balls are on the window ledge looking at the bin men
I was going to say
they won't see them now because the bin men have driven away „ haven't they
you can still hear them
yes
do you know where they'll be now
they'll be near Christopher's house „ won't they
Christopher and Craig's house
round the corner
oh you bouncing the balls
who fell down and bumped his head
oh I
you're talking about HumptyDumpty „ are you
HumptyDumpty as fallen down
the yellow one as fallen down
big truck
is that the rubbish truck
yes of course
it's the rubbish truck „ is it
oh the bin men have been „ haven't they
today
there's a picture of some can't call them anything
bin bag lorrys here „ aren't there
just looking to see if there was a better picture of one
but I don't think there is
look
this says work machine
busy bears
most of the bears are busy moving earth with their machines
but there is one bear who has a machine which does something else to the earth
which one is it
and what is he doing
which one is it
what is he doing
one wheel as gone
yes
there's an excavator
and a bulldozer
and a dump trailer and tractor
there's a big dumper truck here with a bucket loader
a tractor shovel
a tractor scraper
and I think it's this one
look
with a roller which smoothes the earth
yes
all the others are digging earth
moving earth
but this one look
is making the rough earth smooth
and on the next page we've got
cars and lorrys
down the street go the cars and lorrys
but look some of the cars don't have drivers
yes
it says which cars have no drivers
which one hasn't got a driver
that's right
the car that's on the back of the breakdown lorry
that has no driver „ does it
the car's empty
and what about these four cars on the car transporter
are they empty
big sausage roll shop
that's a
oh that's a delivery van
yes
now what's this Thomas
it's chocolates
it's an American book so they sometimes call things
something different from us
but it's a dust cart
we're really incorrect saying dustbin lorry „ aren't we
it is a dustcart or a refuse lorry
now I think there's a village here look
full of trains
look at all these trains
a lot of trains
this is a very nice book „ isn't it
I think it might have a picture of the city
and things that people do in towns
and I think one of those is collecting rubbish
shall we have a look
and see if we can see it
there's one there that says a drive in the country
but I don't think that shows a dustcart
oh this is the one that says in the city
another bus
yes
there's all sorts of things
there are vans
there's a delivery man
taxis
police cars
stations
trains
buss
but I
there's a police car
can you see the fire
and more trains
that's right
can you see a flashing light on top of the police car
oh
another one there
look
boats and ships
that's called a yacht
a yacht
no more reading
no more reading
alright
well
a mini bus
that's right
there's a picture of FatherChristmas „ isn't there
what are you saying about the mini bus
oh yes
and it's not a mini bus
that's called a milk float Thomas
I think sometimes on the television you see pictures
or when we're on the motorway you see very big milk tanker „ don't you
but the milkman who delivers the milk comes on an electric milk float
he comes very early in the morning
but sometimes we hear him come
so there's a big milk tanker
and then there are smaller milk floats
heard it open
what have we got here Thomas
has the book fallen down
what have we got here
these are all
they're bins
they're boxes
they're little bins
look
little bins
little bin
the lid as come off
but we'll put the bins on
they're very tiny swing bins „ aren't they
Mummy do it
look
we've got three bins
you can hold it
they're all white
they're all the same
now look
the Teletubbies
the Teletubbies are throwing out their rubbish
because it's Monday
what sort of things do you think the Teletubbies have got to throw away
that's right
you turn it round
it opens that way
where the flap is
now look
Dipsy as got some egg shell
because he as had a boiled egg for his breakfast
and he as got some egg shell
now we've got all sorts of different bins Thomas
we've got one bin where we can put rubbish in for the dustbin men to collect
shall we put things in this bin for the compost bin
we've got a compost bin outside „ haven't we
and any rubbish that Mummy as got from the kitchen
just a second
we put in the compost bin
and then shall we have this bin
the recycling bin for anything that we think somebody can use again
so what have we got in that one
the egg shell
that could go in the compost bin „ couldn't it
so what else
Lala as got a banana skin
now
does Lala wanna put that in the bin with the egg
and there's some orange peel there
that could go in the same bin as the banana skin and the egg „ couldn't it
who's putting it in the bin
Dipsy's putting that in the bin
oh very good
now do you know what'll happen to that Thomas
it'll go mushy and horrible
and then we'll put it on the garden
it'll make compost
oh now then
who has
Po has had a drink of cola
Dipsy
ah but I think Dipsy would be better putting it in that dustbin for the bin man „ don't you
that's right
you've got to press it down a little bit
and look
somebody as had some yoghurt for lunch
what shall we do with the yoghurt pot
that bin
that bin
now what about this
it's a bottle of milk
well I think that one
is it a plastic bottle or a glass bottle
a glass bottle
well in that case shall we put it in this bin
and then
but when we go to Tesco we can pop it in the recycling bins
you know how all the glass smashes
smash
so we've got the compost bin the rubbish bin and the recycling bin
what else have we got to throw away
oh there's a bit of fish there
a little bit of fish that they couldn't eat for supper
I think they'll put that in the dustbin „ don't you
oh you're putting it in the compost bin
okay
and what's this
it's a little bracelet
Smartie
oh that's not a Smartie
that's a little pendant „ isn't it
two dirty
well I think it's broken so shall we put in the bin for the dustmen
oh it isn't broken
look
it's in perfect
but it's far too big
it's far too big for the Teletubbies
is it broken
well I was going to say it's in perfect condition
it's just a little bit too big for the Teletubbies
so should we put that in this bin
and then the next time
do you remember the other day we had a bag through
that pink bag
and they were asking for donations so it could help the poorly animals
if we put it in this bin then the next time we get a bag like that we can give them this bracelet
because there's nothing the matter with it
it's just too big for the Teletubbies
and then they could sell it in the shop
and make money for the poorly animals „ couldn't they
what else have we got
oh we've got another drinks container
look
now that one can go in the rubbish bin „ can't it
we're not going to use that again „ are we
will it not fit
oh dear
now that's the top of an old hot water bottle
that's rubbish „ isn't it
and a button that as fallen off something
that's rubbish
and a little bit of a broken light switch
so who's going to throw that away
which of the Teletubbies is going to put that in the bin
Thomas has done it instead
that's okay
oh
dear
oh dear
Dipsy as spilt the pasta
oh Dipsy what are we going to do with you
yes
I think it ad better go in the
shall we sweep it up
look
using the dustpan and brush
would you like to sweep it up
sweep
I'll hold the dustpan and you get the brush
and you're putting it in the rubbish bin
that's right
because it as fallen on the floor „ hasn't it
so we can't eat it because it might be dirty
are you sweeping it into a pile
and it's going in the dustbin
you're making a good job of tidying up „ aren't you
Dipsy as fallen over
oh dear
I'll put
there we are
yes
Dipsy you watch Thomas
because Thomas is very busy tidying up „ aren't you
spilt it
who spilt it
Dipsy spilt it
and TinkyWinky spilt it
and Thomas is having to clean it up
oh dear
that's making extra work for you „ isn't it
do you mind
you've dropped one
you've dropped a piece
well never mind
we'll find it later
shall we pretend that that's something outside that as been spilt
and look
who's coming to help
a digger
yes
because you could put all that onto the digger
that's right
and it can go into the bin „ can't it
what's happening
what about TinkyWinky's leg
now shall we pretend that's a big skip
like we saw at the airport that day
do you remember
lovely
so the digger as tipped all that into the skip
oh dear
what's that
oh there's something else spilt on the floor now
they look like raisins or something „ don't they
but they've been on the floor
so they'll hafta go in the bin
oh what a lot of things
watch out Dipsy
big digger coming
is it going into the bin
oh that's going in the bin as well
oh
now the dumper truck is coming along Thomas
with
well we'll use paper clips but we'll pretend it's something that needs to go in the bin
what shall we pretend it is
pretend it's money
right
I don't think we'll be putting money in the bin „ would we
what shall we say it is Thomas
shall we just call it rubbish
yes
we'll just say it's rubbish
all done now
sweeping up
you've tidied up „ have you
right
no
these are paper clips
just one moment
there's a nice purple one there
look
all these bright colors
look
it's coming along in the dumper truck
now do you think the dumper truck wants to empty it into the big
into the big skip
you're shuting it „ are you
oh has he just dumped them on the floor
rather than putting them in the bin
so is somebody going to hafta come along and sweep them up
well how about putting your yellow helmet on
your hard hat
there you are
what's happening
no fit
yes it is
now which bin would you like to put those in
in that bin
right
when Daddy throws away his newspaper we put that in the recycle bin „ don't we
and then the white van comes on Tuesdays „ doesn't he
and picks up all the paper
do you remember
it's the rubbish man on Monday taking all the rubbish
and it's the recycle man on a Tuesday „ isn't it
taking away paper and cardboard
and things like bottles and jars we take to Tesco „ don't we
and put them in the big bins there
and if we've any old clothes or shoes or books things like that we're always getting charity bags
people asking us for things we don't want
so we put them in the charity bag
you've dropped another one
do you remember we saw somebody sweeping something up the other day
on Tuesday morning
as we were walking to playgroup
do you remember those men
they were dressed in green
they looked like the bin men
and they had a machine that was blowing all the leaves off the pavement onto the road
it was like a big vacuum cleaner
he was holding it in his hand
and all the leaves were blowing off the pavement onto the road
and then somebody else came along and swept up all the leaves
and they put them in the back of the lorry „ didn't they
and carried them away
because when leaves get wet they're very slippy to walk on
so obviously they're clearing the path so that nobody has an accident
you've emptied them all up
shall we get some more rubbish to put in the bins
what shall we get this time Thomas
there's another yoghurt pot there
that can go in the bin
oh no
don't squash it
because it's
no
don't squash it
because it's the one of the nice ThomasTheTankEngine ones
it'll just fit in the bin without being squashed „ won't it
there we are
you want it in the bin lorry again
and there's some empty containers there
some more empty food containers
they can go in the bin lorry
in the bins
why are you hiding that
the big digger's coming now
now what do you think the big digger as got
I think he as got something actually in a bin bag
what can we use for leaves
oh I know
some cones
we'll put some cones in there
and then they've swept all the leaves and the cones with the big blowing machine
they blow them onto the road from the footpath
and then somebody as come along and swept them up
and put them in a bin bag
and the digger man is coming
look
with
oh it's such a big load Thomas
bigger than the digger
I'm going to hafta take
perhaps we'll just put one cone in there „ shall we
look there we are
he can come with a cone in his truck
how's that
will it not go in there
oh I think it will if you try
oh I see
you're putting it in your BobTheBuilder hat „ are you
right
shall we drive them back again
for him to pick up another cone
ah but this is in a bin bag
that's in
that's in a proper bin bag „ isn't it
you wanna open it
oh but when the bin men come to us on Mondays we've got all our plastic bags like this outside „ don't we
and they just put the whole bag into the bin „ don't they
they don't open it to see what's in it
would you like it open
or shall we leave it as it is
because it might be something nasty in there
ugh
ugh we don't know what's in there „ do we
I think we'll leave it as it is
now there's a lot of tidying up to be done „ isn't there
what sort of rubbish is that Thomas
it's what rubbish
pasta rubbish
oh it's the pasta that we spilt on the floor „ isn't it
how many bins do we have in our house
one two three four five
oh I see
you've suddenly broken into the nursery rhyme
one two three four five
once I caught a fish alive
six seven eight nine ten
then I let him go again
why did you let him go
because he bit my finger so
which finger did he bite
this little finger on my right
when we were in Spain we saw the digger
not the digger
the dustcart go every day „ didn't we
do you remember
they useta sweep the footpaths and the road
and they useta empty all the rubbish
it was very clean „ wasn't it
what else happens to some of the things that we don't want
things like little bits of bread that you don't wanna eat
we throw them outside for the birds to eat „ don't we
and the squirrel
so we try and use the rubbish „ don't we
and empty boxes and packets you usually play with they're falling to bits
gosh
that is a big load
oh
a big big load
is that like the man at the airport
he drives round collecting all the rubbish
and then he drives to the loading bay where all the skips are
and he takes all the rubbish he as collected into the skip
leave it down the road
can I take the lid off for you
there we are
the bin lid as come off
oh
oh what a lot of mess
somebody's really going to have his work cut out now „ isn't he
cleaning that lot up
and all there as well
oh
goodness me
we've got a bin in the kitchen that we put rubbish in
and Mummy as got a little one on her worktop
one of these in fact
that we put things for the compost like tea bags and banana skins and apple peel and potato peel
egg shells
and then we've got a bin in the bathroom „ haven't we
and then we've got two bins in your bedroom
because you've got a nice wastepaper bin that we put rubbish in
but you've also got that very smart bin
that we useta use for your nappies
do you remember that bin
I might go and get that in a minute
it's a long time since we've used that
and then Mummy and Daddy have a bin in their bedroom
and there's a bin in the spare room
but we don't really use that
and on the landing we have a bin
and in that we've put newspapers
when Daddy as read his newspapers
I was going to say Daddy uses it but Daddy doesn't do it
Mummy does it
puts all the old newspapers in the bin on the landing
and then at the end of the week when the recycling men come I empty them all out into a big white sack
and the recycling men take them
and we've got another bin in the entrance hall
and that's where we put all the magazines and things that we haven't finished with
but they're not really for throwing out
it's just we use the bin to store them in
so haven't we got a lot of dustbins
I think you're so engrossed in emptying your rubbish and collecting it you haven't really got time to talk to me
so people come into our house to collect things Thomas
include the dustman and the recycling people
and anybody who comes to pick up these bags
look
there's a pair of shorts here of yours
red shorts
that you've worn for two years
but they're really too small now
so I think we'll fold those up nicely
and the next time we get a charity bag shall we put those in there
and we've got other people who bring things to the house
we've got the postman
he brings things
what does the postman bring
he posts letters through our door
and parcels
and then we have the milk man
what does he bring
he brings milk
and what else
eggs and cheese
and he brings fruit juice if we want it „ doesn't he
and who else
the paper boy
what does he bring
bring letters
he brings newspapers „ doesn't he
and magazines
and then we have
oh we have other people calling occasionally who drop things off like magazines and letters and leaflets „ don't we
so lotsof people delivering things and people taking things away
this is the very special bin from your bedroom
now you've probably not seen me using this
but I useta use this when you were a baby
and I don't know how much you remember
now because you're not potty trained and you've still got some
we've still got some nappies „ haven't we
and they're still in the bin here that we needta throw away
so look
shall I show you what we useta do
this is one of your nappies
fold it up tight Thomas
and then we take
we lift up the pink lid
take that top off
we pop the nappie in there
push it down
and then we take this lid again
look
we twist it round
I can't remember how much we take it round
something like one and a half turns
the nappie as gone
can you see if we've something else to put in the bin
look
there's something
more rubbish there
wrapped up
we'll put that in there
push it down
put this lid on
right
do you wanna turn the wheel round on the lid
turn that round
that's right
turn it round
all the way
that's it
and then at the end of the week or when the bin was full Mummy opens the bottom and pours it out
and look
all your nappies are stored in this special bag
and it smells nice
can you smell that there
now that smells lovely
that doesn't smell like pongy rubbish „ does it
it's a good job we did that because that actually is the end of the bag Thomas
it doesn't smell like nasty rubbish to me that
it smells like lovely clean fresh smell
and by doing that we've found some more rubbish „ haven't we
because the container's empty now
and I'm struggling now with this because I can't remember how to empty it
you're very quiet Thomas
are you just such a busy boy
so that's a special bin
I think actually we can wash that up
and perhaps put it in
yeah
ohgosh
you got more rubbish
oh
look
and there's some more cones there
they need putting somewhere
excuse me
were you copying Mummy
sneezing
Mummy's just going to wash her hands now
because I've been touching those nappies „ haven't I
but when you were a baby Thomas
that bin we useta use it several times a day
and it never really seemed full because your nappies were so small
but as you got bigger your nappies got bigger
and we soon hadta empty it a lot more
and now we don't really use it at all because we use those little nappie bags „ don't we
is this a nappie bag here
what color is it
orange
and that smells nice as well
you smell that
that doesn't smell like nasty dirty rubbish „ does it
that smells beautiful and fresh and clean
shall I tip it out Thomas
there you are
that's a bit easier to get to „ isn't it
do you wanna wear your hat
there you are
put your yellow helmet on
I don't think the refuse men wear hats „ do they
when the men came this afternoon did they have hats on
did they
I can't remember
FiremanSam
I don't think they were wearing firemen's hats „ were they
oh have you found the yoghurt pot
has it got a picture of Haroldthehelicopter on it
oh yes
so it has
and Gordon
yes
that's Gordon
the blue engine
is that what Gordon says
poop poop
yes
ThomasTheTankEngine and friends yoghurt
it says what color is the stripe on Haroldthehelicopter
Haroldthehelicopter is a white helicopter „ isn't he
but he has a stripe
there
what color's the stripe
red
that's right
let's have a look
there must be an answer somewhere
yes
it says the answer is red
well done Thomas
why are TinkyWinky and Lala riding in the dumper truck
it is quite funny
have they worked so hard clearing up all the rubbish that they're having to have a lift back in the dumper truck
aren't there a lot of things to tidy away
there's the brush
you'd like the brush to sweep it up
there you are
you're very good Thomas
at tidying away like this „ aren't you
you're sweeping up all the rubbish
and you're putting it in the dumper truck to take it to the skip
but when it comes to putting toys away at the end of playtime you don't really wanna do that „ do you
why not
because you're such a clever boy tidying away „ aren't you
your little friend Molly started school in September
Molly
and her teacher said if ever she wants somebody
AuntiePattie
no
it's AuntieSarah
AuntieSarah's little girl's called Molly
and Molly's school teacher told Molly's Mummy that if ever she wants somebody sensible to tidy away quickly she always asks Molly
because Molly enjoys tidying up
she does it properly and she does it quickly
doesn't make a fuss
Molly loves everything to be tidy „ doesn't she
so at the end of playtime are you going to start putting your toys away
we could pretend it's bin bag time „ couldn't we
at the end of playtime
you're very good at tidying away as long as somebody's helping you „ aren't you
you enjoy that
but I don't think you like it if Mummy just says rightq
tidy up Thomas
but at the end of bathtime you're very clever
at the end of bathtime you always pull the plug out
and you put all your toys away in the net bag „ don't you
what a funny noise
oh do you know what that is
that's your tummy rumbling
did it feel funny as well
well I heard a noise
and I didn't know what it was
that funny noise is coming from under you jumper
and under your vest
and inside of your tummy
because your tummy's telling you
I heard a noise
is your tummy telling you it's hungry and it's wanting something to eat
you heard a noise that the ginger cat said
I think it was a noise coming from inside your tummy
saying Thomas I'm hungry
please can we have something to eat
would you like something to eat
it's not going to be tea time for a while though „ is it
what a lot of diggers
yes
do you think the men have worked really hard this afternoon
picking up all the rubbish
the big one's going
where's the big one going to
to collect the rubbish
is it collecting rubbish from the yard
sometimes I feel very sorry for the bin men Thomas
because they got a wet and cold day when they come „ isn't it
and it's not pleasant
and yet other times they come in the summer when it as been really hot and we say that's not nice for them either
JakeKelly
JakeKelly bought you that digger „ didn't he
for your birthday
your first birthday
was the digger man actually pushing the big skip
yes
you can't put any rubbish in the dumper truck because who's sitting in the dumper truck
Lala and Po
it's Lala and TinkyWinky
what on earth are they doing sitting in there when there's work to be done
aren't they silly
oh dear
no
don't bang on the table Thomas
you're brushing Mummy's arm
oh
are they very dirty
oh that tickles
that tickles
tickles
shall I brush Thomas's hand and arm
does that tickle
ah no
ah don't be rough
just be gentle
brush Mummy's jumper
oh not with that brush
you've been using that brush to sweep all that rubbish up
and now you're brushing my hair
and your hair
what sort of brushes do we have Thomas
we have
what happened
that's just Mummy's hand
the skin's not as nice and soft and smooth on my hands as it is on yours
this is a washing up brush that you've been using as a rubbish brush „ haven't you
a sweeping brush
but we have hair brushes
and toothbrushes
Purdie has a brush
a washing up brush
a little brush
a hand held brush that goes with the dustpan and brush
and then we've got
oh
a big brush for the garden for sweeping up leaves
and then we've got a medium sized brush for sweeping floors
and do you remember when we talked about foxes
foxes have really big bushy tails
and they're called brushes
look
there's a fox
isn't that funny
in this book that we've got here
there's a picture of a fox
can you see his huge tail
it's a bit like Purdie's „ isn't it
Purdie as got a very big tail
yes
look
actually there's
now this is a nice page
in this
in this book there's a page called cleaning up time
each of the animals has a job to do to make everything tidy around the house
what do you think each animal is about to do
what as the bear got in his hand
he as got a sponge and some cleaning powder
so he's obviously going to clean something „ isn't he
and the fox with the big brush is carrying a bucket
but he as spilt some water
luckily he as got a mop in the other hand so he can mop it up
yes
he has got dirty feet „ hasn't he
and look the pussy cat as got some glue in her hands
so she must be going to mend something
and who's this
more dirty feet
they've all got dirty feet
yes
well the elephant's holding a dustpan and brush
look
he's going to do some sweeping like you
and the pig's carrying some wastepaper
she's only going to put that in the recycle bin
not in the ordinary bin
that's an octopus
now the octopus is using all his hands
to sew a torn bedsheet
look
Wellington boots
right
so I think the teddy with the cleaning powder and the sponge is going to wipe up these paw prints on the wall „ do you
look at those muddy footprints
yes
ah now the fox with the mop and bucket I think is going to mop up where the tap as leaked
because look
there's a picture here of a leaking tap
the pussy cat with the glue
what do you think she's going to do with the glue
ah
there is a big mess
look
because there's a vase here
with a chip in it
so she's taking the glue to mend the chipped vase
the piggy's taking the wastepaper to this pig here
who's pulling a cart load of old magazines
can you see them all piled up
and there's a little mouse holding a coat hanger
and there's a pile of coat hangers here
and it says don't you think some of them should be thrown in the dustbin
there's the dustbin
the octopus who is sewing the torn bedsheet
there's actually a clothes rail there Thomas
the elephants are hanging up the clothes things
the elephant
oh what a big elephant
he's holding a dustpan and brush
and look
in the fireplace there's all the ashes after the fire as died down
so I think he's going to sweep those ashes up and perhaps put them in the dustbin
and the
look
there's a little mouse
holding the book and carrying it too
the book case
and there's one more thing that needs tidying
look at this table
what as happened to the table
what as happened to the table
one leg as fallen down
and so look there's a little character over here
I'm not quite sure what he is
whether he's a squirrel
he as got a wrench in his hand
ah no
perhaps the wrench man is going to sort out the leaking tap
oh Thomas
there's really so much to do I can't tell
yes
ah it perhaps it's the man with the bag
that's a badger with a bag of nails and a hammer
he must be going to mend the table
you wanna find the page with all the trains
there we are
picture of the trains
oh it's not a snotsnot Thomas
it's a pig
Toby
where's Toby
that's right
there's all sorts of trains
look
these are like Toby
they're goods trains
they carry things like coals
and boxes
and this
this is a nice train
it's a diesel locomotive
with a passenger train
look at the coaches
and a buffet car
a buffet carriage
that's right
you can go there and get a sandwich and a cup of coffee
and look
there's a signal here
and a level crossing there
when Dimitra comes and plays with her train set you have signals „ don't you
and those nice gates and things
the barriers
that's the words I'm looking for
barriers lift up and down
so that the trains can go through them
what's the train doing
can you see a picture with a mobile shop
it's a very nice book they've got you Thomas
it shows all sorts of things „ doesn't it
ladder
a pan
was that a picture of somebody's house
and it showed a little rabbit in the kitchen
a kite
you've found a picture of a kite
we were talking about kites before
we think
is there sunshine
what can you see on the the cover of the book
is there a fire engine
yes
FiremanSam
Thomas they're not snotsnots they're pigs
I think you're calling them snotsnots because you've heard the word snout
and you're getting terribly mixed up „ aren't you
you might be thinking of
snouts
yes
but they're called pigs
you know that
