round and round
the wheels on the bus go round and round
all day long
what can you see on this picture
it's a yellow taxi by the looks of it
that's quite funny you should

it's quite funny you should be MissusMayberry to pick her
do you remember
that we ad been reading a book
yes
we ad been reading
we ad been reading a book
about yellow taxis „ hadn't we
and I said oh we don't tend to get yellow taxis in this country it's in America
and we went to pick MissusMayberry up from the station and what did we see
three yellow taxis all in one day
right the next
verse
the doors on the bus go open and shut
open and shut
well you pull that tag
that man's about to get on the bus
look what as he got in his hand
a guitar
a guitar
yes please
oh thank you
the doors are opening
now let this little girl get off first
what as she got in her hands
looks like she as got a toy bus on a string
one of those pull along toys
and there's a lady sitting on the bus with a canary in a cage look
oh yes sorry
just let me get on
I think that gentleman with the guitar's before me „ isn't he
or shall I get in first
okay
excuse me man with the guitar
up the steps I go
one two three
now the driver doesn't look as if he's interested in taking my money „ does he
his head looking straight ahead „ isn't he „ his face
who do we know with guitars
yes
quick there
no
there's other people queuing up for the bus look
there's a lady here with a baby in a sling
and look at this lady in the back
she's rushing to catch the bus with her shopping
what as she got in her bags
oh poor lady
and she as got bananas and it looks like a cauliflower or a lettuce

is he rushing for the bus as well
everybody's on the last minute today „ aren't they
what
number three
what number buss do we catch
yes
course you can
oh are you
thank you
where's the bus going to
is it
well it's usually the forty two we get to Stockport „ isn't it
when your clock goes to the bottom it'll stop
right
where do you think the little girl's going with the bus
is she going to Stockport Cheshire „ is she
is she going to do some shopping in Stockport

not the wipers
well I tell you what it's a wet it's a wet day because have you seen that poor person there waiting for a bus with her red umbrella
she has got splashed „ hasn't she
it's the windows of the bus go up and down
I would imagine that if it's a hot day and it's raining people inside the bus are getting a bit it's hot in here
they
this is the problem
everybody on the bus is probably very hot because there are a lot of passengers so they open the window and then it's raining
and the rain is coming in and splashing them
so they're going to hafta close them again
is it a sunny day
ah but on this page it says the wipers on the bus go swishswishswish
so if they're going swishswishswish I don't think it can be sunny „ can it
it it could still be sunny and rainy at the same time „ couldn't it
and then what happens
and what happens when the sun comes out and the rain starts
what happens in the sky
what do we see in the sky
the sun's shining and it's raining
how
is it

HaroldtheHelicopter

CrankytheCrane and a boat
and that looks like
a carriage
is it Annabel or Clary
Thomas's carriages
oh right
who's this
is this Toby
number seven
but I really didn't know there was an engine called Ben
I wonder if Ben knows there's an engine called Ben
Ben
Ben Berry
your friend Ben
Ben and Charlotte
I was just saying I wonder if he knows
he's bound to know „ isn't it
how've you got all that
oops a daisy
fat controller

what as happened to Bertie
oh no
steady darling
you're having an accident now
you're falling off „ aren't you
oh is
perhaps Thomas
the crane
CrankytheCrane
let me read what it says at the bottom
it is another busy day at the station
passengers have been visitting
well instead of passengers it must be a man and a lady
what shall we call them
Harold
well Harold's the helicopter
let's give the gentleman and the lady a name
think of a lady and a gentleman you know
Kiera's Daddy and Mummy
okay
it is another busy morning at the station
Kiera's Daddy and Mummy have been visitting the fat controller who is their friend
now they ready to go home but there are no trains
Bertie is not there either
the fat controller to help look for Thomas and his friends
to look for Thomas and his friends
there is a sheep on the line so no trains can get through
is this Percy
Percy is hurrying to help and before you can say chufchuf the sheep is back in the field
and Kiera's Mummy and Daddy are brought safely by Thomas and one of his carriages
which might be Annie or it might be Clarabel
Clarabel
so
right so let's start again
another busy day at the station
Kiera's Mummy and Daddy
where are Kiera's Mummy and Daddy going to wait
you put the sticker where you think they should be waiting
do you
do you not think they're going to be waiting at the station
the station's there
oh look there's a lamp post there
shall we leave that on the platform
didn't realize that was a sticker
they've been visitting the guard who's their friend
there's the guard look
are they
now they're ready to go home but there are no trains
BertietheBus is not there either
where's Bertie
where's the sticker with Bertie
there he is
the fat controller asks HaroldtheHelicopter to help look for Thomas and his friends
where's HaroldtheHelicopter
have we got that sticker
no
oh that must be one of the ones that are missing because there are a few that are missing
oh no there is a sheep on the line
let's find a sheep and pop it on the line
ah there are the sheep look
where
oh guess what
there isn't just one sheep
there's another sheep
it does sound like a firework that „
they start very early round here the fireworks
there's going to be a big crash because of the sheep on the line
ThomasTheTankEngine as bashed onto the station door
it's not very good „ is it
oh it says Percy's going to help and before you can chuffchuff the sheep is back in the field
and the passengers
that's Kiera's Mummy and Daddy are brought home safely by
Thomas and
Clarabel or Annie
there's a little man Thomas
where do you think he's fishing
do you think he's sitting on that big rock fishing
oh is that because of the wind
goodness me
now shall we put a nice street lamp there
because then it will light the way for passengers waiting at the station
and also so that the guard
is it a very windy day then „ is it
at the station
what sort of thing is this Thomas
is this a storage tank
has it got water in it
or
what's that used for
I don't know either but it looks like it's a very important part of the
ah I see
is that somewhere near the stream then
and it sucks the water up from the stream
and then what does it do
do you think they use it for washing the the carriages
well we better put that
Thomas
very late
I don't know
oh
gosh look there's some boulders on the line now
and a lamp post
all these things have blown down
can you see the little man in his boat
is he sailing to the river
oh no

the man sailing in the river
the wind blew him on the track as well
gosh no wonder the poor passengers are having problems getting home
oh no
oh dear
and what about the guard here waving his flag
where's he
he could be here
oh no
let me guess
the engine called Ben
he fell on as well
and there's only one engine left Toby
and let me guess what happens to him
oh no
he as landed on top of all the others

oh dear
CrankytheCrane came
ah I bet he lifts them all up „ doesn't he
is he going to rescue everybody
oh no
and do you know while all this is happening
there is a little man sitting on the rock fishing
and the wind as not affected him at all „ has it
what's that that as just blown off now
that's one of the trucks „ isn't it
the coal trucks
but the little man is still fishing
oh no
nobody can help
oh dear
a sheep that looks like it's upside down
do you know what happens to sheep Thomas
if you see sheep in the field on their back
you've got to turn them round the right way
cause sheep can't get up on their own
and if ever you see a sheep lying in the field upside down you must shoutq
because they need help to turn over
they can't turn over
you would like a drink
yes
in a few minutes we can have a drink
can you see the big ladders leading up to Cranky
I would imagine
yes
I would imagine the step ladders go from the ground up to CrankytheCrane's cab
the crane is such a long way up the driver needs to climb into the cab „ doesn't he
the legs of the crane are a long way from the floor
and then when the driver's in the cab the crane part goes up a long way above the cab „ doesn't it
oh you can be driver and I can sit next to you and tell you what we hafta lift up
right crane driver there's an awful mess
we had strong winds in the night and all sorts of things have blown onto the line
I think we need help to lift ThomasTheTankEngine up
you lift him
one at time cause we can only manage one thing
up he goes
up
ohgosh
you're a strong crane because apart from ThomasTheTankEngine we've lifted up Annie or Clarabel and the big water storage tank with a man on the side
what else have you lifted up Cranky
oh we've rescued Toby look
what else have you rescued
ah who's this
Ben
the engine called Ben that we knew nothing about
ah who's this
one of Thomas's coaches
BertietheBus
your favorite
oh what about the little man fishing
are you
right we've rescued the man fishing and one of the lamp posts
there's still another lamp post lying on the line
the sheep seem alright „ don't they
they don't seem to have affected
well the man with the boat
yes he needs rescuing I think
thank you
is it Isabelle's Daddy
I thought it was Keira's Mummy and Daddy
but it's Isabelle's Daddy „ is it
what's Isabelle's Daddy called
DaddyRod
did you see DaddyRod today
did you talk to him
oh
they can't
they have just rescued by Cranky
this is a favorite saying „ isn't it
do you know what
no Thomas
everything blew away
do you remember that story we useta read
Henry in the forest
that was one of my favorites
I can't really remember it but it was something to do with all the engines
were all the engines asleep in the engine shed
at the end of a busy day
and Henry particularly loved the forest „ didn't he
because his journey home was through the forest looking at all the trees
and as the engines were in the engine shed listening to the wind whistling outside
what sort of noise was it making

he was saying I hope the trees haven't blown down in the forest
and sure enough the next morning the trains all got up and Henry's driver saidq
there is leafs and twigs and branches everywhereq

Henry was so upset „ wasn't he „ when he saw the damage that the wind had done
but anyway they managed to clear the line and before long lotsof new young trees were planted
and Henry was ever so excited because as he drove along the country lanes
he could see
all the new trees growing up „ couldn't he
he could watch them growing
do you remember that story
