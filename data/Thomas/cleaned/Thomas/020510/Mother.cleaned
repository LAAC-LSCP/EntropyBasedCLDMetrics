I thought at first you were talking about the Archers
the little girl who as been scalded
but you're pointing to your head and saying like that
and what happened at the Christening yesterday the vicar put some water on Abigail's head
and she started to cry so I think you must have thought the water was hot that he was using but it wasn't hot Thomas
it was cold water
but she's only a little baby „ isn't she
and she was asleep
and it can't have been very nice for her being asleep
and then suddenly being woken up with somebody putting cold water on her head
so he didn't burn her
he didn't use hot water but she didn't like it „ did she
it was a bit of a shock
hello Purdie
