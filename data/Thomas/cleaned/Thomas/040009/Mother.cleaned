use that one
we'll move the chairs round love
Purdie has been a little bit sick „ hasn't she
pardon
what I'll do is swap the chairs round that'll be the easiest thing
put that chair there
are you saying hello to Jeannine
let's just watch that orange light is it okay this morning
right

tell you what we'll do

right
in that case I'll
just let me have a listen and see what it's sounding like
when I can get hold of these headphones
quite thin these wires „ aren't they
have a little listen and if it's breaking up and if the sound's not properly
running through then I'll stop it and we'll have a little look and see what's happened

just be careful son alright
alright that'll do Thomas thank you
right
can you just go over there because I can't really tell whether we can just hear you because you're standing right next to me
right
say something now then
I think that's alright
yes
that seemed okay
you hurt yourself chair
let's have a look
oh just now
have you just done that
right
there you are sit down sweetie
no darling you're going to be
come on don't be such a wimp
I called you sweeties as in sweetheart
did you
I'm sure you'll survive
sit down
no
you don't need a sweet to cheer you up
just going to get a tissue
oh the tissue box is empty Thomas
a landrover broke in
what do you mean a landrover broke
broke in
what do you mean the landrover broke in
both those trees
oh it's a reflection
I see what you mean from the glass
I can see the reflection of a landrover
I see what you mean a landrover broke in
you mean instead of there being a landrover parked on the road
it looks like there's a landrover parked in our dining room because of the reflection
I wondered what you meant

and that's when I stopped to have a look I blocked it
it stopped shining „ didn't it
has it gone now
oh no it's still there
I wasn't quite sure what you meant
you knew I couldn't see a landrover inside
no
Thomas you don't need a sweet to cheer you up let's have your breakfast
no
but it won't cheer you up Thomas
and you'll end up losing all your teeth
what milky one
I don't actually know what milky chocolate one is
what now
it does course it does
chocolate's a sweet
oh that reminds me I just needta Thomas
pardon
right
just be careful with the tea
right
would you like to eat
oh Thomas you are a little bit fussy this morning „ aren't you
what tea
why
what's it got in it
it's got what in it
what do you mean a little light
oh no not the bubbles I don't know what it is
a light
Thomas
no

what's
oh I see
well I think it's safe if it's only a reflection that's in my cup of tea
I thought you meant the bubbles needed rinsing
when I wash up I always rinse the pots before putting them on the drainer
I wash them in soapy water then I rinse them under the tap
then I leave them to drain or dry them straight away
and I never let
I always rinse my pots always rinse the teapot yet when I pour tea out of the pot look
you get these tiny bubbles around the edge
they're gradually popping away though „ can you see
just you watch this
watch it closely because it is
and they don't seem to be moving now „ do they
no don't do it Thomas I'll have a mouthful and see if I can drink them
I can't
very strong that tea I forgot I made it
right
you've your juice and I've got my tea so what are we going to have some toast or some cereal
would you like some cereal
I don't really want Honeyloops they're too sweet for me Thomas
would you like Honeyloops
yes okay
would you like some milk with them
you know the cereal I like „ don't you
oops they've just gone a bit sticky in the box I'll just hafta shake them up
alright this'll make a noise now
there I've given the box a shake up
right
don't pour too many please
you eat what you pour because if you don't pour very many you'll go hungry if you pour too many you'll be there till lunchtime eating
now I like these and but I'm going to have milk with them
huh
I like milk on cornflakes but it's the only cereal I like milk with
I either have fruit juice yoghurt or I don't bother
but if we were going to have this it means we can't talk very well because we'll be too busy chomping away


don't use your fingers it's not good to
there you are alright I'll give you some milk
oh that light I'm sure I've just seen it go on
I wonder why it does it because it's working
I'm looking at it now and it's working
now I've got some nice fresh milk here for your cornflakes
thought you wanted milk
did you not
oh
I thought when I asked you before I said would you like milk you said yesq
no
why don't you want milk
come on Thomas
just cause you split don't be silly you can have milk
well occasionally you spill your juice but it doesn't stop you having juice „ does it
it doesn't
come on
well don't be worried about spilling
have some milk if you want some milk
well milk's good for you Thomas
oh you are awkward
come on you can have milk
all you hafta do is just be careful when you're eating „ don't you
yes
well I'm having some of this yoghurt because I think that needs using up
would you like some yoghurt
no thank you
you're a bit grumpy
looks like glue „ does it
it's greek yoghurt it's quite thick „ isn't it
it's not a pouring kind of yoghurt
I'm really looking forward to this
I haven't actually love
no
when we go out later on we can get some yoghurt

look got yoghurts in the fridge cause we needta go shopping later
we haven't got many things in
will you remind me to buy some teabags as well please
we've always got spare teabags
in the top of that big cupboard there's a big tartan tin
do you know what I mean by tartan
I'll show you
tartan is a fabric
or at least a pattern of a fabric
can you see that tin up there the checked one
scottish people
you see men in kilts „ haven't you men in skirts
or they're made of tartan which is not a fabric it's sort of a thick woolly blend made of wool
and it's different colored checks and crosses stripes and things and each family has a different tartan
her name's Anderson
and there's a tartan called the Anderson tartan
so whenever she gets a kilt or anything tartan she always goes for a certain color
I don't think there's a Lastname tartan but pretend there was a Lastname tartan then we would go for a different tartan a different color
the other day when Grandad was here he said have you any more teabags and I said yes in the tartan tin
and he topped up the little pot by the kettle with the teabags from the tartan tin but now the the pot near the kettle's nearly empty
so unless we've more in the tartan tin we needta buy more teabags
or we won't be able to have cups of tea in the morning
you don't mean that
do you mean that
right
I don't mind drinking water but I couldn't drink that
I don't like particularly
I don't wanna be any bigger Thomas I could do with being a bit stronger
I don't wanna get any bigger
David's what machine
exercise machine
what did you call it at first all machine
mm
do you
is it like a rowing machine
mm
that's very exciting
mm
no I'm a bit naughty I don't do any exercise like that
I walk miles every day and I run up and down stairs lotsof flights of stairs
but don't really do a lot of exercise and I ought to because I really put on weight
since I had before I had you I useta be very slim
exercise machine
I'll try
I have been on one before
in fact we've got an exercise bicycle in our bedroom
it's where
yes
just let's these a minute
mm
it has a seat
oh yes I know
mm
that's
Thomas
Nana and Granddad useta have an exercise bicycle
I don't know whether they've still got it „ have they
they bought one a while ago for a wedding anniversary or a Christmas present or something
and you know the room at Nanna's which you decorated with blue curtains and blue wallpaper
that useta be Daddy's bedroom it's a big bedroom „ isn't it with all those white cupboards
you know the one I mean it's got twin beds in it two beds
that's where Daddy useta sleep
well that's the bedroom that Nanna and Granddad have the exercise bicycle in
can't say I've seen it for a while could you
is it not there now
well they've either put it in the attic room or they've put it in the loft
because Nanna and Granddad have a big house „ don't they
they have downstairs then they have the next floor with three bedrooms the bathroom
and then you go up some more steps and the entire top of the house
is what
wool
wool does Nanna keep loads of wool up there
right
they've got another room „ haven't they
which runs the length of the house third story
from that room what can you see when you look out of the window
but what in particular
you see an airport
what color airport
well what's tall
can you not see Blackpool tower
oh Thomas Henry you can
you know I thought that's why every time we go there we take you up there to have a look at the tower
it's in the distance but you can see it quite clearly especially at night when it's all lit up
and we only have a loft as well „ don't we
yes
well the next time you go when it gets dark cause it gets darkish in the evening „ doesn't it when we're still there
let's have a look
mm I'll take you up there
I know well the stairs go round in a spiral big wooden stairs
I wish we had a house with so much room Thomas that would be nice
would you like a windmill
a windmill you'd like to live in a windmill „ would you
I don't think there'd be an awful lot of room in a windmill actually Thomas
please will you eat properly and then you got upset about spilling milk this is why
your Nan and Granddad don't live in a windmill Thomas „ do they
there's a windmill near where they live „ isn't there
have you been to see that
and was it
two windmills right have you been inside one them
oh it's lovely inside
well I can't remember which one I've been in but there's one and when you go in they still grind corn to make flour
and you can go in and see all the men working
and they give you a show round it's lovely actually and that's one where you hafta go round a spiral staircase
it's very nice
no I haven't
but when you're on the motorway I don't know whether it's coming back from Nanna and Granddad's or the whether it's the Lake district you can see it
you can see some houses a group of houses and there's a windmill there
and that is actually a house where somebody lives
that's near the motorway though
do you know what it's like to live in a windmill it's like a
the dam's breaking
are you breaking up your hula hoops
I've always thought that it would be strange to live in a lighthouse as well
to live in a lighthouse must be very strange
well the shape of a I mean to get to the top you'd hafta go
I've been in a lighthouse at Scarborough
and there you hafta go round and round as you're going up the steps
right to the top and it's very tall a lighthouse
mm
I don't think Purdie would like to live in a lighthouse because you know at the moment she just trots to the door „ doesn't she to be let out
well the door of a lighthouse what would be there when you opened the door of a lighthouse
sea
well lighthouses are in the middle of seas „ aren't they
or usually at the edge of piers

no
I don't think Purdie can do cat paddle
I don't know what would happen if she got into water
I don't know whether they can swim or not
they don't like water cats
she doesn't even like getting wet in the rain „ does she Purdie
no
she doesn't
hm mm
I have bathed her occasionally
I think we're doing more eating than talking „ aren't we
we might hafta do a few minutes extra on this tape at the end
to make up for all the time when we've being going chew
I don't mean break it up you see we might hafta do a little bit now at breakfast and we might hafta do some later
well I think sometimes Thomas
we'll try and go have a look a that windmill
we'll ask Daddy because it was with Daddy that I went
and lighthouses I mean at one point you could go and visit lighthouses
when people lived in them but something's happened now and I can't think what it is
I don't know whether people don't live in them any more
you see the lighthouse it would have been very hard work I would imagine
saying that he shined lights to warn ships that they were coming near you know there were rocks and they were coming to the pier
and so I've a feeling now it's all done by computer
I don't think people hafta stay in lighthouses any more
mm
has there not been something on the Teletubbies or the Tweenies about lighthouses
the Tweenies I seem to think I've seen something what's that program all about
and so three ships come sailing in
that one
well I don't think I've seen a lighthouse on that one
I wonder if we've got any books about lighthouses I don't think we have „ have we
there might be something in that nursery rhyme book
I'll have a look later
underneath the ground and what sort of people would live under the ground
worms

but to worms if that's where they live that's their home that's normal to them
why not
are you sure it just wasn't because he saw you hm
mm
you said feefiefoefum and nearly trod on it
mm
yes I think they are Thomas but I'm not sure why
probably
you know I don't know a lot about worms I should do
mm
I should hope so
you only just started school
have you talked about worms at school or at nursery
well you know what we'll hafta do „ don't you
we'll hafta look it up in a book
worms and see what it says
there's a worm at the bottom of the garden
and
and his name is Smuggy hair

she loves it at night does she why
birds eat worms I know that
they make food for plants „ do they
did you
really
well you know more about it than I do Thomas
it's funny I can't say I've really ever thought much about worms or why we've got worms
it is like snails and slugs
I mean all I know it's that they eat my plants
and yet really well I mean slugs I think are horrible things but snails although they eat plants there're quite a few stories and cards about snails „ aren't there
Sammy snail and
people like that
who's Ruby snail
is that the song you heard
did you
is that a little song you've made up or have you heard that somewhere
have you
and that's how you know it's it sounds like food for the plants
mm
right
there's a worm at the bottom of the garden
alright would you like some more hula hoops Thomas
I haven't got hula hoops
what are they called
Honeyloops

would you like some more
would you like them or would you like a piece of toast or would you like a kiwi fruit or an apple

I'll just have a look in the fridge I think we've got a yoghurt but I think it's out of date so I can't give you that
well I'll tell you why it's out of date

and with his whiskers on his face
he headed out to sea
kitty
look at pretty little kitty

and if my Mum would let me I'd eat you till I bust
do you know what that means
I'd eat you till I bust means I'd eat you till I'd burst
oh now that's the one Daddy fell into the pond I'll read this then I'll get some more toast
everyone grumbled the sky was grey
we had nothing to do and nothing to say
we were nearing the end of a dismal day
and there seemed to be nothing beyond
then Daddy fell into the pond
and everyone's face grew merry and bright
and Timothy danced for sheer delight
give me the camera quick oh quick
he's crawling out of the duckweed click
and the gardener suddenly slapped his knee
and doubled up shaking silently
and all the ducks the ducks all quacked as if they were daft
and it sounded as if the old Drake laughed
oh there wasn't a thing that didn't respond when Daddy fell into the pond
Daddy
but we're still no nearer finding anything about a light house
pardon
Jenny that's from the Jenny on the
the wobbling race do you think it might be that one
there is one called tomato ketchup you're right

then the sun came out and melted them and made them both the dribbliest
let's get some juice
well that's not a poem that's just a picture

and this one this is one that Nanna useta say to you when you were a baby
I eat my peas with honey I've done it all my life
they do taste kind of funny
but it keeps them on the knife
it's a good book that „ isn't it
well they're both nice books because
yes
the nursery collection one is really just nursery rhymes and songs like
that's for quite young children but there are some
Thomas sit down please
when the other one the rhyming book there's one in there she bought you for your birthday cause she
she's so about her
Thomas Jeannine will listen to this
she's coming actually on Thursday
you can hear yourself
is it Thursday
I don't know actually I'll hafta look on the calendar
Thomas stop it
oh yes actually I think there's one in there about apples
while you're eating this piece of toast I'll find the one about apples
well you can dedicate it to Jeannine
okay
this is called sugar cake bubble
sugar sugar cake bubbling in a pot
bubble sugar cake bubble thick and hot
sugar sugar cake slice some coconut sweet and sticky brown and gooey
I could eat the lot
right
I'm sure there's one about an apple
if it's not
right
please turn that round you turn your plate
if it's not in this poem but it must be in the other nursery rhyme book
I'm an apple it's called
it is in this book I'm an apple
oh here we are I'm an apple
here we are if Jeannine's listening this is for Jeannine
I'm a red apple eat me
chew me and chomp me sweetly
pick me and peel me but bite me don't steal me
for I'm a red apple eat me
I'm a green apple bake me
into hot pies and sweet puddings make me
cut me and core me but please don't ignore me
for I'm a green apple bake me
I'm a gold apple leave me
don't pluck me and please don't be greedy
you've eaten too much so don't snatch and don't touch
let me stay in sunlight leave me
do you think she would like that one
oops a daisy I very nearly sent the tea flying then
it's cold anyway now
oh look on the back of this book there's all sorts of things including
toast popping out of the toaster
right
we'll just see in the nursery rhyme book if there's anything about apples
there's one there about if all the seas on page seventy one so if we can't find anything about apples
we'll have a look at page seventy one
oh there's one called the apple tree
page one six four
the apple tree
here is the tree with leaves so green
here are the apples that hang between
when the wind blows the apples fall
here is a basket to gather them all
that's an action rhyme look cause it shows you at the bottom how to do a tree with arms
and then your fists are the apples
and the arms and let the wrists fall suddenly that's when the apples fall
then link hands to make a basket
that's good
no
I can't see anything else about apples
let's just have a quick look at page seventy one
it looks like it might have been it's a teddy bear in the bath
oh you'll like this one
baby's shoes Mother's shoes Father's shoes policeman's shoes giant's shoes
oh there's one I saw a ship a sailing
well there's no lifeboats on that one and this one's if all the seas were one sea
not a great sea
if all the seas were one sea what a great sea that would be
and if all the trees were on tree what a great tree that would be
and if all the axes were one axe what a great axe that would be
and all the men were one man what a great man he would be
and the great man took the great axe and cut down the great tree and let it fall into the great sea
what a splishsplash that would be
watch your hands are sticky
don't touch it cause your hands are sticky
I know there should be
right
another piece of toast sweetheart
do you know what we did with that piece of toast
because we were talking and I forgot
put jam on it and what did you ask for
marmalade

Snugs the dirty rascal do you mean I'm the dirty rascal
right
I've just bought your megasketch in here
this is what I think a lighthouse looks like
there
it looks like a trumpet upside down „ doesn't it
you can
oh
yes
you show me what you think a lighthouse is like
while I think about it rack my brains and think where have we got a picture of a lighthouse
we've definitely got one somewhere
we must have
right
I'll just pop this in for another second because it doesn't seem very brown in there a few moments
have you any idea where a lighthouse is not where a lighthouse is I mean is a picture of a lighthouse
and what's that Thomas
a lighthouse
you are clever
that's the right shape
and I was thinking you can actually see they're always white „ aren't they
always painted brightly so that ships can see them and then you have slats for windows on the way up
it's such a long time since I've been in one I can't remember but I remember being very excited when we went in it
yes
some big waves and there'll probably seagulls around
and what about big rocks
what would you like jam or marmalade on this one Thomas
are you

Thomas you are a rowdy boy
alright that'll do
are you
you know when you pot up marmalade
oh it smells nice toast
there we are
toast and marmalade for my favorite boy
oh that's good
you've got the shape right Thomas you're very good now at drawing
I think you
oh yes
well a rocket or a lighthouse it's all the same
what a shame
that's it don't let your toast go cold „ will you
it looks like a cone shape actually it looks
that's what it looks like that cone
doesn't it
when you think about it
here you are I've found you a picture of a lighthouse it's only a sketchy one
but look this boochy
boochy at Bendinct's point
and there's
a lighthouse look there's a door windows and can you see the light beaming round the top
isn't that funny
somebody's stuck the book together and they've stuck the picture upside down
there we are another lighthouse
suddenly we've got lotsof pictures of lighthouses
oh
and another
that's right in the middle of the sea „ isn't it
yes this is a nice book
well I'm ever so pleased that we finally have found a picture of a lighthouse
although I don't think it features in the story „ does it
because there's a picture of the seaside look at all the cliffs and the rocks
oh
yes
oh now you see that's right that lighthouse looks like it's got a little cottage or something attached to it
oh
the lighthouse is at Bendincts point because I just read a little bit of the story
it says as usual the captain Frubisher was waiting for budgie when he arrived at the lighthouse at Bendinct's point
so the lighthouse does feature in the story „ doesn't it
well we'll read it in a little moment
sounds like Daddy's up now so we might very well hafta
oh look and there's a fire engine in the story
well I think it looks as if possibly the helicopter must be about to crash or I think that is
and there's the lighthouse again and this time it's night and there's a storm but can you see the light coming off the lighthouse
it says here the gale was getting worse and circled high above the storm to keep radio contact with the lighthouse
so that must mean that the people in the lighthouse can talk through a radio to people in the air „ mustn't it
ohgosh this is incredible because I was actually
do you know why I opened the drawer
because I thought that there might be a holiday brochure in there
and if there was I thought we might find a picture of a lighthouse in the and found this
yes
lighthouse again
well this is quite clever
listen to it
Daddy we've got two questions for you
no
one is do you know what worms are useful for
Daddy's reading the gas bill and isn't listening
do you know what worms are useful for Daddy
no
we don't know what the purpose of worms are
no
I don't Thomas said it's to make food for the plants
and the other
we were going to ask where there was a picture of a lighthouse but we've actually found one now „ haven't we
do people still live in lighthouses Daddy
it's computerized now
have you been in a lighthouse
there's three questions now can Thomas go to the windmill near your Mum and Dad's
you know the one we went to where they make flowers still
and we've just found this budgie book because we've found a picture of the lighthouse
and in it a fire engine into the sea as well
Daddy's just woken up „ haven't you Daddy
oh yes
well it says Lionel made an emergency landing
his rotors were completely bent and fire engines quickly approached
so it sounds as if something's happened
oh
yes
I don't know what's happened but look at his blades
they're not good „ are they something's happened to them
you have fire engines at ordinary airports though „ don't you
in case something happens to the planes when they come down
but I think this picture of a cone is pretty good lighthouse
if we were drawing a picture of a lighthouse and the base of the cone here could be the rocks and that could be the lighthouse
we could use that to trace round „ couldn't we
right
are your hands sticky
give them a quick rinse in the bowl please
roll your sleeves up and give them a quick rinse in the bowl there's a good boy
