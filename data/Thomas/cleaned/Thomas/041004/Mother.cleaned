right
now if we're going to do the sweet shop
we need
we're not going to go to the sweet shop
but you know the sweet shop in Didsbury
where sweet shop was
did you notice something different about her shop
when we went in on the shelves
were lots and lotsof glass jars
and in the glass jars were sweeties
because most places you go to buy sweets
they're in either packets
or
or those plastic you know
yeah jars
but you know those plastic containers
such as Spar shop
the one near the railway station
that's right
that's right
that's right
right
you're calling the grabbers the tongs
that's right
tongs
no
not tongs

tongs these are tongs
grabbers as you call them yeah
that's right
you lift the plastic lid „ don't you
and you pick out what you want
you can have that
and then you can have
you put them in little bags
now look
down here we've got lots and lots and lotsof jars
now you must be careful because
I'll need these jars later on
because you know Mummy makes jam
and marmalade and things like that
and they're made of glass
and what happens with glass
yeah so we've got to be very careful
but what I though we'd do
yeah
that's right
you'd end up cut „ wouldn't you
pardon
a bone might break hm
pardon
you saw a skull
where have you seen a skull
oh dear
a proper one
don't bend those please
well goodness me yes
that's right
that's what we're
oh well that's what we look like inside „ isn't it
we take our clothes off and we've got skin
but if all our skin fell off
and all our blood ran out
that's what we would look like

what
don't run about
right
oh no
before we do that before any customers can come
we've got to stock the shop up
yes
it's no good customers coming in if there's no sweets
so let's get a few of these things
now these are wooden
what are these
letters of the alphabet
so they're quite big
so let's find a big jar Tom
well these jars have been washed
it isn't
it hasn't got a lid „ has it
this one's got a lid
you've not broke your skull

right
do you wanna
I will
I will
it says Nescafe Goldblend
but we'll pretend it says sweeties
right
so we won't
that's it
can put those in the jar
quietly
now when a customer comes and says
have you got any sweets that look like
letters of the alphabet
we can say ah yes
and talking about skeletons Thomas
does it remind you of the book we read at night
Funny Bones
that's right
are you not going to put all of those in there
no
right
well let's just get some other things
in other jars
I don't think we should open yet
right
let's get a smaller jar now
choose a different jar
we can have a smaller one for these beads
right
now do you wanna put all the beads in one jar
or do you want another jar
two jars
okay
oh
it's got Sellotape on it
so I can't open it
perhaps use that for something else
is it too big
never mind
that's right
anything we do
well listen we must remember
Tom these are beads
beads and
they're not proper sweets
and they're small
and they look very bright
and they look like some sweets „ don't they
but don't put those in your mouth
please whatever you do
now to get those into the jar
how about we pop them into that funnel
shall we tip these into there like that
ooh that made a nice clatter
and now we can just tip
tip it like that
look
how's that
is there
oh you want some in that jar as well
okay
in they go
hm okay
we'll hafta make up names for these sweets as well
before we sell them
letter sweets
right
q sweets
why are they called q sweets
oh cube
cube
I thought you said q
cube sweets very good
smashing
no
yeah
don't put them on very tightly
just put them ever so loosely Tom
ever so loosely otherwise we won't be able to open them
we've got more letters there „ haven't we
oh these make good sweets
do you know what these are
well they
ha yes
but actually
no
it's an empty box
but all the lids from tubes of smarties
now those would make nice sweets
and these have got letters on them
look
at the lids on smarties
do you know what Mummy useta do when she was a little girl
I think I told you this before

what
what did I useta do
now I'll tell you again then
on my bicycle
shall I show you on your bicycle what we useta do
we useta stick
smartie lids on the spokes like that
all the way round
so that when you were cycling along
you had this whiz of color
and you hadta
you know people with the
most colored different colored smartie lids
had the best bikes
so we'll use those as other sweets
now what can we call those
what did you call them
lie sweets
light
right
so we've got letter sweets
we've got cube sweets
and we've got light sweets
why are they called light sweets

oh they are light
oh aren't you clever
light
and I was thinking about light as in not dark
but you're meaning light because
when you've got a handful of smartie lids they're quite
light to weigh „ aren't they
oh Thomas you're ahead of me
not too tight
that's enough
now we could have
these are actually fridge magnets Thomas
but these are also letters of the alphabet
I don't think we can use those magnets
we'll just put those straight on the fridge actually
you can do a pattern with those later
but these
I'd forgotten we had these
in fact we won't put these away when we've finished
playing with them
we'll just leave them on the fridge
no what would you like to call this
oh another one
what would you like to call those sweets
they're colored letters of the alphabet
they're plastic and they've got magnets on the back
pasts
I can't say that
pasts p a s t s
pasts
and why are they called pasts Thomas
hm
they're pasty
they're pasty
hm
we've actually got a couple of jars here that are plastic
they'd be good ones „ wouldn't they
no that
oh no
that's glass
yes it's only two that I've got that are plastic
pass sweets
it is nearly full „ isn't it
do you know what useta be in that jar
peanut butter
what do you mean urgh yuck
it's nice
ha you're yucky
now
oh dear
would you like to pop those on the fridge
those fridge magnets
wanna tell me what they are
while you're doing it
ooh no
we've some more things yet
right
now do you remember these little things
this is your
do you wanna put them into jars or leave them in the box
you remember doing it
I remember you doing that
it's a wooden box
with little wooden shapes „ isn't it
we've got
what shapes have we got
look
we can look at the tablet on top
gingerbread man
yes
very good
and the colored wooden blocks
and the shape sorters
must have put them
through the slots
and into the box
I remember one summer
must have been your
well you were born in April
so it can't have been the first summer
must have been the second summer
we went out one afternoon
into the garden and I spread out a big rug
and we sat there in the sun
you had your little sun hat on
with that shape sorter box
and you were so proud of yourself
when you managed to get one through
I bet you could do it now
very easily „ couldn't you

what's that one
Christmas tree
and you see when you useta do it
you would never have
I don't think you were talking at the time
but when you did talk
you just useta say treeq
and houseq
and manq
whereas now you're saying Christmas tree
and gingerbread man
because it is that's the shape of a gingerbread man
and funnily enough
look
what I've got
a cutter

I've got it there to wash up
don't usually have it out on the side
right
do you wanna leave the others in the box
want another jar
has it
ooh
gently
it's making a lot of noise
I'm more worried about the jar smashing
the lid
I don't think there was a lid for that one love „ was there
do you not remember
oh here we are
look
there is a lid it's there
have you noticed all the different shapes
what shape are most of the jars
well they're round „ aren't they
but this one isn't
the coffee jars are
that shape
what's that shape
well it's a hexagon lid „ isn't it
we're nearly ready Tom
you want the till ready
you can but actually we've got another till
lotsof little weighing machines „ haven't we
right

Thomas

now did you sell sweets in your shop
right
there's some lolly pops
look
it's only a picture of some on
but that will do

this is a shopping game actually
which we haven't played yet

are they
would you believe this Thomas
it looks absolutely brand new
and I bought this
at a fair somewhere
and it belonged to somebody else

some more sweeties there
on that picture
and it looks as if nobody's ever played with it
well we'll play with that another time
keep it in the shop
now would you like this shop
as well
you don't want that one as well
no
we've got a purse there
look
that we bought in Spain
we'll use that for my money
oh look
this little box
oh it's got stamps in
but that's had peppermints in the past „ hasn't it
more sweeties
is it
well
now that could be a machine
where when I put a penny in the slot
the bubblegum
I mean actually it's your
but we could pretend it was bubblegum or olu
all the way down into the bag
are you not impressed with that
no
does it
right
so we're not playing with that one
I'll just tidy
I'm sure we've got a proper
okay
there's a bell on this shop „ isn't there
oh I know but I can ring it
I can walk there and ring it
oh no
no
because the scales you mustn't bash them
because they're not toys
no
we'll use
well I'll just go ping pong

yeah
I don't think we've stocked up properly yet
yeah
alright
well I think shall we put some of these in here
and pretend they're chocolates
they're actually little bits of
nuts and bolts and things from your
tool set „ aren't they
we won't take too many
yes those would fit in
I don't think anything else would fit in jars „ would it
right
now
because it's a sweetie shop
we've got these
some raisins
four
what are they
four magic gems

no
you've got to buy
ah
no
no
you can't help yourself
and a packet of
chocolate buttons
now

you're just having one raisin to check
before you sell them „ are you
right
I see
right
shall I put those fridge magnets
in a jar or what
just wondering if I've got something other than a jar
what can I stand them in Thomas
there you are
they could be jelly shapes „ couldn't they
now
I think
shall we put these
well you do you see
you need a lot of things
how about we stack
all the sweeties nicely
so that the customer can see
no
and then you could have your weighing scales
next to them and then your till
you don't hafta sit down
well I just thought if I could see
what we've got on offer
well not just me
any customer
we'll put it that way
then you do it so they're laying on the coffee jar
don't they look nice
it could yes
is there
just a minute then
hm
Thomas
right
well take your sock off
pardon
just take your sock off
I don't think it is
do you know what I think it is
you know when I was arranging those flowers
just still take your sock off
if your foot's wet
you can
put the toys down
I think it's just water from the flowers love
right
do you want me to wash your feet a little bit
yes
right
well take your other sock off
and we'll get a completely new pair of socks
I think it's just flower water actually sweetheart
let me get a little bucket of water
because I don't want you causing a mess

you're not sposta walk in it
dabble your feet in it
we'll put some of this nice orange soap in
satsuma soap

and I'll just put some newspaper on the water
to soak it up
I think it's while I was doing those flowers earlier on love
because I did spill some water
and it's flower water
just dabble a foot in at a time
flower
oops

that's it

oh actually it's not very warm that water „ is it
is it alright for you
well water on the carpet again

on the towel
that's right
just a minute
this will be nice water
because this has got orange soap in it
just a minute
that's it
okay
oh your whole foot fits in there
now when flowers have been standing
don't splash it on purpose
when flowers have been standing in water the leaves
you're sposta take the leaves off the stems
before you put them in water
because if the leaves get wet
then poo the water smells horrible
it all goes funny
and those flowers have been in that water for quite a long time
okay sweetheart

don't tread on it again
I'll put some newspaper down
just to soak up the water

I'll just put this newspaper down
and we'll just avoid

pioes

get off
oh you mustn't tread on there Thomas

very nice
mm
oh this one tastes good
does it
what color's that
a black one
mm
mm yummy „ aren't they
throw the bag on the floor
that's not very nice „ is it
but what if a customer comes in
before you've had chance to clean it up
and she slips on the bag
it would be shut
do you not think it would be better just to pick the bag up
no
do you think it would be better to leave the
bag on the floor for somebody to slip on

do you
is that what you do with all your customers
sometimes
and have you had many customers that have
come in and slipped on bags
and broken their legs
no
oh have you
how many
six
and what happened to them
did it
the ambulance came out
and what happened then
and what did the police say
you blamed somebody else for leaving the bag on the floor

and what did the policeman say
and did they find a robber
I know you did
the tongs
don't break them
right
well I seem to remember that you were weighing me out
some sweets that we couldn't think of the name for
what are those sweets called
alright well could I have
the anything sweets in a bag then please
I'll have this ThomasTheTankEngine bag please
for the anything sweets
I will
I think this is why the shop's free
because people come in and slip
and they end up getting their own bags and things „ don't they
right
now I'd like some more sweets now
oh very good
you've picked it up
I think you realized „ didn't you
that people might slip
now
I'd like some more of
those cone sweets
but this time I'd like them from a different jar
and can we put them in
can I
no
don't wash those please
oh alright
well I'll do this
and I'm going to do something magic with these
I'm going to weigh them in that machine
weigh
do I
your hands smell a bit funny „ don't they
well no
I think it was that when you took your sock off
about that flower water

shall we just give your hands a rinse
it's alright
you can come back to that in a minute
shop's going to close at seven o'clock
is it
well there don't seem to be many customers

in the sweet shop

is it not very comfortable
is it
well do you have a pillow and some blankets
well that's alright then
what
is it
oh but I haven't finished getting my sweeties yet
yeah
yeah

I think it's only the small ones
that'll go down darling
that's why I was going to weigh
these into the bag
like that
look
into this funnel
which is an empty inside of a kitchen roll holder
more and more
they're nearly all in „ aren't they
magic
yes

I think there's a new till here
do you know when I was tidying out upstairs
I came across this
would you like a look at this one

a tree
