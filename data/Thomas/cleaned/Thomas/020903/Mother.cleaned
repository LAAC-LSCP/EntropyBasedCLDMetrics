I didn't say the highchair was dirty
this is why you're better at the table
because you've got spaces to put things „ haven't you
we keep the highchair here because when Abigail comes she needs to sit in it „ doesn't she
but you seem to have enjoyed sitting in it
we had you in it on Christmas day „ didn't we
because there were a lot of us around the table

I think it would be the fireman having the drink
not the fire engine „ don't you
I'm peeling an apple Thomas
if you don't want RiceKrispies you might eat some fruit
would you like some fruit
be careful Thomas
because there's milk on it
they taste nice
the fireman as just told me if they were his he'd eat the whole bowl
the fireman thinks you're really lucky to have a nice bowl of RiceKrispies
will they not fit in his mouth
no
that's why he wants you to eat them
he's full
he as had quite enough now
the fireman as said he really likes RiceKrispies
but he as just finished his
and he hopes that you'll eat the rest
and then you'll grow up to be big and strong like the fireman „ won't you
because if you've got to do busy jobs today Thomas
you're going to need some food inside that tummy „ aren't you
right
shall I put the fireman over here
there you are

you might hafta rescue a pussy cat from a tree
or you might hafta lift something very heavy
