because he hadta stop at that stop anyway
when we got on Mummy said thank you for waiting „ didn't she

pink flavored
that's usually prawn cocktail or smoky bacon „ isn't it
or when they red
salt and vinegar

oh well it must
I think it was smoky bacon
he didn't look like a prawn cocktail sort of bus driver „ did he
no
whatever prawn cocktail bus driver looks like
he didn't really look like a smoky bacon bus driver „ did he
I think he was more a cheese and onion sort of bus driver
haha
what are your favorite crisps
nothing
oh I'll remember that
the next time you want some crisps I'll say oh you don't like crisps
Tom
get that sausage out
no
never put sausage up your nose
never put anything up your nose
no
it's not funny
it's dangerous
if you put that up your nose you won't be able to breathe
you know when you've got a cold and you're all stuffed up like that
it's not nice „ is it
it isn't
now will you stop messing with that food please
I'm going to get very cross
why do you mess with your food
if you don't want it put it to one side
but I warn you now there are no sweets
so if you're hungry eat your meal because there's nothing else
you got hiccups now
what's the matter
go away
why
because I'm going to hiccup you
no Thomas
don't
you've got a sausage up your nose and you've just been a spoon in your eye
what on earth's the matter with you
you've got some hiccups
oh dear
hiccups isn't nice „ is it
you didn't put any more of that sausage up your nose „ did you
that's alright then
eat that bit of sausage because sometimes if you swallow something
have a sip of Mummy's water
there you are
that's good for water

that's what you have when have hiccups
have a little drink
oh

go on
eat that up
you want the hiccups to shoo away
oh bless you
sometimes a shock works with hiccups
when Mummy has hiccups I take a teaspoonful of vinegar
and it works every time
but I think it's a bit too strong for you
no
because it's too strong for you
it might make your tummy a bit sore
Mummy's a lot bigger than you
there's a blackbird „ is there
