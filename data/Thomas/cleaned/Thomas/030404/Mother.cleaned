what about the recycling bin for the garden rubbish

oh
so you've told Jeannine
these are our bin bags
it is Monday today
the bin men are coming actually „ aren't they
right
I've got some garden rubbish
garden rubbish is always in green bags
and that's for the recycling bin
so I'll leave that there
that goes in a special bin „ doesn't it
there's my garden rubbish dustbin man
yeah
in the recycling part „ doesn't it
you do really „ don't you
bottles
cans
and it's all useta make new things „ isn't it
you do know really but perhaps you don't know how to explain it
who did we see doing some recycling
AuntieMay and Pippa did some recycling „ didn't they
show Jeannine what happens on the bus
when the bins are full
show her how you empty them into the back
this is what happens in Didsbury on a Friday morning cause we see them
we've still got dustbin bags here „ haven't we
but in Didsbury they have wheelie bins
right
now
shall we put some in the other bin poppet
no
Grandma and Grandad do „ don't they
people in Manchester do but we're in Stockport and we've got bags
but we see this in Didsbury every week „ don't we
it needs to go the other way Darling
no
the handle's on the outside so the men can just
that's it
so the men can wheel it straight in
that's right
and then what happens when they get to the tip
show Jeannine
I know but she maybe didn't see
she didn't see over there
alright

Purdie's rug's usually the tip
it goes the other way love
so the handle's on the outside

can you hear that noise outside

separate from wheelie bins
it's from ToysR Us and Mummy hadta haggle with them because when we got it it's actually cracked here

and we hadta point that out to them „ didn't she
because it was brand new in a box but it still was damaged
and it was the only dustbin lorry so we hadta have it
we actually went to buy a garage „ didn't we
we went to buy a garage but they were only very small ones and we wanted a large garage
and they didn't have the right one so we looked for something else and we came across this
what did Nana and Grandad say when they saw it

actually
ah
