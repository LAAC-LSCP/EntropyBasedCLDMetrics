I'm AuntyMabel
I'm sitting in my chair
I wonder what sort of day I'll have today
I wonder if PostmanPat will come soon
he might have something for me
he usually comes at this sort of time
oh that's a little noise
it sounds like somebody might be taping on the door
hello
who's there
hello
is there anybody there
hello

who's saying no
I thought there was somebody there
PostmanPat
PostmanPat are you coming to see me today
PostmanPat
is PostmanPat not coming
oh dear
oh and I was so looking forward to getting a letter
never mind
well if PostmanPat is going to talk to me I think I might go into the kitchen and do some washing up
I can still hear a funny noise
are you sure PostmanPat hasn't called

PostmanPat
PostmanPat
I can hear a clock ticking
where's PostmanPat
there he is
PostmanPat good morning
how are you
you're ThomasHenry Lastname

PostmanPatHenry Lastname
I see
I think I should pick PostmanPat up and give him a cuddle
ah do you wanna sit on my knee a minute and talk to me
what would you like to tell me
what would you like to tell me

what have you been doing today
you don't know
you're sitting in your van talking to me „ are you
what have you got to say to me
you haven't got any letters for posting
you've delivered them all

oh excuse me
PostmanPat if you're going to the shop I think I'd quite like a Lemsip and some tissues
I've got a cold
AuntyMabel's not very well
what are you doing with your sleeve PostmanPat

are you rolling your sleeve up and down
is he
oh bye bye PostmanPat
I'll see you again
what day will I see you
you've just found a whistle from Christmas on the road
it's one of those blowy things we got for Christmas „ isn't it
I'm not sure
maybe it as just fallen out of the toy box but you found it on the road „ did you PostmanPat
well do you think it might belong to one of the Pottage twins Tom or Katy
why don't you drive to MissusPottage's house because you're bound to have a letter for her
and you knock on the door ask MissusPottage if Tom or Katy have dropped a whistle
because if they have and they've lost it they'd be very sad „ wouldn't they
oh do you know Tom and Katy dropped that
they were playing with it PostmanPat
and they dropped it
and they've been so upset wondering where it had gone
thank you so much for picking it up and bringing it to us
that's lovely PostmanPat
thank you very much
I shall tell Tom and Katy that you found the whistle and brought it back
and they'll be so pleased they'll probably come and say thank you themselves
you're going now
where are you going
AuntyMabel's house
have you anything for AuntyMabel today
you haven't got any letters or parcels
you've just got Jess
I bet when you get to AuntyMabel's house it's lunchtime
oh look
Natalie's walking past and she's got Bethan and Connor with her
look
look at that
what as Bethan pushing
it looks like she's pushing a little horse
ohgosh it isn't a horse
it's
I see what it is
Bethan as got a dolls pram and Connor is riding on a little horse „ isn't he
look
and Sue's at home
it looks like Sue as just arrive at home
can you see her
alright
right
did you wanna go and wave to Sue
no
go to the window and see if she's looking for you
she usually looks to see if we're here „ doesn't she
it's lunchtime if Sue's home
I bet that's why you've come to see AuntyMabel
you've come to see if she as got any sausage rolls for lunch „ haven't you
yes
would you like a sausage roll PostmanPat
you'll just have some lemonade or you've just had some lemonade
have you
oh you have „ have you

are you yawning
are you not very well
you're very quiet
let's go and have some lunch
are you
well you drive towards the table
and I think we'll get some lunch because it's quite a „ isn't it
are you
okay
well AuntyMabel's going to get some lunch ready because you're very quiet
perhaps you'll perk up after you've had something to eat
this is a very snacky lunch today „ isn't it
what's on fire
oh no
you're a fireman „ are you
well apparently my chips are on fire
I didn't realize
here you are
can you reach
okay
there you are
I'll have one of those as well
they're nice and crunchy Thomas
you're a crocodile
oh you're eating prawn crackers „ aren't you
that's why you're sounding so crispy
you're crunching
we always know it's Tuesday because it's sausage roll day
if I cut one of these up you can eat that „ can't you

Daddy bought them in the sausage roll shop „ did he

would you like some cheese as well
no thank you
you would like some
yes
right
well we'll have some cheese as well
I've got a very big knife here for cutting the cheese
I'll slice some
ooh that's a big knife „ isn't it
you're going to help me
yes
I think I could do with some help
it's not easy cutting a big piece of cheese like that „ is it
right
and again
no
press down
press down Mummy's sharp knife
ohgosh that's hard
it's hard work „ isn't it
there's your cheese
now if
it's more like a bit of what
it looks more like a gate
oh well
ah I looked at it and I didn't think it looked like a bit of gate
does it taste nice
you've got some fluff in your hair off your jumper
a little piece of blue fluff
your jumper

I know it's on your head but it as come from your jumper because you're jumper's quite fluffy
and little pieces of fluff keep coming off your jumper
and somehow a piece has got stuck in your hair
please don't kick the table Thomas
no
it's not anybody knocking
it's you kicking the table
that was a funny noise
did you hear it
I don't know
it was a little squeak „ wasn't it
I know what the banging noise is
that's you
you're making the banging noise
I thought we were sharing these
it's alright to share „ isn't it
oh thank you so much
that's very kind
what are you looking at outside
pardon
dirty beer over there
where
near your side
I can't see anything that looks like CocaCola near your side
you like those „ don't you
prawn crackers
it is
yes
it's sunny again
what would you like to sing
bring me sunshine
that one
I don't know anymore
I don't know anymore
would you like some more cheese
you would like some more cheese
would you like me to cut you another piece of cheese
it's all yours
are you saying no thank you or yes thank you
no thank you
it's yes please
it's yes please and no thank you
I couldn't tell what you were saying because you had your mouth full
did you eat all the chocolate mousse that was in the fridge
I can't see any now
there you are
another nice piece of cheese
pardon
it's more like a what
it's more like CocaCola on a bridge
what an earth does a piece of cheese looking like CocaCola on a bridge mean
I don't know what you mean Thomas
what do you mean
do you not know
don't put them on your head
no
that bowl's dirty now
it as had prawn crackers in it „ hasn't it
where do we buy prawn crackers from
from Tesco
well we might do
but these were bought from the chip shop for a change
the Chinese chip shop
the Chinese take away
well Mummy put them in a container when we got them home
we don't keep them in the fridge
when we bought them they were hot „ weren't they
we bought them from the shop where we occasionally buy chips
and it's opposite the butcher's
it probably is
yes
oh I don't know
they're going to be open now because it's lunchtime
they open at lunchtime and then they close again in the afternoon
and then they open up about five o'clock ready for tea
and then I think they stay open all evening till very late at night
and then they close

are you covering my legs up with my skirt
I'm AuntyMabel again „ am I
I must admit my legs are a little bit cold today
if I cut an apple up will you eat an apple
I bet you do of I cut it up
shall I do one
I'm going to have some apple
we could share „ couldn't we
yes
share an apple
you don't like that at all
it's not too unusual that we're going to share an apple „ is it
we've shared many things before Thomas
oh yes
quack quack
you're pretending to be a duck now „ are you
it is a nice apple „ isn't it
it's not
I've just washed it
I've taken the pips out to save you doing it
there you are
perfect
in fact I might cut up two apples and then we can each have one
because you're eating that now „ aren't you
I don't know whether it's just because I'm using this big knife but it cuts very easily
it's really too large this knife „ isn't it
and after we've had our lunch we should go for a walk
we needta go to the shop to buy some more milk
and we've got some letters to put in the post
you like posting letters „ don't you
are you not talking to me
why not
you've been told it's rude to talk with your mouthful „ haven't you
the concentration of eating an apple
oh I think you can
we could go in the pushchair but it's better really if you walk
it's an exercise
exercise those little legs
get some fresh air because it might rain you never know
if it rains this afternoon which it looks like it might then we'll be sorry we didn't go out when the sun was still shining
I can see it's a good job Mummy cut an apple up for herself „ isn't it
because you look as if you've nearly eaten the other one
you're a hungry blackbird
are you

a hungry blackbird
that's a new one
well perhaps it isn't new
you've said it before and I didn't know what you were talking about
but that was very clear „ wasn't it
a hungry blackbird
how many blackbirds were in the pie Thomas
yes
blackbirds do apples „ don't they
apples and bread and worms and red berries of the tree
and what do blackbirds say
they say
actually blackbirds have a beautiful voice
they sing
and we know a song about a blackbird „ don't we
I can't think how it goes now but it's about four and twenty blackbirds
you don't want me to sing it
oh but we've got to get to the next bit
wait and see your apple
what are you talking about
wait and see
wait and see
who says wait and see
the big blackbird
oh well all I was going to sing next was
along came the blackbird and pecked off his nose
or pecked off her nose
I think it was a lady in the garden hanging out the clothes
along came the blackbird and pecked off her nose
shall we put it back on
there we are
it's back on again

are you going to eat this sweetheart
no thank you
are you sure you're going to have had enough if you don't eat it
you're quite happy with apple and cheese
would you like some ordinary bread
would you like some bread
no
you're pulling me

would you like another drink Tom
would you like another drink
you're no
when you were holding your beaker like that I was just reading what it said on the bottom
it says anyway up cup
anyway up
it means you can hold it anyway up and it doesn't spill

boat a ship
it's a ship
and look
there's the ship's anchor
when the ship comes into dock they throw the anchor down
three little fish
did I say duck or fish
I'm getting confused
the song duck which is why Mummy says quack quack quack but it's actually a fish on your jumper „ isn't it
three little fish
I suddenly realized half way through the song I changed from fish to ducks
Mummy's getting confused
well „ don't they
I'm a fireman „ am I
what have I got to tell Pippin
what's wrong
oh this must be episode were AuntyMabel gets locked in the cupboard and the chip pan's on fire
and Pippin goes running to the fire station going woof woof woof woof
barking „ didn't he
and the fireman said oh Pippin whatever is the matter
and they follow him back to the house just in time because AuntyMabel's in the cupboard
there's a chip pan fire

have you had enough to eat darling
Pippin's trying to get down
well would Pippin like his face and his paws washing
would you like to play with the trains
what's
well if you

you thought it was a helicopter

excuse me
more like a helicopter burbur
what's a helicopter burbur
oh Mummy's just going to finish her lunch and then we'll get you washed
and you can have a play with your trains
no
a pussycat has paws but so does a dog
pussycats' and dogs' feet are called paws
you've seen the little leather pads „ haven't you
on the bottom of her feet
oh not your feet
you've got little leather shoes on the bottom of your feet
Purdie as got little leather pads
are you looking at my legs
what can you see
some bit of red

I can't see any red Thomas
oh do you know what it is
you're sitting on your little seat „ aren't you
what color's your seat
red and green
well it's the reflection from the
red green and blue
it's the reflection from the red part of your chair
look
if I move my leg there my leg's not red anymore „ is it
put it there it's red
put it there it's blue
it's a reflection
in fact if you put your hand down there your hand becomes red
take it away it's normal
put it there it's red
am I asking Pippin what's wrong
oh Pippin whatever's the matter
you're just sticking your tongue in and out
you're a beautiful boy
you're a beautiful dog „ are you
you're so many things in a day Thomas
I get terribly confused
I bet you do
yes
no
I think you do sweetheart
because your fingers will be sticky
you've just eaten lunch
have you finished that piece of cheese
would you like to put that piece of cheese on a plate please
that's right
Mummy can clear the table
and then we'll wipe the crumbs
we'll wipe your crumbs
oops steady
that's full of coffee
it's very hot
Tom it's hot
it isn't
it's hot
that's hot „ isn't it
it won't burn because it isn't that hot
but it's a bit too hot for you to drink Thomas
woof woof
oh you're a nice dog „ aren't you
doggy as not got ears and nose
he has
yes
pussycats dogs rabbits horses they all have mouths ears and noses
yes
they don't have noses that stick out quite like ours
Purdie as got a cute little nose „ hasn't she
with a little bit of pink on the end
but yes
they have noses because they need mouths and noses to eat and
and
elephants have trunks
they have very big noses
I don't think elephants have whiskers
they have tusks
you know those sharp horny bits
they're called tusks
elephant tusks
Purdie has whiskers
you've seen a big elephant on the Tweenies with tusks „ have you
and big giraffes
yes
giraffes have sort of horns „ don't they
that's another thing
and deer
do you remember deer like reindeer
FatherChristmas and Rudolph
they have antlers
they're sort of horny growths on top of their head „ aren't they
they protect them
yes
that's right
they're little hats „ aren't they
they wear
you wanna wear your little hat
your Christmas hat
sorry
it's in the loft darling
that's where everything went after Christmas
it's in the loft
yes
oh no
we can't go into the loft
it's all locked up
yes
but we can't get to the ladder as well
we're not going into the loft now
I'm sure we can manage without a Christmas hat „ don't you
would you like to wear a different sort of hat
I've got plenty of hats on the coat stand
alright
well how about your brown one
the big blue one
the one that you were wearing when you were pretending to be PostmanPat
right
well I'll find that for you
I'm not quite sure
it'll be on the floor
oh here we are
look
it's on the chair
here you are
and then what would you like now
your fire engine
do you want the fire engine
oh you're always doing silly dances „ aren't you
what would
what would you like
the fire engine or your train
alright
shh
calm down
just calm down Thomas
you're a very noisy boy „ aren't you
it looks like you might have got the fire engine wrecked sweetheart
because it looks like there's a water mark on it
it's either red paint or
here's the fireman
oh can the fireman sit over there
but you do really need firemen
the fire engine's watching FiremanSam
having a rest
oh yes
perhaps it's FiremanSam's lunchtime
we've just had our lunch
perhaps it's time for the fireman to have a sandwich
well the fire engine might like to have a nice wash
it might like refueling
it might need filling up with fuel
that would be a good rest „ wouldn't it
that fire engine useta have a squeak
it useta have a squeaky wheel
it does
oh I see

I was just about to say it doesn't squeak any more
perhaps it just squeaks when it's going one way
you're putting your finger on your toes
does it
dingalingaling
dingalingaling
ohgosh
I don't think I should cook chips Thomas
because we're always having fires „ aren't we
ohgosh
fire engine coming
I good job I've got such a good local fireman „ isn't it
that doesn't mind coming put every five minutes when my chip pan's on fire
oh fireman am I glad to see you
I had a terrible accident
the chip pan's on fire
what do we do with a chip pan fire Thomas
we don't put water on it „ do we
no
what did you see the fireman doing when AuntyMabel's chip pan caught fire
pardon
no water
now what did you say before that
what a big
a big cloth
that's right
yes
you saw the fireman
he rushed in and he grabbed the big cloth
I would imagine it's a fire blanket
but if you haven't got a fire blanket you can use something like an ordinary towel or a tea towel
and he threw it on top of the fire the flames „ didn't he
on the pan
you never pour water onto the chip pan because when the water hits the fat it would go whoosh and splash everyone
and really badly burn them
you either put a fire blanket on like the firemen do or you know Mummy's baking trays
like the big trays she bakes the biscuits on
something like that to put on top
or else you get something like a towel or a tea towel
and ring it out
you can put water on the tea towel
ring it out
and put it on to smother the flames
but you remember that „ don't you
that the fireman said no water
my bag's on fire
oh my bag's stuck up a tree „ is it

yes
when we're walking to the Spar shop we've seen this for quite a long time
it must have been around Christmas
there's a plastic bag „ isn't there
high up in the tree blowing in the wind
do you remember
well I would imagine either
well somebody as been a bit careless with it „ haven't they
they haven't got rid of it properly
it must have been blowing along the streets and then a big gust of wind has taken it whoosh up in the air
and it as got stuck right on top of the tree
well just has darling
that's what happens when things blow up
if it hadn't met the tree it might have just floated up and up and up into the sky
but because there's a big tree in the way one of the branches caught the bag
and the bag's
it's a white plastic bag „ isn't it
it flaps in the air
it makes a lot of noise „ doesn't it
flap
I think the bag's empty
it's just it makes an awful noise
oh dear
were there some chips in that bag
oh dear
so the bag that's stuck on the tree in the sky that's on fire „ is it
no
the chips
I don't think we'll ever have a chip pan fire at home Thomas
because we don't have chips do we
if we have chips we have oven chips
chips that you just spread on a baking sheet and bake in the oven
or we go round to the chip shop
oops a daisy

I saw that
the FiremanSam bumped your head „ didn't it
I know it did
you looked very surprised because you didn't know what it was „ did you

I could see it was falling towards your head
but it was going so gently that I knew it wouldn't hurt you
I thought you could see it but you couldn't
because you looked very surprised when it touched you
did you think it was a little man touching you
did you
no
it was just a on the fire engine
no
there isn't
I don't think he did Thomas
the fireman's up in the sky „ is he
has he climbed to the top of the ladder
look
this fireman
have you seen him cling onto the ladders
shall we put up the ladders
ah have you fallen out with the fireman
oh he's a lovely little fireman
he's not a dirty fireman
if he as got a dirty face it's probably because he as been fighting fires
and it's covered in smoke
and when you get covered in smoke then your face goes black
all grey and sooty
that's his oxygen mask
oxygen in there

yes
it's breathing apparatus
when firemen go into very hot smoky places they need some help breathing and they have masks on
and they carry big tanks with oxygen on their backs
which is what that is
but look there's a space there at the back of the fire engine for the oxygen cannister to stand so it doesn't get lost
that's not very kind „ is it
I saw that
did you say disappear and you threw the fireman into the air
you definitely said
ooh
you definitely said disappear „ didn't you
you definitely said disappear
and if I was a fireman I wouldn't help you out in a fire if that's your attitude
tossing him up and throwing him in the air
poor fireman

what are you singing
lotsof party
lotsof partys and crumbs on a plate
there aren't any crumbs
there are some crumbs on the floor because I haven't vacuumed yet
take your shoes and socks off
or your slippers
you're wearing slippers
look
we'll take the slippers and socks off
and your trousers
we'll get you changed
and then Mummy'll dress you and put your shoes on because we can go for a walk then „ can't we
well you're doing something now

I can see it but I don't needta feel it
I can see it's bulging
and I can see
no
you mustn't touch your nappie

oh dear dear
you did all that behind the chair „ did you
not pleasant „ is it
open wide
let's put it in the dustbin wagon
it as got to go somewhere
very smelly
Tom just don't mess with your legs when I'm trying to do this
otherwise we'll get it everywhere „ won't we
what will make you sore

well you might get very sore but it wouldn't come to that because I wouldn't let you walk round in it
if you're accidentally get sore you hafta go in the bath „ don't you
it doesn't really happen now but when you were a baby sometimes you'd been rolling all over the place
it was most unpleasant
but I think we've got past that really „ haven't we
now
you should be using the potty now
pardon
no settee
what do you mean no settee
right
just put your legs down now properly Thomas
that's it
legs down
there we are
put it in that plastic bag
a special nappie bag
ready for the dustbin man
that's right
get some cotton wool and put some lotion on
yes
Mummy'll wrap up the
no
put your legs down Thomas
please
no
I know you but it's not easy for me trying to clean you up
when you've got your nappie on you can do whatever you like with your
but while you're having your nappie done Mummy is in control you cheeky thing
you've got such a cheeky face Thomas Lastname
you've got a what face
a dirty face
you haven't because I gave you a lovely wash after lunch
you just seem to be extremely tired
I don't know what the matter is
you've been very quiet for a few days now
it isn't like you
mind you
I worry when you're quiet
I wonder what's the matter with my little boy
what did you say about washing up
leave me alone
oh is that what Mummy did
leave me alone
I'm washing up
is that what Mummy says
ah
no
I think the thing is sometimes Thomas
are we going to have a little talk now
Mummy and Daddy love to hear what you hafta say
we're always very interested
but there are times especially when Daddy comes home from work when you just need a few minutes together just so Daddy can tell Mummy what sort of day he as had
and so that we can tell Daddy if anybody as been on the telephone and things like that
and so sometimes when we say shh
Thomas be quiet
that's why
well because Mummy and Daddy hafta sometimes have a conversation
and if Daddy or Mummy says Thomas please be quiet it's usually something quite serious that we're talking about
and we don't wanna be interrupted
and there are times when you hafta be quiet
it's like music class
when you're in the music class with Julian when Julian's talking everybody hasta be quiet „ don't they
when Julian says shh everybody shhes
and it's the same at home
if Daddy says shh he's usually saying it for a reason
yes
somebody might be coming
yes
that's especially true when we've got visitors in the house
well visitors like to see you as well but sometimes it's a little bit rude if you go straight up and barge in when Daddy's having a conversation „ isn't it
sometimes you just hafta wait a few minutes
does that sound reasonable
and sometimes on the telephone it can be very difficult if they've got a bad line
if we've got a bad line we can't hear what's being said
and if you're going in the background it's very difficult to hear

but you're being quiet today
you've been quiet for a few days now
are you not feeling very well
you're just tired
what are you doing
the mixer
the mixer's in the bathroom
you've been playing with your toy mixer in the bathroom for the past few weeks
you've still got your dumper truck and the crane and all those sorts of things down here
no
well you've
true
you haven't got a crane but you've got toys that you pretend are cranes
that's something that we could put on your birthday list „ isn't it
we keep wanting ideas for birthdays
you need another toy box
you cheeky monkey
you probably will after your birthday
expecting a lot of presents „ are you

who said you might need another toy box after your birthday
Daddy
oh Daddy did
oh well as long as Daddy's going to buy it that's alright
did Daddy really say we'll need another toy box after your birthday
did he
when did he say that
he said what
in your tooth
I'm going to have words with that Daddy when he comes home tonight
