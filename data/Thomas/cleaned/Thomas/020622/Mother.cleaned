a green snake and an orange snake
yes
it as got rocking horses on it
Dobbin
not worry
Dobbin's a rocking horse „ isn't he
it says not suitable for children under thirty six months
as certain products may contain small parts and could prove hazardous causing choking if swallowed
well you're not thirty six months yet Thomas
so make sure you don't swallow any of these Thomas
I'd be quite surprised if you could get one of these in your mouth and swallow it
but still
oh and that's j
what's that for
JackintheBox
a JackintheBox
it jumps
it does
you open the lid and it goes pop
and out jumps the JackintheBox

he as jumped out
so look you've got the horse
where's the horse
galloping
and you've got the JackintheBox jumping
and you've got the fish swimming

and getting all this sticky stuff of the back
can you see though they've all got pictures on the front
but when you turn them over they're just plain „ aren't they
now this is l for it looks like perhaps it might be a lion
oh
what does the lion say
the lion's the king of the jungle
there's the king
but the lion's the king of the jungle
there are twenty six letters in the alphabet Thomas
and when you get halfway though you get to letter m

you've got a storybook about Tom and Pippo
when we went to see Grandma and Granddad the other week
another Pippo
Mummy saw this in her bedroom and she said to Grandma oh please could I take the monkey back with me because Thomas likes monkeys
I useta play with this when I was a little girl
so it's a very old monkey now „ isn't it
I think he actually needs a bit of a clean up Thomas
ah
look the monkey is picking up all the letters
ah
oh he didn't mean to throw it
that was an accident
he as got four paws you see
and he was getting a bit excited „ wasn't he
there you are
are you going to show the monkey the other monkey
are you playing with the letters

oh no be gentle with him Thomas
because look
they're all beautifully painted „ aren't they
and if they get damaged
show Pippo the monkey on the letter m
these are letters of the alphabet
what other letters do we know
what other letters
we have letters that PostmanPat brings „ don't we
but they're not letters of the alphabet
they're letters and cards and parcels
post
ah now what's this
this is n
can you see those on there
the letter n is painted yellow
but there are some things in black
do you know what they are
they're musical notes
so if you see a piece of paper with
oh that reminds Mummy
she as got to do
I don't know what I've done with my music
and I need that tomorrow night
I put it in a safe place Thomas
my music book
remind me when we've finished to look for that
my musical notes
if you see a piece of paper with
look let me draw some
they're called crochets and quavers
and semi quavers and things
look
there we are
if Mummy draws that
we can sing baa baa black sheep
because every drawing like that represents a different sound
baa baa black sheep
have you any wool
so if you see those they're musical notes
and you can sing them
oh now this is good
this is o for
o for breakfast

it's b for breakfast
it's o for

he's called an octopus
has he got a poorly leg
look
each of his legs says one two three four five six seven eight
poorly legs

each leg makes a different sound
that's full of beans
dried beans
you've got the one with the squeaker in it
this one hasn't get anything in it
but it's velvet
that feels very
and this one
the shiny one crackles
and that one has the jingle jingle in it
what about the others
this has the squeaker
the red and white check one has a squeaker
and the black and white check one has a squeaker
oh
do you remember that
the blue silky one plays a tune
and this one
the white one has little bobbles on it
and that's a textured one
that feels rough
rub your hands along that and feel that
it plays London bridge is falling down
and what's the other one it plays
press it again
falling falling down
London bridge is falling down
my fair lady
OldMacDonaldhadafarm
that's the second one
we don't know the name of that tune „ do we
it sounds a little bit like London bridge is falling down again
oh Thomas
when you were a baby you carried that octopus absolutely everywhere with you
and it looked so smart
because a lot of the babies had them
and some of them had had octopus that other babies had had
and they didn't look quite so bright
and yours useta stand out because it looked so shiny and new
and now look at it
it's grubby
isn't it
grubby
because it as been well loved
oh another letter of the alphabet now
that's p for
not for breakfast
it's b for breakfast
p for
no
p not b
p for
you're one of these
I often tell you you're one of these
a parrot
you're a parrot
aren't you
Thomas is a parrot
he is
you repeat things
and the next letter is q for queen
so we know have a king and a queen
is it stuck
is it no playing anymore
look
there's the king
dressed in blue
there's the queen
dressed in pink
a king a man and a queen's a lady
oh you like listening to that „ don't you
can you see what else is on the octopus
fish and stars
not stars
shells
and there's a mermaid
and what's that
is that a tortoise
oh you can hear it without putting it really close to your ear Thomas
I'm sure
we're going to hafta find a little box now to put these in
because now we've taken it out of the presentation box we can't store them in that again „ can we
what are you doing
you wanna
oh Thomas
I can hear it without putting it in my ear darling
thank you
if you keep pressing it it's going to wear it out
and then another day when you wanna listen it you're not going
pardon
pardon
I can't tell what you're saying
oh I can hear it darling
thank you
I said you liked this toy when you were a baby
you still like it „ don't you
look
r for
Purdie
no rabbit
it's a white rabbit
let's put the octopus there next to the monkey
and they can watch what we're doing
you often see rabbits in Teletubby land „ don't you
and who as got a rabbit
AuntieTrisha
look
and she brought you that
that rabbit
and what's that rabbit called
it's called Molly
oh Thomas
you're going to be upset
guess what s is
it's another snake
another snake
they could have done s for sheep „ couldn't they
I think they could have put a sheep on that seeing as they've put an adder on a
guess what Thomas
I'm looking at this now wondering whether a is actually an alligator
I think a is an alligator not a snake
I thought it was an adder
but now I've looked at s for snake I think definitely a is alligator not adder
what do you say to Daddy
see you later alligator
in a while crocodile
see you later alligator
in a while crocodile
no
don't hit them Thomas
you're being too rough
oh and after s it's t
t is for temple
they're choosing some funny things
oh not yet
they're choosing some very funny things
t for temple
now what do you think this one is
this is u
I think this must be unicorn
a unicorn
can you see it
I don't think we've got a tall unicorn „ have we
that's probably not a word you've come across before
I think on other alphabet things u is for umbrella
you've got some
you've thrown it down
what is it you want
Molly
the bee
the tape measure
Mummy round the face
oh we were doing this the other day „ weren't we
just a second
just a second
shall we see if we've grown since the other day
mind you I didn't write down what we measured the other day
let me see
whoa
much bigger than last week
we're getting near the end of the alphabet now Thomas
we've got w
there
w is for
it's not for breakfast
w is for whale
whale's a bit like a dolphin when you look at it on this picture
it swims in the sea
and x is for xylophone
you've got a xylophone in your music box „ haven't you
look
there's a xylophone
and it as got two sticks to play it with
ah
and yellow is what they've chosen for the letter y
they could have had a yacht
it's showing a picture of a yellow pencil
two ones
and it's
two oranges
two oranges
well it's yellow
it's a yellow pencil
which one would you like
ah
that's the one
that's the n with the musical note
so yes
they're painted in the same color „ aren't they
no
don't be rough with them Thomas
they're not for throwing „ are they
no
z
what's that
what's that
no
it's not Gordon
you're thinking of Gordon one of the ThomasTheTankEngine characters because it's green
it's a zebra painted black and white against a green background
hello zebra
some people say zebra
zebra
is that what you're going to say
zebra rather than zebra
I say zebra
now that is the very last of the alphabet
w x y z
but then they've got two other things in here
look
they've put two other wooden
two other wooden toys in the box
this one is a question mark
that's nice „ isn't it
you put one of these at the end of a sentence if you're asking a question like how old is Thomas
or did you have a cheese sandwich for your lunch
yes
and this is a pound sign
or is it a
yes
I think it's a pound sign
or it could be an and
sandwiches
it might be an and
and s a sign we use for
and to say
pick Purdie up at the cattery
pick Purdie up at the cattery
Purdie's not at the cattery anymore „ is she
I think Purdie's probably upstairs
look

you've dropped one
which one have you dropped
is it d for
