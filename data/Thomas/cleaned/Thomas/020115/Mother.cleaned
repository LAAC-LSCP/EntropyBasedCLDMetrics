yes
oh dear
has the train run into the beaker of juice
oh don't smack the poor driver
it's not his fault Thomas
no
it's not nice
there's not a lot of room on the highchair
and you've got it full with the plate and sandwiches some cheese biscuits and some juice
so it's hardly surprising the poor train hit the juice „ is it
no
give the driver a biscuit
he as probably had a very busy morning driving people
you drink your juice and a sandwich and a biscuit and you might feel better
all done
has he had enough
yes
I don't think the train wants to eat sandwiches
it's just the driver that can eat sandwiches
that's very kind of you to share your lunch with him Thomas
what are you trying to tell me
baby
where's the baby
oh baby's bib
no
now Mummy hasn't got a bib on „ has she
should Mummy be wearing a bib
oh no

I'll wear a bib like a baby if you promise to put
oh what about this one
this is red yellow and blue and it says
flowers grow in my garden
and it as got two huge flowers
and a picture of the sun
that's right
and it as got red strings „ hasn't it
yes
yellow flowers
that's right
there
nice
does Mummy's bib look nice
all done
what are you telling me
all done
are you listening to the sound of the juice in the beaker
it's making a squeaky noise „ isn't it
it sounds like there's some air trapped
are you enjoying your lunch Thomas
what's the matter
has the train driver fallen out of his seat
he as got a blue hat „ hasn't he
oh dear
the train as fallen on its side
so has the juice
whoops
and Mummy as dropped a piece of chicken
oh dear
mm
it is nice
have you had a nice time at the playgroup this morning
no
you're laughing as you say no though so I think you probably did
we had the musical instruments out at the playgroup „ didn't we
do you remember singing all those songs
you've got a short memory
and you had the drum round your neck on a piece of string „ didn't you
and a bright yellow maraca in one hand
and a tambourine in the other hand
you were very busy
you couldn't actually play
yes
I'm wearing a bib
the bib has picture of a teddybear and a box „ doesn't it
so because you had a card with an eight on the front
a big bear

is that the noise of the big bear
and you had a symbol in one hand
not a symbol
what is it
it's a tambourine in one hand
that's right
you couldn't play the drums „ could you
it was nice „ wasn't it
you shaking them
are you trying to butt the bridge using the back of the train
I know you've dropped one
I think the fruit juice is actually too big to go in the back of the train Thomas
don't you
it'll probably jump off and make a mess
mm
you're having a big drink
are you thirsty
it was quite windy this morning „ wasn't it
walking home
yes
the wind was blowing
it was quite hard to push the pushchair „ wasn't it
mm
and what did Thomas do this morning at the playgroup
what did we do
no
you didn't play with the blue football
we walked round and round the carpark „ didn't we
we were on sponsored walk
do you remember walking round all those chairs round that huge carpark
we were walking in aid of cancer research „ weren't we
no
you didn't have a blue football
but you went on your own
and you hadta set off from one chair and walk on your own all the way round the chairs in the carpark
and then when we got back you wanted to go round again so they let you go again „ didn't they
and you collected money for Becky because she wasn't well enough to walk
no
Joe and Becky couldn't walk „ could they
and you've been a clever boy
and you've raised a lot of money this morning „ haven't you
and your photograph should be in the paper next week
or it might even be at the end of this week
Thomas's photograph in the newspaper Thursday or Friday
no
I think it will be because the press man was there
and he took a photograph „ didn't he
the only problem was Thomas
when we were told to say cheese you kept turning round to see who was saying cheese „ didn't you
so you didn't really look at the cameraman
no
why do you keep talking about a blue football
did you play with a blue football and I didn't see you
you might have played with a blue football Thomas
but I didn't see you with one
why did you say the blue football
no blue football
right
you were kidding me about that blue football „ weren't you
yes
you were
there wasn't a blue football „ was there
no
a red football
no
I didn't even see you with a football this morning Thomas
are you joking with Mummy

Thomas when you've made a noise like that you say excuse me please
you can say oh dear choochoos but you should say excuse me please
you're too busy playing with trains to mind manners „ aren't you
mind manners
you can say mind manners but you can't say excuse me please
mind manners

I don't know what you were trying to say there
I thought you were trying to say mind manners but I don't know
is Thomas too busy to mind his manners
mind manners
you're seeing Grandma and Granddad tomorrow „ aren't you
Mummy goes to work tomorrow
so they're coming to look after you
are you going to be a good boy
I think when we've had lunch Thomas
we might go in the garden this afternoon if it doesn't rain
Mummy's going out this evening „ isn't she
Daddy as got to put you to bed tonight
mm
you can have a nice bath and then a drink of milk
and then brush your teeth and bed
a big splash and then sleep
that's right
you can read some storys as well
help
is that what the train driver's saying
pop
oh yes
can you see the toaster
when I put bread in the toaster it goes pop „ doesn't it
it's not turned on at the moment though
have you put the train on your head
yes
more juice
you'd like some more juice
you're very quiet
you must be very thirsty
it makes a funny noise that juice „ doesn't it
I think you've sucked all the air out of it
well if you have some more
no
don't throw it down
that's not a good boy „ is it
that's not nice
that's Mummy's fork and I'm still busy using it
no
that's dirty Thomas
it's Mummy's plate
yes
it's dirty because I've just had a meal
we'll hafta wash up „ won't we
that train driver is really busy
is he jumping in and out of his car
jumping between his cab and the roof of his train „ isn't he
jump
you were jumping with two little girls this morning inside the WendyHouse „ weren't you
and they were much older than you those two girls
and when you started jumping with them I don't think they didn't like it
and one of them told you to get out „ didn't she
but you didn't go
you just stood there and looked at her „ didn't you
chip shops
why are you talking about chip shops
dirty truck
can't see a dirty truck
and I don't know why you're talking about chip shops
and the blue truck
are you thinking about lotsof things that have happened recently
blue truck
yes
we've seen a blue truck but not now
and we've seen a green truck but not now
and we haven't been to the chip shop
oh we did this morning actually
we did see a white truck „ didn't we
when we were walking to playgroup we saw a white truck
and we saw some buss
yes
a blue bus
a magic bus
and a po bus
a red bus
was it dirty
dirty bus
ooh dirty truck
oh are you giving the train a cuddle
oh and a kiss
what a lucky train
we were going to take you on a train but then you were poorly „ weren't you
a few weeks ago
I think perhaps this week or next week we'll try and again „ shall we
a trip on the train
would you like that
we can go from EastDidsburyStation into Manchester or somewhere else
when we get into Manchester we could have a ride on a tram „ couldn't we
and then come home on the bus
that sounds like a fun day
no blue football
no
why do you keep talking about a blue football
what as happened to the blue football
football
yes Thomas
Mummy is going to start peeling an apple and a pear now
mm
apple and pear
you don't seem to be eating an awful lot Thomas
are you not hungry poppet
you can't eat a blue football
have you just filled up with juice
is that why you're not really hungry
you normally like lunch „ don't you
you eat a lot at lunchtime
have you made a mess
there we are
an apple and a pear
that's the peeler and the sharp knife
whoops
I nearly dropped it
whoopsadaisy
it's a pear
yes
Mummy's going to peel the pear „ isn't she
oh take the skin off
the skin on fruit is called peel
and we can eat it if we wash it but
yes
wash the pear
but certain things like bananas
you can't eat the skin on bananas
no
and oranges
you can't eat the skin on oranges
you can usually eat the skin on apples and pears
but when I'm preparing fruit for you we peel it „ don't we
so that it's softer
I'll cut it in half and then half again
now look
can you see inside
there's some seeds
and you can't eat those either
mm
so we're going to take them out
look
slice them with a knife
bananas
no bananas
today it's just a pear and an apple
what we could do one day Thomas
we could plant some pips from the middle of the fruit „ couldn't we
have we got some pots
yes
it is a bit messy because it's quite a soft
I'm going to wash the pear
just rinse it quickly under the tap
all done pear
it's all washed
and let me cut into smaller pieces for you
there we are
and so we could get some pots and some soil
because you've got a watering can and a trowel and a fork „ haven't you
and we could pop some soil in a pot and then some pips
orange pips and lemon pips
pot
pips
we could pop some pips in a pot
Po
yes
it's a red handled knife „ isn't it
that I'm using
there you are
there's the pear
I'm just going to rinse my hands and then I'll do the same with the apple
yes
washing my hands
drying them on the towel
is the pear nice
this is the fruit peeler
I'm going to take the skin off the apple
like we did the pear
when you're sharing Daddy's apple you always eat the peel „ don't you
it's very good for you
but when you're a little boy it's sometimes a bit kinder to your teeth to take the peel off
so that's why we do it
mm
you're holding your teeth again
are your teeth hurting you
it'll be nice to crunch an apple
look
we've cut the apple in half
and look
in the apple there are two pips
and that little bit hanging out
it's the stalk
this is an apple
apples and pears grow on trees
and they hang on the tree with a stalk
pear
you're going to see Grandma and Granddad next week
who live near York
that's my Mummy and Daddy
and they have apple trees and pear trees „ don't they
you probably don't remember because it's a long time since we've been in their garden
choochoo
can you hear the train
because when we last visited them it wasn't a very nice day „ was it
so I
that's right
I'm going to wash the apple under the tap
give it a quick rinse
and then we'll cut the apple into small pieces as well
and it'll go in the same pot as Thomas's pear „ won't it
this is apple
it looks very much like the pear
let's put pear to one side
pear can go on that side
and the apple on this side
the apple is slightly more yellow „ isn't it
oh yes
that's a sharp knife
be careful
there we are
the pear's a bit lighter in color than the apple „ isn't it
and the apple is a little bit more crunchy to chew than the pear
the pear's quite soft
there we are
cut it up
that's lovely „ isn't it
choochoos
have you put one train on top of the other
you've stacked your choochoos up „ haven't you
all done
that's right
you're still eating them so I'll take the peel away
yes
Mummy's fingers were just a little bit sticky so I've rinsed them under the tap
does that taste nice
nice fresh fruit
you had grapes at breakfast already „ haven't you
no
oh I think you did
it's not very warm today Thomas
is it
Mummy doesn't feel very warm
yes
when you've finished your lunch you can have a wash and get down
Mummy's just wiping the table because I've finished with the table
and there are one or two crumbs on it
so I've just got a cloth
I'm wiping down
yes
a blue dish cloth
that's right
mm
it's not really dirty Thomas
it as just got a few crumbs on it
oh your eyes look heavy

thank you very much
that's nice
have you finished
you don't want any more pear
you keep putting your trains in your hair „ don't you
you've not eaten an awful lot today Thomas
are you not feeling very well
oh you've eaten quite a bit I suppose
the whole time
you've eaten nearly half of it
I'll put it in a pot with a lid
and then this afternoon perhaps around three o'clock time when you usually have some milk you might like to have some apple and pear then
and then if you don't we can have it at teatime „ can't we
no
I think we can
whoopsadear
I've dropped the spoon now
let's put it in the red pot
pop it in the red pot
fasten the lid up
and put it in the fridge for later
oh the fridge needs a clean out Thomas
oh yes

would you like to finish these sandwiches
oh I think you've drunk your juice
although you did ask for a little drop more „ didn't you
right
what we'll do is pop a little bit of orange juice into this beaker
and the beaker has a picture of Simba the lion on it
just a small amount
a lion
what does a lion say

yes
a big bear

there you are
just a little drink of orange juice
yes
it's orange juice so it looks yellow „ doesn't it
now you put your straw in and be very careful
don't tip it up
yes

that's right
whoops
I knew you'd laugh then when I fell over the chair
I was too busy watching you with the juice to look where I was going
is that nice
now be careful
just little sips if you're going to hold the beaker up to your face
please may Mummy take her bib off now
because I've finished my lunch
no

I'll put it back on
I'll put it on
I'm sorry
I need the bib on anyway whilst I'm putting the sandwiches and biscuits back „ don't I

just be very careful with that Thomas
there you are
you've got it upside down
you needta put the straw
the straw in that way and the bendy bit goes near your mouth
but be very careful that you don't spill it
and then when you've finished your juice we're going to wash you hands and face
and you can get down
and then we'll think of something to do this afternoon

it's not hot
