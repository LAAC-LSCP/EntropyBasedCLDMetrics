it as suddenly turned into a bridge „ has it
a bridge to put your cars in
the big red bus
there's your bus
so Thomas
we haven't been into Mothercare yet „ have we
we'll try Mothercare and Boots
they might have some nice clothes
getting off
who's getting off
the passengers on the bus
and Mummy took some trousers back „ didn't she
because
because I ad bought some trousers the other day
watch out Lala
and the trousers didn't fit Mummy
so she as taken those back
can you see this
oh
I'm making a cup of coffee
this isn't the usual powder we use „ is it
it's in a bottle and you hafta squeeze it

how's that
nice cup of coffee
would you like a drink Thomas
or are you alright
you're alright
that's a good boy
I'm just going to hang these trousers back on a hanger
and then I'll think we'll have a look at your little doll
because we bought a doll a long time ago
what's the doll called
she's called Sue
and when we went into the shop we saw that there was some very nice little clothes for dolls
so I think if we measure Sue and see how big she is we could perhaps buy something for her to wear
because it's getting winter now
she'll be getting cold
have you
the yellow car as fallen on the floor „ has it
and if we find out what size Sue is and we buy her outfit Mummy could perhaps make her some more
because I'd know what size I was working to
we really needta buy Thomas some more jumpers or perhaps a cardigan
a cardigan would be nice
just a second
where as it fallen
on the floor
gosh Thomas
you've everything on the floor down here
there you are
pardon
big load
there's a policeman here
where as he come from
the police car
there are the firemen and the fire engine
you don't want the policeman in the police car
oh
we didn't see any fire engines or police cars when we went out today „ did we
we usually do
but we didn't see anything at all
everybody must be behaving themselves today in Stockport and Cheadle
because that's where we've been
where's Daddy at the moment
is he at work
at AllenHall
oh poor Daddy
he's at work
never mind
don't worry Daddy

oh I think they probably are dirty Thomas
if they're playing in the mud „ don't you
you're dirty if you play in the mud
and Purdie comes in with her paws dirty if she as been walking in the mud
it's not very nice today „ is it
nice day
no
it's not
it's terrible
there's no sunshine at the moment
where as it gone
where do you think the sun as gone too
dark moon
pardon
Sonia Isabelle and DaddyRod
yes
we saw them yesterday „ didn't we
Sonia had a book party
and we ordered some books „ didn't we
for Christmas
Mummy was just putting some rubbish in the dustbin
there we are
because we don't want smelly rubbish inside the house
a blue car
just a moment
let Mummy wash her hands
and then we're going to have a look at some things „ aren't we
together
what's this
well I was just reaching to see your dolly Sue
oh she hasn't got any clothes on
she must be very cold
she's quite small „ isn't she
I think some of those clothes we saw today at the shop look too big for Sue
do you know what this is
do you know what that is Thomas
it's a tape measure
you wanna hold it
there
that's nice „ isn't it
that's right
we're going to measure the dolly
the clothes we bought you today are age twenty four to thirty six months
check her bottom
you're measuring her bottom
twenty four to thirty six months
that's two to three years
but in some shops we've got to buy things that are three to four years
because you're quite a tall boy „ aren't you
those clothes we saw today said they fit dolly sixteen twenty inches
so let's get the tape measure
can you see the numbers
one two three four
you count
five six
why am I counting on my own
can you see each of these marks
that represents a number
and if we put the top of the measure on Sue's head
that's right
hold her still
and we measure down too her feet
no
she's only thirteen inches
oh dear
she needs to be that much taller
another five inches to fit into those clothes
yes
you can hold it
it's like a snake „ isn't it
and what color is it Thomas
what color are the numbers
brown
it's black and white
so Sue's a little bit too small „ isn't she
oh
oh we'll hafta see if the shop does clothes for dolls who are very small
oh she needs something now it's getting too winter
she as got this little jacket look
shall we dress her
do you wanna put her coat on
Mummy do it
oh you not going to help
there we are
what are those called
sleeves
she's putting her arms through her sleeves
and look the back just fastens up like that with velcro „ doesn't it
what's Sue doing
she's getting dressed
there we are
she wants her nappie on
alright
there we are
Sue's nappie is waterproof „ isn't it
can you hear it crackling
crackles „ doesn't it
it's made from plastic
has she got a big tummy
and big nips
she hasn't got a big willie
no
there we are
she's dressed
she looks better than when she didn't have any clothes on
but she still doesn't look very warm „ does she
what do you think she needs to make her feel warm
what do you think she needs Thomas
something
oh you've given her some things to play with
have you given her your cars
do you think the cars will keep her warm
no
no
she really needs some more clothes to keep warm „ doesn't she
she needs some trousers
and a jumper or a cardigan
and what about on her head
you wanna pick the tape measure up
do you think she needs a hat Thomas
to keep her head warm
no
right Sue
you going to measure Sue now
right
would you like me to hold it
you can manage
oh when you go out in winter we put on your hat
and your scarf and your coat
and some gloves
that's right
gloves
and who else was told to dress warmly or he'd catch a cold
do you remember the story
Pippo
that's right
the little toy monkey in the story
Tom and his toy monkey Pippo
they went out for a walk „ didn't they
and Mummy said you must dress warmly or you'll catch cold
so Tom said exactly the same to Pippo
you must dress warmly or you'll catch cold
and they fell in the mud „ didn't they
and when they came home they both hadta have a wash
and then what did they do
a warm drink
that's right
they sat round the fire
and they had a warm drink
there's Daddy's hat here
do you think Sue would wear Daddy's hat
it's a bit big really „ isn't it
that's the hat that Daddy wore when he was on his holidays
oh
that's much too big „ isn't it
much too big
what size should we get him
shall we try with the tape measure
let's see
that's right
oh you look cute
I hold the measure behind your ear
and put it round your head
and oh nineteen and a half inches
nineteen and a half inches
that's a big head Thomas
let's just measure it again
from your forehead
right round
well nineteen and a quarter
and shall we measure Sue's head
look
this is exactly where I measured your head
that's right
hold the measure there
and we'll put it round the top of her ears
right round
and it meets up there
oh Sue's
oh it as gone over her ears
eleven and a half
eleven and a half
and what's Mummy
watch out
do you wanna measure Mummy
well you put it round my head
oh that's round my neck
shall we put it round Mummy's head like this
we'll see who as got the biggest head
Mummy's twenty one and a half
that can't be right
let's just do you again
yes it is
you're nineteen and a quarter
and Mummy is
twenty one and a half
there's hardly any difference between your head and my head
do you think we're doing it right
Mummy's head
you wanna measure Mummy's head again
and shall we measure Thomas's wrist
let's get the measure and put it round your wrist
like this
like a bracelet
five inches
and do Mummy's
same place
you can pull it out
Mummy's seven inches
and what about DollySue
what's Sue
Sue is three inches
so you're two inches more than Sue
and Mummy's two inches more than you
you had your feet measured last week „ didn't you
do you remember going into the shoe shop with Grandma and Granddad
and did you see a man at the back of the shop with a machine
bang bang
was that the cobbler mending some shoes
somebody broken their shoes „ had they
and did they go to the cobbler to mend them
well shall we
head
you wanna measure Mummy's head again
oh that's round Mummy's mouth that
cheeky
what are you looking at
are you looking at Mummy
shall we measure Thomas's foot
that's what the lady in the shop did last week
but she didn't use a tape measure like this
she had a very fancy machine with lights on it
there we are sir
that's going to tickle „ isn't it
that tickle
and your foot's six inches long
let's measure Sue's foot
two inches
what about Mummy
Thomas poorly toe
you can hold it there
Mummy's still peeling from her holiday
look at Mummy's legs
I think Mummy's about ten
I can't really
oh that tickled
I think Mummy's about ten and a half
look here's one of your shoes
shall we measure a shoe
there we are
your shoes say seven inches underneath
and your foot was
did we say six inches
let's have a look
yes
about six inches
and what about your new
oops you nearly fell off your chair then
what about your new shoes
we've got to get these shoes cleaned up
because we walked through the park yesterday and all the mud „ didn't we
and your new shoes are seven inches
that's very strange Thomas
because your old shoes measure almost the same as your new ones
and yet you're old shoes are too small and your new ones are too big
that's very funny
but I tell you what
your new shoes
even though they're boots feel lighter than your old ones
have you
yeah
they're covered in mud „ aren't they
your new shoes say eight g
you take a size eight g
excuse me please
just a minute
I can't tell what your old shoes are
oh mind
you just nearly knocked Mummy's coffee over
we drew round some shoes „ didn't we
a long time ago
and we haven't got
no what sweetheart
well you can't put your shoes in the
what have we got now
are these Mummy's kitchen scales
we haven't weighed you for a long time
but the scales are up in the bathroom
so we still can't do that
but when we're measuring things Thomas
we can see what's small
and what's tall
and what's long
and what's short
and with scales like this we can see what's heavy
you enjoyed playing with those before „ didn't you
we've got some stones here
now
let's just put a weight on that side
and you put stones in here
and we'll watch the scale pan go down
oh
that's a big stone
shall we put some more weights on this side
there we are
put some more stones in until the scale pan goes down again
oh
the stones are heavier now than the weights
shall we put some more weights on
oh it as not gone down this time „ has it
let's take a weight off
and we'll put another weight back on
oh look now
can you see them balancing
is that to go on it's own
if we put one of your cars
you don't want me to put the car on there
no
what about the policeman
shall we put the policeman in
no
we needta clean your shoes
and I think we needta clean the scale pan as well
because it's brass
it looks a bit grubby „ doesn't it
a bit dirty
there are some more weights here
do you remember when we used these scales before
we were doing some baking „ weren't we
we were seeing how heavy and how
yes
that's called balancing Thomas
when that needle's in the middle
can you see
when that needle's in the middle it means the scale pans are equal
you've dropped a stone
watch your foot
but if you put something in one side
put something in one of the pans
that's right
you've put a weight on that side
and can you see what as happened to the needle now
it as gone done
because it's heavy at that side
and if you put something in this side you can see it balance
it's still heavy
excuse me
heavier at one side „ isn't it
you're fascinated with those scales „ aren't you
no
they haven't broken
let's put some stones on this side
pardon
we could do some weighing with some Smarties „ couldn't we
and some buttons
I'm just going to wipe the scale pan out
because we don't wanna put any food in if we've just been playing with stones
a lot of sweetie shops Thomas
especially the old fashioned ones
you can go in and ask for some sweets
oh I ad better get some Smarties that are open
and then you go into the shop and instead of being in a packet like this they weigh them out for you
right
we'll put a little weight on there
Smarties
and buttons
oh
now we've got half an ounce there
we must get some metric weights
we're all pounds and ounces still
oh now
you tell me what as happened now
where's the needle
on that side
do you wanna put some more buttons in there until it balances
oh
that's a lot of buttons
now if we put another weight on the other side
now that side's heavier
I think you'd need an awful lot of things in this scale pan now to balance it
oh no
don't put stones in with the Sweeties
shall we just take some of the weights off there
we'll see how many stones it takes to balance the sweeties
instead of using the weights
look
one stone
two stones
three stones
look
no you don't wanna weigh some stones
sweets
you'd like a sweet
oh would you
you're having a Smartie „ are you
well I'll have a chocolate button in that case
mhm
what do you think s heavier
a smartie or a chocolate button
you feel them
you've a Smartie in one hand
chocolate button in the other
I think the Smartie's heavier „ don't you
does the sweet in this hand feel heavier than the sweet in that hand
but when you look at them Thomas
the chocolate button is big and the Smartie is small
but the Smartie's heavier
and the chocolate button's light
mm mm
this is the bit you like „ isn't it
shall we put some of them back in the bag
no
oh I think we should
I think we should put a lot of those back in the bag
Thomas do it
Thomas can do it
yes
you useta hafta go and see Patsy when you were a baby
to be weighed
we've not seen Patsy for a long time „ have we
do you wanna put
do you wanna put some more in the scale pan
chocolate buttons
what
what do you say
so who's bigger
Thomas or Sue
Thomas is big and Sue's small
which one's bigger
Thomas or Mummy
which one's big
Mummy or Thomas
is Mummy big
is Thomas small
so Thomas is bigger than Sue
and Mummy's bigger than Thomas
and who do you think s heavier
is Thomas heavier than Sue
and is Mummy heavier than Thomas
and what about long
long and short
has Thomas got long hair
Thomas has got quite short hair
but when you look at Sue
Sue as got no hair at all „ has she
no hair at all
so Thomas has more hair than Sue
she as just got a head
she hasn't got any hair
and when we look at the Teletubbies
who's tall
Dipsy or Po
who's the tallest
which one's tall
is Dipsy tall
and Po's the baby „ isn't she
she's small
and Dipsy's fatter than Po „ isn't he
is he wider
he's wider
let's have a look at the measure again
that's really long „ isn't it
a long tape
if we fold it like this
you're eating the sweets „ are you
if we fold it like that that's not very long now „ is it
is that short
that short
and is this long
is that long
is that long
it is
it is
that's ever so long
what's the rhyme we know about the elephant
another weight
yes
that's right
are you stacking the weights up and building a tower
you don't want the buttons
in the big blue packet
are you going to weigh out some more sweets
what have I done with them
where've I put them
oh there they are
there you are
you can weigh the buttons into
into that
and where's the empty Smartie box
here it is
Smarties
where've the Smarties gone
I think they've gone in your tummy
and that tummy's going to be really big
don't you think it's going to be very big
I think it is
Mummy what
read it
the packet
the button packet
what does it say
you're weighing the empty Smartie box now
I'm trying to think about the song about the elephant Thomas
it's something about him being terribly tall and terribly fat
do you remember that
when we look at a picture of a tiny mouse
it's very small „ isn't it
compared to an elephant
an elephant's really big
the elephant walks like this and that
he's terribly tall and terribly fat
nose
I think but I can't remember the tune
we sang it yesterday „ didn't we
the elephant walks like this and that
he's terribly tall and terribly fat
he as got no fingers and he as got no toes
but goodness gracious what a big nose
that's a
that's right
a big one and a baby one
you're holding weights in your hand and you're saying a big one and a baby one
it's like shoes „ isn't it
look at your shoes
here's your shoe
and there's Mummy shoe
can you see
which one's big and which one's small
all done playing now
you bored now
yes
shall we put scale pan away
okay
oh he's
no
you can't lift that
because that's very heavy „ isn't it
very heavy
thank you
some thing's are very heavy and some things are very light
that's very heavy „ isn't it
Isabelle's Daddy is very tall „ isn't he
he's a big tall man „ isn't he
he's not really fat though „ is he
he's a thin man
and Isabelle's very tall
and you're very tall
what about dolly Sue
dolly Sue's not tall „ is she
she's small
there we are
shall we stand these up
that one's big
so that goes at the bottom
shall we put that one there next
which one goes next
that one
right
and then which one
two ones
which ones
that one
and that one
another one
that one first
and then
another one
look
that's a tall tower with all those weights
I'll just give the scale pan another wipe
there
oh look
well we're putting it back in the kitchen now
thought you ad said you ad enough
do you wanna hold the packet of Smarties now
it's empty
can you feel how light that is
what are you looking for now
oh this one
we've got two packets of Smarties
you feel one with the Smarties in
that's heavy
now feel that one with no Smarties in
that's light
isn't it
one's full and it rattles
and one's empty and it doesn't make a sound when you shake it „ does „ it
a red lid
yes
because they've each got letters on them „ haven't they
shall we have a look in this net
look
I've been collecting them
one of these little nets that the washing powder tablets come in
we use them for all sorts „ don't we
there we are
oh look
wow
yes
I've found a button in there „ as well
from a dress
yes
all those are lids
excuse me
from tubes of Smarties
they're nearly all green „ aren't they
that lid comes off
yes
this one doesn't though
because it's still sealed up „ isn't it
look
they've all got different letters on them
we were collecting them until we had a full set
but I don't think we're going to have
we've got
it goes in that one you think
we've got b and c and e
we've got two bs
different shades of green
and c
and an e
you're putting them there „ are you
and f
two fs
both the same color green
whoops
and an i
two is
again both greens but different colored green
and a j
and then when we go to two ns
an r
and a p
well we should say p and then r
because it goes that way round the alphabet
no thanks
you've got to get through a lot of Smarties before we've got a full alphabet Thomas
and if you notice when you buy the tubes of Smarties the lids are on that way
so all it says is Smarties
it's when you open them and take them off that you know what letter you've got
so we could go through packets and packets of Smarties „ couldn't we
before we find a full alphabet
what can you see on the box of Smarties
not see a thing
can you not see a thing
I can see lotsof Smarties
I've got the one that rattles
what shall we make
hold it
I'll hold the thing
it's a tube
it's a tube of Smarties
what shall we make
a strawberry milkshake
shake
shake
shake
oh are you going to take the lid off the sweeties
have you been putting all the lids inside the tube
ohgosh
well that's a good place to store them „ isn't it
we needn't bother with the little net bag
are you going to count them as you're putting them in
no thanks
oh alright
whoops a daisy
Mummy pick it up
there you are
I think it's nearly time for you to have a drink of milk „ isn't it
you're enjoying doing that
are you posting the lids into the Smartie tube
anything that involves posting you like „ don't you
is it stuck
Mummy sort it out
they all stuck
gosh
they are stuck
would you like them all out again
I'll hafta bang it on the table
oh dear
they are stuck „ aren't they
oh dear
oh dear
there we are
oh
for a moment I thought they were going to come out
if we can get one out we can manage to get the rest out
you try shaking it
are they really stuck Thomas
Mummy sort it out
well that's the thing
if you put something very large into a very small space it gets stuck
this is what we said about Purdie's whiskers
Purdie has whiskers on her face because if she's going somewhere small and her whiskers get caught she knows that she's going to get stuck as well
oh you find that funny „ do you
thought of poor Purdie getting stuck
ah poor Purdie
it's really well and truly stuck „ aren't they
oh there we are
that's the policeman
well he's probably good as well
there's the fireman
are you going to ask him for help
help please
you're laughing because Purdie's stuck
no
Purdie's not stuck
if Purdie was stuck up a tree the fireman might come
do you think he would
oh we've nearly got them all out
you're sorry
what are names for things that are very large
we've got wide
we've got big
thanks policeman
are you thanking the policeman for helping
there you are
you have a go
you've got the red one stuck
can't get it out
that's like when we're posting letters
you can only post things through a slot if they're small enough to go through
and if not we've got to bend them in half to make them smaller „ haven't we
it's still stuck
can you manage
are they still stuck Thomas
are you asking him for help
help with Purdie
you want the ladder please because Purdie as got stuck
help me please fireman
not worry
well he'd only need his ladders if Purdie got stuck up at tree
and he hadta climb up high to rescue her „ wouldn't he
if Purdie got stuck in something if she ad gone in somewhere because she was too fat that's why she got stuck
he wouldn't need his ladders
he might need his cutting equipment to cut her out
and then we'd hafta take her to the vet's „ wouldn't we
what would the vet say
oh poor Purdie
ah
do you think the vet would feel very sorry for her
I think he would
well there's the fire engine look
get the ladder
is he going up and down the ladder
the ladders for me please
you asking him to get the ladders for you
oh Purdie
silly Purdie
I'm quite sure the fireman have a lot of important things to do putting out fires
they probably get a little bit cross when they're called out to get a pussy cat who's stuck down from a tree „ don't you
but then if they're firemen who like pussy cats perhaps they don't mind too much
