you cause it smells quite nice this
it smells like breakfast „ doesn't it
right come on turn round sit at the table properly please
good boy would you like a fork
well I thought seeing as it was the first week of school
it would be nice to send little cards to people like Anthony and Samara and Matthew and Alan
and all those people just to say
thinking of you and how's your first week been
and some people I mean one or two are not starting anyway
for a couple of weeks yet
think it was Matthew isn't starting until the seventeenth
which is two weeks time
but it would still be nice to say we're thinking of them
cause we are thinking of them „ aren't we
I know I've been thinking about Anthony alot
and I sent cards to MrsRichardson
the head teacher at MerseyVale and Miss
and MissLongsdale
just to say that we were thinking about them as the term started
because this time last year you were in their nursery class and this year you're a big school boy
but I was thinking about the start of term
because they'll have a new set of children „ won't they
just think of nursery where you were last year
in the home corner
and the train track
you know the train track that was on the floor
all those will now be played with by new children
apart from Alice she's still at MerseyVale
and she was there with you last year „ wasn't she
we should ask Alice what's going on „ shouldn't we
actually talking of Alice you've been invited to a party
mm just let me run and get my handbag Thomas
because it's over there
I can't remember what it said
got it
we're going to be a busy boy on the twenty well busy boy we're all going to be busy on the twenty second of September Thomas because

and then we've got this invitation today
from oh it's a look it's a Tweenies invitation is same as yours

all this invites you to play at their party
oh that's odd oh I remember these invitations
but I think it means at the Tweeneys party
on Saturday the twenty second of September
two o'clock until four o'clock
so you'll come from Daniel's party and go straight to Alice
at SaintJohn's CommunityCentre HeatonMersey
that's where you had your party
and then when that's finished
at four o'clock we've got to get in the car and drive to York
because at eight o'clock that night
we're going to a wedding reception
Mummy's nephew
Mummy's nephew gets married next week on wednesday
in Cyprus to Claire
in fact I'm going to the airport on Tuesday morning Thomas
to wave AuntiJanet and UncleStewart off
do you remember last week we went to the airport and Paul and Claire had already gone that day „ hadn't they
oops there's the phone
yes
yes just a second
I can't think what we were talking about before the phone went
oh the planes
you said when we get lotsof money can we buy one of the planes
we had a fantastic day on monday „ didn't we
at the airport
what happened
well we went to the airport very early in the morning
it started off in fact last monday „ didn't it
when we went to Picadilly station
to collect MrsMaybury
grandma and grandad's friend
from her train that came from York
when she came back here and spent the night with us on monday „ didn't she
and it was mummy and daddy's wedding anniversary
and we had a really special meal „ didn't we
candles and flowers and
and then early tuesday morning
we went to the airport and she boarded a plane
where was she going to Thomas
she was going to Canada it wasn't home
and she was in a wheelchair „ wasn't she
and we had a cup of tea with her and then at half past nine
the gentleman from the air
do you know
oh look what I'm having
thank you darling I will
man from the airport took her „ didn't he
in a wheel chair onto the plane
we waved goodbye
and we dashed from terminal two to terminal one to wave her off
and her plane was due out at ten at twenty past ten or was it quarter past ten
quarter past and at twenty past ten
what happened
the plane reversed and then it stopped
and it and it and it stopped
and we were waiting at the the viewing point
car park level thirteen „ weren't we
then it's eleven o'clock and the plane still hadn't moved
so we decided to go and find out what was happening
and we were at the airport a very long time
in fact we had lunch at the airport „ didn't we

and we went to the shop
we did all sorts of things
and what had happened to her aeroplane
it still hadn't gone but what did we find out had happened to it
a bird hit the plane and knocked the radar out
well a radar's the thing that guides the plane in the sky
it's the thing that guides it in the sky
from Manchester airport all the way to Canada
so she couldn't fly and in the end they were taken off the plane
and taken to the HolidayInn
and she spent the night there „ didn't she
cause it was too late to fly
and we then got straight
time all we left the airport at two o'clock
the train straight to Picaddily
where we went to buy some new school boy trousers „ didn't we
short school boy trousers in Marks and Spencers
and what did we do in Marks and Spencers
mm
your space rocket
and what's your space rocket
press the button and it goes
it's the lift „ isn't it in Marks and Spencers the glass lift
and it goes ever so fast and what does it do to your tummy
it does it makes your tummy go all over the place

his tummy's trapped in the doors

aw
I think you'd have a thin tummy if it was trapped in the doors
unless it was trapped and it had swollen up
perhaps it was swollen with all the bruising from being trapped
so we'd had a busy day „ didn't we
but the same day as MrsMadely to Canada
your cousin Paul my nephew and his fiancé Claire
got a plane from terminal one
at seven o'clock in the morning to Cyprus
and they get married on Wednesday the twelfth
and AuntieJanice and UncleStewart
and Claire's parents and brothers and sisters
are all going next tuesday
to Cyprus and Mummy's got to go first thing in the morning
back to the airport to wave them off
and Daddy's taking you to school on tuesday
because they fly at nine o'clock and you start school at nine o'clock
and I can't be in HeatonMersey by at the school gate
and waving people off at the airport
so daddy's taking you on Tuesday to school
I'll pick you up
oh
guess what's happening on Tuesday
Jeannine's coming

no
next week
after
well no
not after tomorrow in a few days
next week
next Tuesday she's coming
after the day I said
mm
yeah
well no
the day I'm talking about it's the same day
when we go to the airport first thing in the morning and you go to school and then I pick you up from school and we come home
Apple will be waiting for us
if that's us
well I don't think I've really got pennies for that Thomas
cause you
we had binoculars „ didn't we to watch the plane
I'll see but I haven't really got enough pennies at the moment Thomas
I hafta buy school uniform and new shoes and things
I think the best thing would be if perhaps in a few weeks time we have a trip to the air port and you could choose one you like yourself rather than me buying them
cause that would be another trip to the airport
we could go on the the train
when you grow up to the roof you can buy anything
well if it's you're money you can buy what you want
but Mummy's money I hafta be very careful with it cause I've got to buy food got to pay for the house and all sorts of things
now listen
it's Daddy's birth day in October
and it's Grandma and Grandads and UncleMike and AuntieMabel
so you're going to hafta save up pocket money
not that you get pocket money but we'll hafta start saving our pennies to buy daddy a present

to walk to school do you enjoy walking
that's your dustbin wagon is it
what's the matter Purds why is she crying she's sad
she's not here
I've not put the chair on her though „ have I
is she just crying

perhaps she's just crying to say hello to let us know she's there
you sure you've had enough to eat love
what have you got in your mouth another sausage you silly you

you're a sausage pincher „ aren't you
mm
glad you are eating it's nice
no leave Purdie
Thomas
we better go to the dentist soon you know
I think it's time that they had a look at your teeth they're perfectly alright as far as I'm aware
did the dentist come and look at you at nursery before you left nursery
they're all right was it a man or a lady
and what did he say
did he
how come I was never told that he'd been
I know he was coming and
mm
black teeth yes
oh no you haven't got black teeth no
sorry I thought you said do you know black thought you were saying no black teeth
did anybody at nursery get
no
did anybody at nursery get told they didn't have nice teeth
Thomas was anybody told they didn't have nice teeth
he didn't have nice teeth Alex
Alex had two teeth out

don't hurt her chin
I think Purdie missed you while you've been at school Thomas
on Wednesday she wandered round the house looking a bit lost

Thomas I'm eating crisps
mm
when you useta go to nursery you were only out of the house two and a half hours „ weren't you
and then you were at home with me but I think now we leave home really early in the morning we leave home about quarter past eight and you're not home until nearly four o'clock
plus you were
think of all the weeks you've not been going to nursery during the school holidays she's had you at home every day
so I think perhaps if you'd just increased your hours from nursery to school she wouldn't of missed you but

go that's it

that's what I mean it must have been a storm or something for them to blow down was it very windy
oh dear it must have been
so before Mummy and Daddy were married when Mummy went on holiday I useta take Purdie to Nanna and Grandad Bilbey's for them to look after
and you know the little basket that we now use to take her to the vets they useta strap her in there and she useta come on the train with me
mm to York
two cat tickets now I didn't hafta pay for her but she useta sit on my knee

and then I just useta put the basket out we useta try and get seat „ didn't we Purdie
she's looking at me now we useta try and get a seat you know on the train where they have tables
I useta sit there while
she's going to come and sit on my knee now
and I useta put her basket
oh Purdie oh that wasn't very good „ was it
and what she did she jumped on my skirt instead she fell straight through the middle of it oh poor Purdie oh did it
so I useta sit her on the table Thomas in a basket and then she'd be able to see me and see out of the window so she was very good actually on the train she never caused a fuss
she was very good and alot of people useta stop to talk to me and children I never thought about this actually but Mummys useta bring children down the carriage to come and see me
and I struck up a very nice conversation once with an elderly gentleman and his wife about Purdie and they were telling me all about the pussy cat that they had in their house
and one day when I was waiting at the station a lady came and said she'd had a pussy cat that looked just like Purdie and one day she'd gone out and left the pussy cat in the house and their washing machine caught fire yes darling the washing machine caught
and there was a fire in the house and the pussy cat was inside
no

in the end the fireman thought well something better follow them then what happened
