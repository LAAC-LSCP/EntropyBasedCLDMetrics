yes
I think the lights are on Thomas
aren't they
they should be
yes
they are
let me lift you up
look down there
orange and green lights
you wanna see again
and then it's breakfast time
oh good boy
that's a new one
is that what you're saying
let's see „ shall we
no
you don't
no
come on
it's breakfast time Tom
what don't you like
taking things
oh no
eating things
you don't like eating things
oh I'll remember that when you ask for sweets
oh Thomas I didn't think you liked eating sweets
is that what I shall say
ah ha
can I have a kiss please
I can't
oh poor Mummy would like a kiss
that's not nice „ is it
who's a stupid woman
ah that's not a nice thing to say
oh it's not funny Thomas
it's a really naughty thing to say
Mummy doesn't like that
I don't like you saying that
no
you don't have diet coke at breakfast time
you can have that at lunch
it's breakfast now
I'll get you some orange
it tastes of lollies
oh that sounds nice
there we are
we haven't had any blackcurrant juice for awhile „ have we
your lolly drink
do you like lolly pops
you crunch them as well
do you mean ice lolly pops or do you mean the lolly pop that Grandma gave you
well that was a mistake really because we went to the sweetie shop and you bought some jelly snakes
and I saw some little lolly pops that they useta have in the sweetie shop when I was a little girl
small round hard ones that are sort of powdery crunchy
almost tasted like Refreshers on sticks
and they also has some yellow and orange ones with more like a boiled sweet on a stick
with pictures of fruit on
oranges and lemons
and I saw those and I thought well if you're having jelly sweets I'll treat myself to some sweets
and I brought them home and hid them in the cupboard
and then when I came home from work Grandma had found them and thought they were yours
and had given you one of the lolly pops
it nearly broke one of your teeth „ didn't it
and I bet you didn't tell Grandma they were for me
so I've hidden them again
did she
she said especially for you
well I'm sure it didn't do you any harm
but they're just a bit hard
and you like ice lolly pops „ don't you
ice lollies
and what about ice cream
mm mm
do you like ice cream when it as got chocolate in the middle
well not in the middle
on the top
a flake
you like bowls of ice cream with strawberries „ don't you
is that all you're going to say mm mm
right ThomasHenry
what are we having
no
come on
talk properly
what would you like
oh well if you say that you won't get anything
shall we have some RiceKrispies then we can hear then snap crackle and pop
you think so
I think that would be rather nice
I think I'll have cornflakes
you don't mind „ do you
is she
I know you do
you're getting on much better with Purdie now
do you
you love her tummy
yes
that's yours
would you like some milk on
well you're getting on much better with Purdie because you're treating her gently
and when you treat her gently she's not frightened and she doesn't run away
she stays with you
in fact I was looking at you this morning
you've had a nice cuddle „ haven't you
hm
when you first got up
did she cuddle you
she huggled you
that's your special word
it's a cross between cuddle and huggle „ isn't it
cuddle and hug I mean
oh don't put that in your mouth
Thomas dirty
you sillybilly
that's the top of the milk bottle
it's all yuck
who's a TinkyWinky
yes
I'm a papa „ am I
what's a papa
I beg your pardon
I couldn't hear you
I was running some water
what did you say
yes
I don't see really
no
what are you talking about
if you bang bottles like that they crash
oh well I've completely lost it now Thomas
I know you're talking about fire now
sorry love
I don't understand
I tell you what Thomas
your Daddy tidied out the food cupboard the other day and he said
he didn't realize we had so much chocolate in the cupboard
and he's on a diet
and I've noticed that the only bar of chocolate I knew about has disappeared
do you think he as hidden it so he's not tempted to eat it
or do you think he as eaten it himself
no
in his tummy
don't say that
you think Daddy as eaten it „ do you
I think he as probably eaten it
dingalingaling
I'm looking at the calendar because I'm not quite sure what date it is
oh dear
is it the twenty seventh
let's have a look
Thursdaythetwenty seventh
it is
I'm taking Purdie to the vets tonight at quarter to six
she's not very well „ is she

and it's Mummy's friend Ruth's birthday today
ah yes
when it's Mummy's birthday we have a nice time
and that's not for a while yet
but Mummy's friend Ruth lives in America
that's a long way away „ isn't it
Mummy's friend Ruth lives in America
I said that's a long way away
you probably don't remember now but we went about four weeks ago to buy her a birthday card
yes
that's right
you get letters to America by going in an aeroplane in the sky „ don't you
so we hadta post that card a long time ago
a white postbox
where's there a white postbox
you're eating your RiceKrispies and then you'll talk about it

oh that's a good boy because you know you haven't got to talk with your mouth full „ don't you
and it was
DidsburyStation
is there
on DidsburyStation there's a big white post box
I've not seen it
are you sure it's a postbox
you're not thinking of the RoyalMailBox where Mummy said the postman leaves his letters „ are you
yes
Gingerweasel
oh the ginger pussy cat's there
he's just walking through „ isn't he
what do you call him
Gingerweasel
you're kissing my feet
huggling my feet
it was Dimitra's birthday on Tuesday
in America
no
not in America
Dimitra's in Greece
that's also a long way away and you needta get an aeroplane to get there
do you wanna get there and to find Dimitra
dark and horrible in there
what
in the aeroplane
oh in the woods
yes
do you
you need your torch to see what's happening because it's dark and horrible in the woods
do you think there are big bears in the woods
are your RiceKrispies nice Thomas

are the RiceKrispies nice darling
what's the matter
you want a peeppeep
what's a peeppeep
a blue box at DidsburyStation
are you talking about DidsburyStation or BurnageStation or are you talking about the station you go to with Grandma and Granddad
ah well if it's the station with Grandma and Granddad I don't know which one that is you see
well I think it's called RoadStation
and what happens on a Wednesday Grandma and Granddad go to B and Q „ don't they
and you park the car
after you've done your shopping in B and Q you go and look at the trains „ don't you
RoadStation
but Mummy as never been there

it's still raining and sweaty
what do you mean it's still raining and sweaty
yes
a wet windmill
the windmills are blowing round this morning „ aren't they

blowing around in the wind
if you're a very good boy today we'll finish our breakfast today with a little bit of EasterEgg
well you didn't get them for your birthday
you got them for Easter „ didn't you
for once Easter was after your birthday this year
quite a long while after your birthday
last year you were two on EasterSaturday „ weren't you
and this year you had your birthday right at the beginning of April
on the third
and Easter was the weekend just gone „ wasn't it
twenty something of April
so about twenty days this year in between your birthday and Easter
the sun's quite nice „ isn't it
Mummy's sister AuntyJanet was born on the twenty sixth of March which is a little bit before your birthday
whenever Easter useta fall near her birthday people useta give her Easter eggs instead and birthday presents
and she useta get upset
on a worm
well no
she just useta get a bit upset because she felt she should have had a birthday present for her birthday and an Easter egg for Easter
not an Easter egg for both
you've been lucky because you got presents for you've been given EasterEggs
so that's lucky „ isn't it
Mummy's going to make some crumpets now
would you like one
what am I talking about
who knows Thomas
I shall show you
this is what I'm talking about
you can always have a piece of bread or a piece of toast instead
look
do you like those
yes
would you like one with honey or a piece of cheese
honey
we've no jam today
I don't know where the jam as gone to but it's not in the fridge
come back jam
don't let me forget I've put those in the toaster „ will you
they burn quite easily
if I put them in the toaster and forget about them they'll burn
I don't think it will pop up quite like it does when I put ordinary bread in it
mm I enjoyed that
did you enjoy yours
there you are
there's quite a lot left
did you hear them go snap crackle and pop when you put the milk on
I forgot to listen „ did you

you forgot to listen as well
there you are
oh we just must have been talking about something else and forgot to listen
oh the honey as gone a bit hard „ hasn't it
I'll give it a good shake
where does honey come from Thomas
bees
you can
buzzybees make honey
you smell that
does it smell very sweet
it feels alright
it's just very sticky
you smell that
does it smell sweet
and nice
well bees make honey
well they live in hives and they make honeycomb
bees and wasps can both sting you
but a bee makes honey so we've got to look after bees and protect them
they're a little bit like Purdie Thomas
if you don't get all flustered when you see a wasp and a bee they'll just pass you by and not bother
but if you start lashing out they get a bit frightened
and then they get cross
and that's the time they might sting you
so it's much better when you see them just to ignore them
what's that noise
sim what does that mean
oh you're pretending to be an aeroplane now „ are you
would you like to try some honey Thomas
or would you just like some butter on this
just butter
margarine
what's from Tesco
the margarine
it is Tesco's sunflower spread
you're quite right
you can recognize the sign for Tesco „ can't you
and the other thing you know the
well you know all sorts of things
like Marks and Spencer and JohnLewis and Sainsburys
you can recognize all those
B and Q
and the lorry we saw
what was the lorry
the orange and white lorry like the one David and Sharon bought you
what letters of the alphabet were on that lorry
what alphabets
the letters of the alphabet
T N T lorry
the letter t
the letter n
and another letter t
you'd like your cheese now
you see it's very crumbly
it's Lancashire cheese
oh you want your T N T lorry
I thought you said you wanted your cheese
no Thomas
don't say things like that
I think that's an awful thing to say
it's not funny
Thomas
I haven't got any
you mean the little strip cheese
the little strips of DairyLea
I'm sorry but you ate them yesterday
you should have saved some
yes
but you didn't „ did you
I'm having honey
would you like some honey
have you tried honey
well how do you know you don't like it
you don't like buzzy bees because they sting you
they do but only if you upset them
most of the time bees are working very hard
making honey they sell in Tesco
who likes honey
WinniethePooh
just try some please
not yuck
it's really nice and sweet
well if you have a bit of that I'll get your lorry
you can have the post lorry as well if you like
but I'd like you just to have a bite of that
and try it
and then you can tell me you don't like it
would you
this hasn't got any on
that's just a plain crumpet
would you like a piece of toast
with black jam
do you mean Marmite
okay
you just said it
I just heard you say Marmite
that sounds like the bus song
Marmite
the margarine's smashed
right
I'll pop you some toast in the toaster
well will you finish those please
you're not hungry
there's no EasterEgg Thomas
I'm sorry
in T N T the t stands for Thomas „ doesn't it
what's that
are you going to eat cheese
eat your cheese please
go on it's nice
no
that popped up quickly „ didn't it
eat your cheese please
oh has something happened to the wheel
oh dear
I think it's because it keeps being dropped Thomas
you think David and Sharon'll hafta buy you another lorry
no
UncleBrian mended your post lorry when the wheel went wrong on that „ didn't he
and that's because you dropped it
right
will you please eat that cheese Thomas
now
come on
because if your lorry gets dirty we'll hafta get rid of it
yes
the dustbin men will collect it and take it away „ won't they
in the dustbintip
the rubbish tip
is that where they'll go with it
would you
if we threw it away you'd chase the dustbin lorry and you'd hop in the back and get your T N T lorry back
what
oh the little man would carry you because you couldn't see very well
there you are darling
I think you would need your torch „ wouldn't you
to see what's going on
do you really not want that piece of cheese
you're going to eat your toast „ aren't you
what has you
I'll try
what have you got in that lorry
have you
hm
wow
oh Thomas this cheese is nice
I don't want you to thank me
I want you to try some
isn't it
what do you think the T N T lorry was doing in Didsbury
do you
do you think it was delivering lots and lotsof newspapers
oh look
there's a Magpie on the fence outside
it as just flown away
sorry
just as I said it it flew away so you couldn't see it
you were telling Joe that you'd seen a Magpie „ weren't you

well done
how did you fix it
oh I see
you gave it a bang „ did you
did you bang it with your fist
yes please
he jump in there and get

oh thank you
oh wow
thank you
he did have a newspaper in there
thank you
I would imagine the T N T lorry when it carry newspapers carries stacks and stacks of newspapers all bundled up in piles
Daddy does buy a newspaper everyday so I'm sure he'd be grateful
no more newspapers
oh no
what's going to happen to Daddy
he'll hafta go to Tesco and buy one
oh it's empty „ isn't it
perhaps Daddy could read my newspaper when I've finished with it
we could share „ couldn't we

just you and Purdie could read it as well if you wanted to
well Daddy wouldn't know because Daddy's at work
so if a read it and then you read it and then Purdie read it
as long as it was waiting for Daddy to read when he came home he wouldn't know we'd read it before him „ would he
and then after Daddy had read it we could say thank you Daddy for sharing your newspaper
we've all read it
and Dimitra
Dimitra can read it as well „ can she
please
there you are
are you going to eat that toast for me please Thomas
you'll be hungry later on if you don't
is that nice

which is the letter t Thomas
and that stands for Thomas „ doesn't it
the n
well there is an n in your name
ThomasHenry
Henry has an n right in the middle
and that says t as well
Thomas
n in the middle of Henry
and another t for Thomas
I think it says Scania
let me have a look
I can't see from that distance
please
yes
Scania
you got a little wooden train for your birthday that spells your name
it has some red on it
yes
the last carriage is an elephant on a red background
does that taste nice Thomas
this is very nice
I'm enjoying this
you've found a RiceKrispie so you've put it on top of a lorry
thank you
you're delivering RiceKrispies as well „ are you
his front as come off again
and what happens when his front comes off
does something
does he
where does he sleep
does he
does he
I don't think he sleeps in between the cab and the lorry
I think he sleeps inside there
oh he can't sleep in there
it's full of newspapers
or do you think he sleeps on top of all the newspapers
but that's open „ isn't it
if it started to rain and he was sleeping there he'd get wet and cold
I think he sleeps there
do you
did you have a nice night's sleep last night
in your lorry
you slept in your lorry „ did you

that's very strange because you were in your bedroom this morning
have you got a lorry in your bedroom
oh
would you like an apple now Thomas
no
would you like an apple
with big skin on it
do you think he sleeps in there
oh Dimitra Jeannine and Cathy

oh excuse me
you remembered a lot of names then
well I suppose if he hasn't got any newspapers in the back of his lorry it is large enough for people to sleep in
I'm not sure how many people

excuse me

excuse me
they can „ can't they
the back wheels can spin round and round
though I'm not sure how comfortable it'll be Thomas
if there's nothing to sleep on
just let me cut it up
please eat some more toast Thomas
come on
if you're driving big lorrys you're going to get hungry
eat some toast please
are you not
has he got
oh I see back doors
the doors side by side
I was just about to say I didn't realize it had two lotsof opening door but I see what you mean
well you're not getting any sweeties from me today Thomas
you've not eaten your toast
you shouldn't start putting food in toys Thomas
because then they get dirty
in fact you shouldn't have toys at the table at all „ should you
if you're sitting at the table it's meal time
there
how's that
is that a nice
it is „ isn't it
spinning round and round
no
they shouldn't spin round really „ should they
if the lorry driver's inside he'll get dizzy „ won't he
and fall over
oh dear
another T N T lorry run over his feet
that doesn't sound too pleasant „ does it
what did Daddy do
did he smash his head down
what do you mean
oh Thomas
that's another reason why your wheels don't work because you're always dropping it on the floor
if you didn't have it at the table and you waited until you finished your meal and you were playing with it on the floor or your little play table it wouldn't have quite so far to fall „ would it
right
I shall wrap the bread back up and put it in the bread bin
you're enjoying your apple „ aren't you
no
oh is that why you're eating it all up
I see
I think fruit is your favorite thing „ isn't it
what types of fruit do you like Thomas
apples
pears
oranges
yes
you shared an orange with Daddy last night „ didn't you
was it nice and juicy
did it have a pip in it
ohgosh
well that's it
when I give you apples I usually slice them and quarter them
like I have done just now so we can take the pips out
but with an orange sometimes if they're buried in the segment you can't tell until you've bitten into it „ can you
is that what happens last night
oh dear
and you wouldn't like that
finding a pip
do you remember those little tangerines and satsumas we had at Christmas
you were really enjoying those until you realized they had a little pip in
and you wouldn't touch them „ would you
you stopped eating them altogether
oh dear
you tried to eat an orange
you like grapes „ don't you
I can see
and what about strawberries and raspberries
oh and I tell you what will be coming up fairly soon in the Summer
cherries
pardon
Carole's tree
oh right
oh I see what you mean
that's a good boy
oh yes
Christopher's Mummy is called Carole and they have a cherry tree „ don't they
I'm not sure Grandma has one of those
my Mummy has one of those but I'm not quite sure you can eat the cherries from it Thomas
I don't know whether you can or you can't
some perhaps you can't
we'll hafta ask her the next time we see her
well I remember when we went to Swansea when you were only a baby
and Sainsburys had big tubs of cherries for ninety nine pence
and normally you'd pay about that for a quarter of cherries so we bought some
oh they were beautiful and you loved
and I seemed to spend all that holiday cutting cherries in half and taking the stone out
and you were eating them quicker than I could get the stone out
and then last year we bought cherries you enjoyed them
cherries and grapes
black grapes
yes
you like green grapes and black grapes „ don't you
a lot of the grapes we buy though are seedless
they don't have little pips in
little seeds „ do they
so you can eat them just as they are
yes
pears are like apples
they have pips
that's why Mummy normally peels a pear
cuts it in half
cuts it in half again
that's a quarter
into four quarters
yes
and the newspaper as just fallen on the road
that's the newspaper fallen out of your T N T lorry on the table
and that's how you like to eat pears but
let's have a look
I think it's just a little hook that hooks the lorry onto the cab
but when Mummy's slicing the pears
quartering the pears
I do what I do with the apples and if there are any pips I take them out
are you crunching the apple
are you enjoying that
it's a pretty skin on that apple
have you seen it
it's green and yellow and red
yellow and red but look
that's very green on the bottom there „ isn't it
and the flesh of the apple is nice and white „ isn't it
are you going to eat it
wow

you've eaten the yellow part
is it nice and refreshing
does it taste nice and crisp
sillybilly
David and Sharon say something different
you'll hafta say that again Thomas
I can't understand
I'm sorry darling
who goes in the castle
Purdie got in full of water
I don't know what you mean
Purdie's not well at the moment „ is she

poor
she needs tablets „ doesn't she
crunch
the sound of Thomas biting his apple
crunching and munching
oh don't keep saying that
Travis and Spud are saying stupid
just Travis
well Travis is one of the machines in BobtheBuilder
is Travis the tractor
and why would Travis be saying stupid
what had happened for Travis to day that
oh it's Spud saying stupid „ is it
is Spud the scarecrow
it's your place mat
it's your wipe clean place mat
it says
WaltDisney
OneHundredAndOneDalmatians
it's a dalmatian dog „ isn't it
can you see all the paw prints around the edge of the mat
so you've had a few RiceKrispies half a piece of toast and a whole apple
oh are you full now
you feel sick
you need a sweetie to cheer me up
if you feel sick the very last thing you want is a sweetie
no
Thomas if you feel sick the very last thing you want is a sweetie I promise you
Tweenie clock where will it stop
no
don't bang please
story time
there's a separate program on television called story time
in fact I think that starts next week again
I've a feeling it's on Friday next week
I think Friday's the fifth of May
AuntyMabel starts again
and story time normally follows the AuntyMabel program
Thomas don't drop it on the floor
it'll break and then you won't have a lorry to play with „ will you
well your post lorry UncleBrian hadta mend the wheels on that because you dropped it and the back wheel went funny
UncleBrian can't keep mending all your toys „ can he
has he
UncleBrian as got some funny glasses
I don't think they're funny
they're just normal glasses „ aren't they
Daddy as got nice glasses
Daddy as just bought some new glasses
what happened to his other glasses
well they were just getting a little bit old
and when you need glasses
when you wear glasses Thomas
it's because you can't see very well
and every now and again you hafta go to the Optician like AuntySal
AuntySal's an Optician
you hafta go and have your eyes tested and sometimes you can't see as well as the time before
in which case you need new glasses because you see this bit
the actual glass
that's the bit that you see through and sometimes that glass needs changing
if your eyes have changed
if you can't see quite like you did last time the Optician hasta put different glass in there to help you see better
Mummy needs some new glasses „ doesn't she
because these are getting a bit old now
I've had these since you were a baby
in fact before
you're a baby now
meow
it sounds like a baby pussycat
a kitten
Mummy useta always wear contact lenses before I had you
I didn't use to wear glasses apart from first thing in the morning and last thing at night
is it
oh the lorry's on the back of your chair and it's on top of a motorway bridge „ is it
I can't
no
I wonder where it as gone
I think it as gone under the motorway bridge now „ don't you
is it hiding
I think it might be
what is it
ah what is it
nothing
it feels like the T N T lorry cab to me
is it not
what is it
nothing
it must be something
it must be something because I can feel it
a train
what does the train say
adiddlydum
poop poop
that's not nice Tom
is it
you can hear that train
I bet if we'd been standing at BurnageStation now that train would have whizzed through really quickly „ don't you
because they don't go poop poop when they're stopping „ do they
they make that noise when they're whizzing past
it sounded very clear actually that „ didn't it
this morning
and we haven't got the window open
the bathroom's open but nothing's open down here
but it sounded very close
the wind must have blown in the right direction
that direction
yes
when I walk to the Station I sort of think of it being over there but it isn't „ is it
it must be over that way
you're pating my feet
you say paping „ don't you
but pating my feet
I'll pat yours
T N T lorry
yes
it's
you were about to say he's disappeared again „ weren't you
but he's hiding again
well I think it's time for us to disappear now
well I think it's time for us to disappear now
is that what you wanna do
oh Thomas you noisy boy
shh
it wasn't time for us to disappear „ was it
but I'm going to make this table disappear now
I'm going to tidy up
and then would you like a wash
is that all you're going to say
dingaling
shh you noisy boy

what do you say

you say no thank you
oh that's not nice

has he got a burst tyre
oh yes
he can't now
no
you're quite right
where as it gone
oh you've dropped it
well let's wash your hands and face and then you can get down and look for it
and then it's time to get dressed
cheese
why are you shouting out cheese

who as asked you to say cheese when you're having a photograph taken
cheese

holding it up to your eyes and pretending to take a photograph
you'd like your photograph taken
you'd like to take my photograph

a little mark across your nose
be careful because it's obviously cutting into you

if I'd know I was having all these photographs I would have done
what's that
a bit of scratch
is your face a little bit sore
listen
hear the train
it didn't make a poop poop noise though that one „ did it
there you are
let's dry you on the towel
ddiddlydum
oh diddlydum
little diddlydums
oh I think the other one must have been an Express because it sounded like it went very quickly „ didn't it
and it sounded like it was quite a long train
yes
if we were at the Station we would have seen that
there we are
are you dry
oh what's this on the towel
what sort of fruit can you see on the towel
plums
they're plums
