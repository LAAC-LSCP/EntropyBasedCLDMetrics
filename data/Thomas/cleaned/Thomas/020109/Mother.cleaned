no pop

when we have toast for breakfast tomorrow
mm
blue crisps
you're going to get a surprise one day Thomas
because when you say blue crisps you mean salt an vinegar crisps
because they are in a blue packet
but sometimes we buy crisps from somebody else and the crisps in the blue packet are often cheese and onion
so you're going to get a surprise one day when you ask for blue crisps
blue crisps
I think you like all crisps really „ don't you
we haven't got any blue crisps darling

the chip shop

right
Mummy's going to put the grapes in the blue bowl

yes
that's Daddy's shirt „ isn't it
Daddy's shirt
are the grapes nice
oops
there you are
is that the toy from your highchair
green rabbits skipping
I don't know what they're doing whether they are skipping or they're swinging
what are the rabbits doing Thomas
this is the ironingboard
yes
that's right
the iron's hot „ isn't it
you're not allowed to touch the iron „ are you
no
but you're in your highchair so I don't think there's really much danger of you touching
grapes all done
would you like some more grapes
no
obviously not because you're throwing the pot away
are the rabbits falling on
that's the noise the iron makes „ isn't it
whoosh
it's a steam iron
there
can you see the steam coming out of it
that's right
it looks very hot „ doesn't it
no
it's not juice
it's steam
that's right
you've got to be very careful with it „ haven't you
you don't touch the iron
very hot
it would burn „ wouldn't it
these are Thomas's trousers
your trousers
blue trousers
these are dark blue trousers
and I think you can put a light blue tshirt with them
and then your blue and red shirt on top
because it's not too warm this morning
and then if it gets warm this afternoon Grandma can just take the shirt off „ can't she
and you'll still have a nice tshirt for underneath
the rabbits
are you going to give the rabbits a name
which is the rabbit with the blue tshirt on
oh are they going away
one rabbit has a blue tshirt
and I can see another one with a red tshirt
and one has a green tshirt
yes
what's the matter
has the one with the green tshirt fallen over
it's the iron
steam iron
a blue tshirt
no
that's not Granddad
that was just a car driving past
Grandma and Granddad will be here within the hour
so not too long to wait now
and what do you think you will be doing with them today
you'll be having a sleep
well you usually do have a sleep with Granddad in the afternoon „ don't you
because Granddad has hadta get up very early to drive here so they can look after you while Mummy goes to work
so usually when you have a lie down after lunch Granddad has a little lie down as well „ doesn't he
and he has an hours sleep
the trouble is you don't have a sleep at lunchtime everyday „ do you
so some days poor Granddad won't get a rest
I think Granddad will hafta go upstairs on his own „ don't you
and have a little sleep if he needs one
I think they'll take you to the shops
all gone
have you eaten all your grapes
all the chocolate
no
you're not having any more chocolate now
what about finishing off that piece of toast
I can see one piece of toast
would you like another drink of juice

there we are
Mummy as nearly finished the ironing
yes
I've got a great big pile upstairs that needs ironing
but we've had quite a busy week „ haven't we
and I've not been around in the evenings to do the ironing this week
it was Mummy's birthday on Monday so we had a nice meal „ didn't we
and then last night Mummy was out
so tonight when I come home from work I must spend a long time ironing to catch up with all the things that have been washed
oopsadear
would you like some more juice
oopsadear
more mess
yes
a lot more mess now you've thrown that down
it's a good job the lid doesn't come off „ isn't it
otherwise you'd have juice all over the floor
and then what would happen
mm
there would be a mess
two messes
that's better you see
because you've just finished with that plate now and you've put it nicely on the table „ haven't you
there you are
boo
are you hiding and clapping your hands
what's the matter
are you clapping
what are you doing
crunching some of the cornflakes that are left in your tray
are you crunching them with your hands
cornflakes don't make a noise like RiceKrispies „ do they
RiceKrispies say snap crackle and pop when the milk goes on them
you like RiceKrispies with milk but you prefer cornflakes just to eat them on their own „ don't you
so they're nice and crunchy and crispy
mm
yes darling
yes
you'd like the box back
there you are
can you reach that
that's right
oh are you hiding those two pieces of toast in the box
and the plate
