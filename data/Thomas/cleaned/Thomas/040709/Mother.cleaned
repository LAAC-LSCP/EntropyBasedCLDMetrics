and then on your drawing board
I thought we could draw some cakes
I'm just pouring myself a cup of tea first
raining cakes
it's certainly raining alright
it's not raining cakes
but it's raining outside „ isn't it

oh you know what's playing up again
this orange light

problem with it „ don't we

because I've got that hot cup of tea now
right
now what you probably don't know Thomas
before Mummy was a student in Birmingham
who lives in Birmingham
Brum the car
Brum the little yellow car
now do you know what else is in Birmingham
the factory that makes Cadburys chocolate
and actually there's a park
we'll hafta go one day
and while Mummy was a student
one of the things that we did
Cadburys were launching a cookery book
they'd already had one cookery book
which is this one
look
Cadburys Chocolate Cook Book
and that lady Patricia Dunbar
is somebody that we useta know
useta work with
and what they did
they brought out lotsof recipes
to make all these things
that you can see in this book
and guess what the main ingredient is
chocolate
so after they brought this book out
and it sold a lot of copies
they decided they would bring another cookery book out
they probably brought out loads since
and they brought this one
Cadburys Novelty Cook Book
and this one
is signed by the lady who wrote it
for me
and what happened
look at all these things you can buy
chocolate Cadburys things
mm
no
it's not Cadburys soup
it's Cadburys drinking chocolate
it's Cadbury fingers
Thomas
mind the tea
and sit down please
sit down
otherwise you're going to fall
Cadburys finger biscuits
what are those
creme eggs
Cadburys animals
now bearing in mind this book
came out about twenty years ago
so has changed
well that's just a utensil
look
there's a whisk and scissors
and a skew
chocolate treat
that says Cadburys animals
they're biscuits Thomas covered in chocolate

it's a flake
a swiss roll yes
swish roll swiss roll
that's a flake
you know when you buy those ice creams
that have a flake in them
that's where the flake is from
chocolate finger biscuits
and they brought out this book
and I was part of a team
of people that hadta make
the recipes in this book
and then we hadta
ooh there was a huge place in Birmingham
that Mummy and Daddy went to a little while ago
when we went to the good food show
this is going back many years
and all the cakes we made were on display
and the one that's in the book
that Mummy made

chocolate buttons
they've put chocolate buttons
all on top of the cake
and on each one they've piped icing

right
this cake is an easter cake

with chicks on
oh yes
so this is a very exciting book
because everything's made with chocolaty things

and that's a big square
well it's not a square
it's an oblong cake
and it's got chocolate icing on it
seven candles
and this is coconut
that you put green food coloring in
and then there's a little toy tractor and a plough
and it looks as if the tractor is ploughing the field
and the bit he hasn't ploughed is this green bit
and what have they useta make the fence around the field
chocolate finger biscuits
and what have they stuck on top of the cake
a scarecrow
with candles
and a bunny rabbit

well actually what happened
when AuntieJanet came with Tim
I think it was Tim's birthday
came with Tim and Helen
and I went all over
trying to find a tractor small enough
to put on top of the cake
and I rang her up and said
when you come to stay with me
will you bring a very small tractor
and I didn't wanna tell her it was for the top of the cake
because I didn't wanna spoil the surprise
and I think she wondered why they were bringing a tractor
and they brought a little blue tractor
when they saw the cake
we put the tractor on top
and they thought it was really nice
no
no
no
it's many years ago
this is your new tractor „ isn't it
so have you seen how they've made
these little army tanks
covered bits of cake with chocolate
and they've put chocolate buttons for the wheels
and they've broken up flakes
and put them on there to make those
like the wheels on bulldozers
and do you know what that is
that's a dart board

the Parker Museum

this is a nice fair ground „ isn't it
what do you like going on at the fair
the big wheels
oh look at the big wheel
it's made of scissors
can you see

no
it isn't a real
candy floss
and ice creams
no
a real spinning wheel isn't made of scissors „ is it
oh look at this
this lady's sitting on a sofa
but look what it is
pair of gloves
can you see
there's a tape measure there
pliers
and crayons
that's somebody's glove „ isn't it
pencil yes
look at the cushions on the seats

that's right
they're biscuits as well „ aren't they
I've forgotten what they call those
and they've used
he is
what's he using
what's he sitting on
I don't think he's sitting on it
he's sitting on a bottle top
oh look at this
it's sposta be a barbeque
the traffic lights are made out of sweets „ aren't they
mandms „ are they
oh that's true
you don't usually get blue traffic lights „ do you
tell you what they do biscuits in lotsof things
and dominoes
and scissors
oh and I can see a polo
the polo's on the boat
pretending to be a life
what are they called those life buoys
yeah but do you know what the cone is
can you see
it's actually the tip of a pencil „ isn't it
and they've used match sticks
look

that's it
ah we're quite at the end
I think Grandad would like that book Thomas „ don't you
because Grandad will like looking at that
each picture is a scene
yes
and the scenes are all made up of different
things that you would find in your house
and you put them together to make a fascinating model
haven't you
alright love
I wanna just draw a boat
or a train or something

in a minute
right
let's put these into order please
yes
shall we trace round some of these
right
what do
which is your favorite letter
these are lower case letters from the alphabet
x
well you hafta copy it rather than draw round it
actually copy what you see
x isn't a letter that's used in many words „ is it
they're not hard darling
look an x is just like putting a kiss on the bottom of a card
now try it with your right hand
and then try it with your left hand
come on
all you do with a cross
an x is like that Thomas
there you are
try with your right hand
and then try it with your left hand
and tell me which is easiest to hold the pen in
come on
we'll only do this for a few minutes then we'll have tea
we will
come on
just try this
or would you prefer to do an a
like that
try an x
right
that's with your right hand
is it
well try just an x

try with your right hand
and try with your left hand
and tell me which you find the easiest
it's not hard Tom
no
I think sometimes when you were a baby
you useta use your left hand
for nearly everything
and since you've learnt to write
you're using your right hand
and I'm thinking one of the problem
one of the reasons you might be finding writing hard
is because you've been told
to put the pen in this hand
and I think you might find it easier
using the hand that you use
to do other things
no
don't get upset
it's alright
don't get upset
I don't want you to get upset
but I'm just saying let's just try
using both hands
and telling me which you find
the pen most comfortable in
it shouldn't hurt Thomas
writing shouldn't
it shouldn't hurt you
it shouldn't hurt
