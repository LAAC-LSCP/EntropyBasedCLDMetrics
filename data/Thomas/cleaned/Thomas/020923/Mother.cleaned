are you singing BobtheBuilder
sorry
not BobtheBuilder
row row row the boat
I don't why Mummy said BobtheBuilder then
getting confused
you're confused
you're a snake „ are you
they do
they do that with the tongue
yes
get into your chair please Thomas
well tell MisterSnake
good morning MisterSnake
please would you like to sit in this chair
it's Thomas's chair really but you're very welcome to sit in it MisterSnake
would you like to do that
right
there we are
no JellyBabys after
you won't get JellyBabys after because we haven't got any in the house
oh we've got chocolate orange
yes
well if you're a good boy
if you're a good boy
yes
if you're a good snake you can have some chocolate orange
are you a good snake
just
oh your head goes bobble
you're referring to a song that Julian taught us at music time
no
gobble
it's head goes bobble but all it says is gobble
with a
you'd like some cornflakes
the snake as got what darling
the snake as got hands
I don't think real the snakes have hands „ do they
the snake wants to play with some trains
there you are
but you must eat some breakfast
you want all the trains
the little wooden trains
oh dear dear Thomas
I'm getting a tissue because I've just sneezed
the train goes wee wee wee all the way home
oh that's like the nursery rhyme this little piggy went to market „ isn't it
let's do your fingers
that's right
wee wee wee all the way home
cornflakes
Mummy's cornflakes
I'll give a few more
would you like some milk on it
no
there you are then
would you like spoon
no thank you Thomas
that's better
I shouldn't hafta remind to say thank you „ should I
no
the engine's going round the house
it's going round your bowl of cereal „ is it
oh dear
a big train crash
why don't you just eat your cereal now darling
no Thomas
no
come on now
let's put these away
well they are on the table
but come along and eat something first
because we've got to get breakfast
no
not till after breakfast
they're all waiting now for the engine driver to eat his breakfast
there you are
I'll give you a spoon just in case you change your mind about wanting one
would you like a drink of orange or some blackcurrant juice
please
it's nice
oh sorry
snakes like blackcurrant
ah
well that's just as well „ isn't it
because I wouldn't have known what to have given a snake apart from water
I think snakes probably prefer water Thomas
however seen as it's breakfast time
you can have some blackcurrant
if you're still a snake at lunchtime we might ask Grandma to give you some water
there we are treasure
you've already had a bit of hot cross bun „ haven't you
it was left from last night
you've eaten some hot cross bum already „ haven't you
was it nice
ah you're eating like a snake as well
you're not bothering with your spoon
you're just putting your whole head in the bowl
that's not very polite „ is it
is that what snakes do
snakes put their spoons under their chairs
and then they eat like you're eating now „ do they
well if you don't want the spoon snake please put it back on the table
put it in your jungle
who's eating the spoon
the elephants
oh right
they've done what all over
lotsof water all over your spoon
oh I see
are you referring to the elephants when they spilt water out of their trunk
they go and water goes flying out „ doesn't it
have they squirted water from their trunks all over your spoon
the snake as got lotsof crunchy but what else has the snake got
the snake as got lotsof crunchy and blackcurrant juice
I see
he hasn't got water „ has he
hm
I'm quite tired again this morning Thomas
I think we're going to bed a bit too late „ aren't we
I think it's some air trapped in your beaker
keep on pressing it
there
it as gone
no
it's hissing now
it's hissing like a snake
yes
it sounds like you
it sounds like there's a rattle snake in the grass
hm
my cornflakes are nice
are yours
are you sure you don't want some milk on them snake
put the spoon on
that's a good snake
okay
I'll leave it there „ shall I
are you drinking juice as well without using your hands
you're using your teeth to pick your beaker up with
snakes don't have hands „ do they
putting them round the back of your body now
snakes are quite slippery characters Thomas
and if anybody called you a slippery character it means you're not very nice
you're a bit sly
no Thomas
now no
no
look what as happened
see the snake wouldn't be drinking blackcurrant juice from a beaker „ would he
he'd be drinking water from the ground
which is why the snake's having a job to drink his blackcurrant juice
it's not well
it's not well this blackcurrant juice because it as just landed on the floor
now drink it properly Thomas
don't
because if you drop it again and the lid comes off they'll be trouble „ won't there
that's it
what sort of snake do you think you are
you're an AuntyFrank snake
what color are you
you're a blue snake
are you blue all over or do you have a different colored tail and head
what colors
your head's green
and your body's all blue
how lovely
what about the tip of your tail
your tail's all broken today
oh dear
why's your tail broken snake
no
I don't either
you're eating snake food
oh I've never heard cornflakes described like that before
why's your tail broken Thomas
did somebody step on it
oh dear
did it hurt when it broke
lotsof big fire engines helped it
are you sure it wasn't an ambulance
oh right
right
the fireman fixed it
it's just that usually if somebody's poorly it's the ambulance that comes
and the ambulance men and the doctors and the nurses make people better
but it was a fire engine „ was it
because fire engines usually put out fires „ don't they
with hose pipes that look a little bit like snakes
I'm going to slice some bread now Thomas
to make some toast
look at this funny snake food
it's a funny shape „ isn't it
it's a loaf of whole meal bread that Mummy made
oh dear
more like a chair
it's more like something
yes
it could
actually it does
it looks like a sofa „ doesn't it
that could be the seat and that could be the back
yes
it's not quite as light as the white bread and it's a very peculiar shape „ isn't it
it looks like somebody as got the dough and just gone
plunked it in and baked it and it as set like that
now we'll cut into it
there we are
we'll cut into it and see

it's much easier to cut than white bread because the white bread's a lot softer and springy and more doughy „ isn't it
I know you like bread
yes
I like bread
I think I eat far too much of it but I eat far too much of everything really Thomas
there we are
I'll give you a piece that hasn't been cooked and I'll taste the rest
you're going to have Marmite on yours
we've not had Marmite for days „ have we
no
and we needta buy some more jam
and we haven't got any jam
we've got marmalade but not jam
oh I can't get the toaster to work
the plug as got stuck
look
can you see the electric plug
that's it
it had gone inside the toaster „ hadn't it
I thought we weren't going to get it to work then
right
I'll pop two pieces of brown bread in the toaster
and while I think about it
let's make a shopping list
I'll put it on the back of one of these raffle tickets
we didn't win „ did we
we didn't win a prize
so I'll use it as a shopping list
right
we need some jam
butter
I think we're probably alright for butter
suggest some more things
sausage roll
oh I'll write down sausage rolls and hot cross buns because we can get those „ can't we
from the baker's
yes
well the sausage roll
well
yes
the sausage roll shop is the baker's
yes
oh Thomas what else
I remember thinking the other night we need jam and we need something else
and I can't think what it was
oh we need fruit „ don't we
what sort of fruit shall we buy
and pears
alright
we'll put pears down
what else
peach
I don't think we'll get any peaches at this time of year
get some tinned peaches
you like
you like tinned peaches „ don't you
what about some bananas
and grapes
very full
and some oranges
we've got apples pears bananas grapes and oranges and I'll put in brackets peaches and then you never know
you never know whether we find some or not
you need lemonade „ do you
we've got plenty of tea
we've got plenty of coffee
we've baked bread
or I better write down milk because we always need milk „ don't we
oh fabric conditioner
that was it
you when we're doing the washing Thomas
and we pull the drawer out here
sometimes we put powder in and sometimes we put little tablets in but we always pour liquid
it's nearly always blue or white
into the slot
do you remember that
we give the washing machine a drink
well that's fabric conditioner
that makes your clothes all nice and soft
do you remember when we washed those jumpers last week
they felt lovely „ didn't they
that's fabric conditioner so I better write that down
and who else do we always needta buy food for
Purdie
Purdie food
that's right
what sort of Purdie food do we buy
Whiskas
that's right
I'll just write down Purdie food stroke Whiskas
oh now we need all sorts of other things like chicken sausages and
Daddy's on a diet at the moment so we're eating special food „ aren't we
right
I hope I'm not getting a cold Thomas
I'm sneezing alot this morning
it's no good „ is it
getting a cold
I can do without that
I was looking for the Marmite because I thought we'd decided we were having Marmite Thomas
it's here in the fridge
there we are
can you see this big brown bottle
it's a new bottle „ isn't it
yes
hold it to have a look at it while I put the margarine on the bread
and we've bought Isabel a present „ haven't we
because when we asked Isabel
oh you needn't take that off darling
no
no
we needta leave that on darling
that label
and it tells us what it is
I think we know by the shape of the jar
please open it
okay
when I asked Sonia yesterday what we could buy Isabel for her birthday on Saturday
Sonia said nothing
she as got far too many things
and Mummy said well we can't come to her birthday party and not bring anything
so we come up with the idea of a gift voucher from Boots because in Boots
you can buy clothes and you can buy toys and you can buy books
so we bought a voucher and then it's up to Isabel and her Mummy to go shopping and choose something when they're ready „ isn't it
but I think we better take a little bit of something else as well Thomas
because it doesn't feel right walking into a party „ does it
a pan
oh yes
it's a picture of a pan in front of the
well I think it's a pot in front of the Marmite jar „ isn't it
it's a pan „ is it
we can always
the envelope which Isabel's
gift voucher has come in is nice and silver „ isn't it
nice shiny silver
we could always put a bow on that and a ribbon
shall we do that
so it's not just an envelope we're giving her
and we can perhaps buy
oh something else
what can we buy
Isabel likes chocolate „ doesn't she
if we buy her a few chocolates or something like that
and we must
well we've got the present but we must buy a card
a card
a birthday card
and we'll hafta get one that says three on it because she's going to be three on Saturday „ isn't she
and we'll hafta go to her party
Daddy's at work
Daddy's not coming this time
shall we dress you up in your smart shirt and ThomasTheTankEngine waistcoat
you wore that over Christmas „ didn't you
ChristmasDay
and you've worn it to all the Christmas partys
NewYearsDay
and if you wear it to Isabel's party and then it's Charlotte's party on February
and then it'll be your party in April
I think it'll still fit you in April
is that nice
we've not eaten toast for a few days „ have we

can you not talk
no
your mouth's full „ isn't it
that made a big noise „ didn't it
it was Mummy putting things away in the fridge
I was a little bit clumsy
right
I better write on the shopping list
we've got jam apples pears bananas grapes oranges milk Purdie food sausage rolls hot cross buns peaches in brackets and fabric conditioner
and I'll put birthday card for
Isabel
that's right
when we passed her house on Tuesday
yesterday
you said lotsof fun and balloons „ didn't you
had you remembered you were going there on Saturday
have you wiped your mouth on your pajama sleeve
I thought you had
and your mouth's covered in brown Marmite „ isn't it
so what as happened to your pajama sleeve now
I do
I know
it as gone brown
it's hard to talk when you've got toast in your mouth „ isn't it
what are you looking at through the window Thomas
you don't know
you're looking at the birds
well what can you see
no dicky birds
where do you think they've all gone
I don't know either
it's snowing
I don't think it is Thomas
well I don't think so
where's it snowing
the sky's quite whitie grey but I can't see snow anywhere
where
where
I can't see snow
I think you've got white spots before your eyes
you're seeing things „ aren't you
well I can't see snow Thomas
we've not had any snow „ have we
is that toast nice
would you like a little bit more
another piece of toast
no thank you
would you like some fruit now
no thank you
you wanna get down
okay
alright
pardon
brown s not here
is that what you're saying
brown s not here
what are you telling me
what are you saying to me Thomas
you don't know
you don't know an awful lot „ do you
well you were pointing to the pajama sleeves so I assumes you were saying brown to me because you've got a brown mark where you wiped your mouth
but if you're not saying that I don't know what you are saying
you're a good snake
pardon
oh I see
you're telling me this one's not sticky
pointing out your hand
well I think you do need a little wipe Thomas
uhoh what
what's the matter
why are you saying uhoh
what as happened
not wash this hand
well I think we should Thomas
we washed this hand
let's wash this one
please
well we don't want the snake going out with a dirty hand „ do we
there we are
that's better
you'd like some chocolate orange now
well seen as you've been the best snake I've ever come across
who's cross
what about going across the road
the good snake
good road
what do you mean good road
oh Thomas if you don't know what you're talking about I've no chance „ have I
well shall we open that chocolate orange then
that's one from Christmas
in fact you've still got a lot of chocolates up there from Christmas
but you only have it when you've been good
you have eaten quite a lot this morning „ haven't you
it looks like a real orange „ doesn't it
that's right
banging it on your table
there useta be an advert that said tap and unwrap
oh look
it says it on the back of the box
tap and unwrap
just looking to see where it was made
made in York
made in York
who lives in York
what about Nana and Grandad
you wanna do it
Daddy once broke one of Mummy's best trays by taping a chocolate orange on it
it was one Christmas and we were sitting by the fire
and we were going to have some chocolate orange and Daddy took the nearest thing which was Mummy's tray
he smacked the orange down very hard on it
it didn't unwrap the orange but it broke Mummy's tray
you've not seen a chocolate orange like that before
well look inside
can you see
it does look like a proper orange „ doesn't it
look at all these segments
well that's a little hole in the middle
it might be the pip
shall we start counting
if we pop your finger on that one
we'll make that one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
twenty segments
well we're just trying to tap still „ aren't we
how about we tap it on the kitchen floor
that's quite hard
it is funny
there we are
it's not all broken up but
oh you're taking two „ are you
that's cheeky
right
that's all now
let's put it away
please may I have a piece
please may I have a piece of orange
no
I'm asking you
please may I have a piece of your chocolate orange
is it not yours
well who's is it
oh yes
there's a piece over there for me
there you are
well once we've had this we must remember to brush our teeth „ mustn't we
Isabel wasn't brushing her teeth „ was she
no
she's just refusing to do it at the moment
I don't know why
perhaps she as got a sore mouth
because sometimes when you've not been feeling very well especially when you were teething you didn't like the toothbrush going in your mouth
but what did her Mummy say to her
Isabel if you don't brush your teeth Thomas won't kiss you again
but I think she brushed them then „ didn't she
and she asked you if you brushed yours „ didn't she
Thomas do you brush your teeth she said
and what did you say
yes
I have
because you did „ didn't you
I don't think you actually said yes I have at the time
I think you just said yes
yes
I have
shh
alright
we'll eat it
well I'll eat mine when I finish my toast
you start on yours
and you should really have a piece of ordinary orange to go with that „ shouldn't you
and then you get your VitaminC and iron if you eat your chocolate and your proper orange together
is it
pardon
two numbers
well it's a pattern on the outside
it's sposta be orange rind but each segment says Terrys York
that tells us where the chocolate was made
TerrysFactory in York
hm
you can eat it
yes
does that smell nice
does that taste nice
yes
SisterEileen's coming „ isn't she
tomorrow
she's coming at night
plane
yes
I can hear it
it sounds a bit funny „ doesn't it
hm
it as gone in the clouds
we can't see it but we can hear it „ can't we
is that good Thomas
pardon
what are you talking about
you're talking things
you're talking things about doggypoos
that's not nice
not
oh no
not when we're eating Thomas
we don't wanna talk about things like that
you can talk about things
but not things like that
that's not nice „ is it
hm
it's delious „ is it
when you say delious I think you mean delicious „ don't you
do you have trouble saying delicious
oh Thomas you've put it all in at once
the whole segment
you sillybilly
hello foot
are you putting your foot up
you've nearly drunk that blackcurrant juice „ haven't you
right
have you finished now altogether
oh you're a snake again now „ are you
eating your cornflakes
you've gone back to eating cornflakes
pardon
oh eat the food up trains
you'd like to play with the trains again now
okay
have you finished all your cornflakes

I'm having a job to swallow the toast because it's quite
oh yes
I've not had my chocolate orange
I'll have that before I get down from the table
you've eaten yours
oh yes
no
because you'll only bang with it if I pass you the spoon „ won't you
yes
BobTheBuilder can bang it
let's give them another quick wipe because you've had chocolate orange since I washed you down before
what are you doing
you're wiping your mouth on my sleeve
why
oh Thomas
you're not a very nice boy at the moment „ are you
what toy darling
the wooden toy
the carousel with the teddy bears on it
no
don't say that Tom
that's not nice
no
it's not
no
no
oh you sound grumpy
you grumpy wumpy
you're Gordon „ are you

who's very cross like that
Gordon
why's Gordon very cross
Gordon's very cross because he as hadta stay in the shed
that's why
is the story you're telling about Gordon
have you seen it on television
or is it one of your ThomasTheTankEngine storys
ThomasTheTankEngine not talk
you'd like a look at this
you wanna do it
oh Thomas look at the dust on that
how embarrassing

is there not
oh good
let's just spin it round
right
watch
move your fingers
watch it go round
this is a wooden Merry go round with three wooden teddy bears on it
lotsof teddy bears
yes
there looks to be a lot when it's spinning round quickly
it was a christening present from AuntyVal and UncleStuart
and it's a wooden maypole „ isn't it
and each of the teddys has a different colored jumper
tell me what colored jumpers they have
one has
red
another yellow
do you think the blue one's a little girl because look she as got a ribbon in hair
she as got a blue top on and a yellow ribbon and the other two bears haven't
and the each have a string from the maypole „ don't they
the little girl has a yellow one
the little bear in the red jumper has
spinning round
I can't see
oh dear Thomas
I'll hafta wait for it to stop before I work out who has what
and as they dance round the maypole pulling their strings their ribbons make a beautiful pattern down the centre of the maypole „ don't they
and this is grass
look
green grass
oh well I hope not
no
so the little girl has a yellow ribbon
the bear with a red jumper has a blue ribbon and the bear with a yellow jumper has a
a red ribbon
oh did you hear that
what was it
a train
what did it say
choo choo
no
don't lift it up
that's how it gets broken
no
we've got to just spin it as it is
no
oh you can spin it certainly
yes
but don't start lifting it up because you've done that before and we got all the maypole ribbons in a terrible mess „ didn't we
what as it been from
well it's just a little toy
well it's not even a toy Thomas
really
it's just something
I suppose a mobile is the best description
it's something you can just watch
it's quite relaxing
and when you were a baby which of course you were at the time of your christening when it was bought
you useta lie in your pram or sit on Mummy's knee and watch it
you useta think it was beautiful
it's still beautiful
but when you're a baby it's a lovely thing to watch „ isn't it
spinning round
yes
but you've got to be gentle because it isn't actually a toy
it's an ornament rather than a toy
it's an ornament
it's something that you look at
because it's nice to look at
but it's not really suitable for playing with roughly „ is it
and when Mummy was at school
we useta have
I think it must have been every May
MayDay
Maythefirst
the first of May
we useta dance round the Maypole
it useta be a big white maypole that stood in the middle of the village green
and we each useta have a ribbon
and we useta skip round it
skip round the maypole
now I'm sure my head teacher useta have a piano accordion
a little bit like the keyboard we've got upstairs
but it was much smaller
and he wore a strap attached to the accordion round his back
and he held it
and he useta play
it useta make a tune
and we all useta dance round
and we hadta go under and over
and under and over with our ribbons
like this
I'm holding a ribbon
I'd go over your head and the next person I came to I'd go underneath their ribbon
and the next person I'd go over like that
and the next one under
and then when we'd finished our strings these ribbon would all be much shorter
and the maypole would have a crisscross effect
all different colors
playing the drums
yes
well there useta be all sorts of things going on there
no
be gentle with it Thomas
oh you're a Julian „ are you
you're pretending to be Julian the music teacher
so I don't know whether they still do maypole dancing
but when we get the newspaper in May quite often on the front cover it shows a picture of a little girl in a pretty dress and it says she's the MayQueen so they must still do things like that
what are we doing now
well shall we put that back
I tell you what
before we put it back let's give it a quick dust
you wanna do it
that's fine
you do it with pleasure darling
that's lovely
you're cleaning the grass „ aren't you
that's right
you
oh no
you mustn't scratch it
just wipe it gently with the yellow duster
that's lovely
oh what about the teddy with the blue tshirt
the grass behind the teddy in the red and the teddy in the yellow looks beautiful but it's a little bit dull behind the one in the blue
there we are
shall Mummy give them a little polish
let's
what shall we call this teddy
you wanna call this one Grandma
and what shall we call this teddy
this is the little girl
who can this be
oh Grandad
Grandad's a little girl teddy „ is he
well should we
this one's Thomas
well should we make the one with the ribbon in the hair Grandma
and the other one Grandad
and this one Thomas
there we are
the grass is looking shiny „ isn't it
now
because that's the other thing
like a sunshine
yes
well hopefully when it's maypole dancing day the sun shines
and the grass as probably been cut so it does look good
you'd like ThomasTheTankEngine on
I think really
that's right
you polish the wooden base
you're a good help to Mummy „ aren't you
I think it's time really we got dressed because Mummy as got to go to work
lotsof fire on board
underneath the maypole
right
you're covering it with the yellow cloth „ are you
to put the flames out
you're FiremanSam „ are you
there we are
that's one more go
isn't it pretty
I think Val bought this from a little shop near where she lives
I don't know whether you remember but we went one day to see the shop and
a little shop please
we went for a walk with AuntyVal and UncleStuart and you weren't very old
but you were walking
you were just walking
and there was a big boating lake with lotsof boats on it
and lotsof ducks
and it was a freezing cold day
it was January
it was chillywilly
chillywilly
it was freezing
it was so cold and wet and windy and horrible
and you insisted on going to look at these ducks
and we all had lots and lotsof clothes on
we were frozen
and you just marched up to this pond as if you hadn't a care in the world
and you wanted to stand and look at everything
and then to get ourselves warm we went into the gift shop and had a nice cup of tea
and AuntyVal said this where I bought Thomas's mobile from
and when we looks they had quite few other things very similar but she never does anything the same
oh you've put the duster on your head now „ have you
to store all your books nicely
you need your telephone
where is your telephone
who are you going to phone
no
well I'll get it for you and then we can decide „ can't we
you're going to phone Mummy
there we are treasure
hello Thomas
nice of you to phone me
who are you talking to on your telephone
Mummy
oh a yellow fish
yes
some yellow fish
and what's that
a horse
another horse
and a fish
what's this
this is a pink rabbit „ isn't it
and there looks to be a blue bird a pink rabbit a yellow fish and brown horse
each time we press one of the buttons it says a b c you get a different character
which one's a Thomas
the Tweeny clock
where will it stop
yes
on the telephone we've got three large buttons at the top
a red one that says a
a blue one that says b and a green one that says c
oh the green one's a little bit stuck „ isn't it
that's better
and we've got that button
and a little teddy bear pops up
and all these buttons say one two three four five six seven eight nine and zero
and that one plays a tune
but we've no batterys in it at the moment „ have we
but this one that plays the tune it's the star key „ isn't it
on the telephone
and that's the one that you said the Tweeny clock where does it stop
do you know who bought you that telephone
AuntySam
right
shall we dial Grandma's number
no
well shall we phone Daddy at work
two two four six eight four four
there you are
it's ringing
oh he as answered it

no
he as answered it
he's saying hello AlanHall
good morning
hello
you've missed him
you missed him on the telephone
I can't remember what batterys it takes Thomas
I don't know whether I've got any suitable
I'll have a quick look
I don't think we have darling
not that fits that
never mind
I'll just have a quick look in the cupboard
but we've got quite a few batterys but nothing that fits that
it's a shame „ isn't it
oh there's some batterys tape recorder but we've got to get the screwdriver to take the back off
and I don't know where the screwdriver is
let's just have a quick look
we'll use
we'll use that to take the cover off
well perhaps something we can go and
do you wanna try
no
we can't take if off darling
it says batterys
cautionq
batterys to be installed by an adult only
no
I can't get it open
we've really no batterys to put in it anyway sweetheart
so it's a bit pointless us trying „ isn't it
try again
no
we'll go to the shop Thomas
we'll find out
oh you can see a lollipop there
oh yes
I don't know
do you wanna go to the window and have a look
do you think it's lotsof parcels
they're going to Stephen's house „ aren't they
right
out your trot sweetheart
just brush these crumbs down
leave your spoon on the table please
no
because you'll only bang the window with it
Thomas no
look
he's carrying boxes in
we've not seen the green lorry for quite a while „ have we
I think we saw it one day on the motorway „ didn't we
because we said that's like the green lorry that comes to our house
or near our house
no
it's not going in your house
it's not delivering any parcels here „ is it
Stephen's
well what I think happens
it's the GrattenCatalogue van
oh look
he's carrying big sacks now
and I think what happens Thomas
people look at catalogues
and they think oh yes I like that
oh I like that
he as put them on the floor
and they order things on the telephone
and then they all arrive in this big van to Stephen's house
lots and lots and lotsof parcels and bags
and then about half an hour after this gentleman as driven away in his green lorry Stephen loads all the parcels into his car and then he delivers them round to the houses in Manchester
yes
that's one of Stephen's jobs
so this man brings them all to Stephen's house and then Stephen acts as postman and delivers them to the people that have ordered the parcels in the first place
yes
well he as just opened a little side door „ hasn't he
on the lorry
it's a very big lorry
where as it been
what's it mean
I don't know darling
got catalogues
yes
he probably has
oh look
he must have finished delivering because look
he as got his clipboard and his paperwork and he's going in the cab for a pen
so he must be going to Stephen's house now and saying to Stephen please will you sign to say that you've received all these parcels
you're PostmanPat „ are you
oh I see
you've picked up the bean bag and the cushions from the chairs
and you're pretending to be PostmanPat now „ are you
have you
another parcel
has he got lotsof pens
sticking out of his overall pocket
oh well perhaps he needs a lot pens
maybe he keeps losing them or something
or perhaps he gives them to people to sign paperwork and they keep hold of the the pen
because people do things like that Thomas
he as not closed the door to the cab „ has he
what can you see
yes
oh look
now what's he coming out with
lotsof dress
yes
they're all suit bags „ aren't they
blue and green suit bags
yes
they've probably got dress and shirts and jackets in them
we've got a catalogue „ haven't we
we've never used it though
we look at it sometimes „ don't we
yes
another parcel
has he got gloves on
well you see
perhaps a lot of the parcels and things are
oh they're all new catalogues „ aren't they
well sometimes when you're lifting heavy things
a lot of the boxes he's carrying in seem to be tied with string
they have string wrapped round them
and he's using the string as a handle
but if the parcels are heavy especially if you've got a lot of them they can dig into your fingers
but if he's wearing nice strong gloves like he seems to be wearing then it just cushions his hands „ doesn't it
protects his hands from the string cutting in
look
look
what's he doing now
oh yes
he as got his paperwork back
do you think he's going back in the van
he as shut the door Thomas
he as shut the door
he's going to be climbing back in his van in a moment
quick

look
is he getting back in the cab
bang
there goes the door
he's going where
he's going to get some sandwiches
oh I know what you're talking about
one day we saw PostmanPat
well at least you were with Grandma and Grandad
yes
and you passed PostmanPat's van „ didn't you
he was parked
and what was the Postman doing
oh he's driving off
bye bye
bye bye Gratten man
we're bound to see him again „ aren't we
I think the new catalogue as probably come out now because they have two catalogues a year
one's called Autumn and Winter
and the other one's called Spring and Summer
and I would imagine the Spring and Summer catalog's out now it's
do you think he's driving right round
or do you think he's turning round
he's not turning round
he's turning back
you're putting a card on the window ledge
lotsof cards
taxi
it's a taxi „ is it
