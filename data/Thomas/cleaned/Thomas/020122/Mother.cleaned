Mummy as picked some flowers from the grass
look at these
these are called buttercups
they're yellow
they don't really smell like the other flowers „ do they

don't be rough
my Mummy's called Daisy „ isn't she
and we've got two daisys here because
look
we can make daisy chains
just let Mummy show you
at night time when it goes dark all these petals shut up like that
the daisys go to sleep and then in the morning when the sun comes out the petals open up
Mummy's just going to make a little hole in the stalk
you're blowing them because the other day when we went for a walk we saw some dandelions
and they weren't the dandelions with the yellow leafs „ were they
they were the white
dandelion clocks
what did we do
we blew them and the petals came off
you show Mummy what you did with the dandelions
that's right
I'm making a little hole in the stalk and let's put the daisy

when you string a lot of daisys together it's called a daisy chain
are you going to put that in Dobbin's hair as well
Dobbin got flowers in his hair
oh that's lovely „ isn't it
more
we haven't got any more
we haven't got any more
shall Mummy go and get some more
well if we get some more let's fill an eggcup with some water and put the daisys in there
because otherwise they'll die „ won't they
if they're left out of the water
no we aren't going to get any more
let's just get an eggcup of water and put the daisys and the buttercup that we've picked
oh
not in the washingup now Thomas
no
I know it's water but that's water but that's not quite what Mummy had in mind
oh now here's an eggcup
let's fill it with water
right
we go back through here
yes
what's this
there we are
Mummy as got the eggcup with water now
you put the daisys very gently into the eggcup
that's right
one and
two
lovely
now go and find the buttercup that's on Dobbin's head
that's right
it's yellow
you put them in there as well
look at all these flowers
they're floating in the water „ aren't they
aren't they pretty
yeah aren't they small compared to those big lilys that Mummy as got on the mantelpiece
that's right
they're floating in the water
the stay alive longer „ don't they
wow
put it onto the water
that's right
they're very pretty flowers aren't they
six
no there's three
two daisys and one buttercup
when Grandma comes tomorrow you can show her these flowers
and you can say Grandma picked you some flowers
no
do you not think she'll like them
we're going to see my Mummy on Thursday and she is called Daisy
so you could take my Mummy some daisys „ couldn't you
no
oh dear
what a mess
we've spilt the water „ haven't we
yes we have
why do you keep saying no
where as the yellow gone
it's there
it just floated behind the daisy for a moment
can you see now how the petals are closing up
can you see how these daisy petals
yes they're pretty flowers „ aren't they
buttercups and daisys
I'm sure we know but I can't think of it
wash
that's right
we needta get the cloth out because we spilt most of the water on the floor „ haven't we
so buttercups and daisys grow on the grass „ don't they
oh a good boy
aren't you a good boy
you're bringing the hand towel to wipe the floor
you must have been here the other night when Daddy spilt that bottle of milk
you were
because he went running for the hand towel to try to clean it up so that Mummy wouldn't know
but Mummy did know didn't she
oh that's right
are you passing me the towel
that's a good boy
Bow's food oh dear
I don't think I can see any dandelions Thomas on the grass
we saw those really when were going for a walk „ didn't we
where as the gone
in the eggcup here
yellow
there we are
Mummy's just washing this beaker
can you see the flowers on this mug
they're like daisys „ aren't they
can you see the petals on the flowers
and inside in the centre there's a circle
look at the colors on this
and this Thomas
no
put that back
just have a little piece
a little piece
you can have some but just a little piece
oh look
this is your bib
you wore this at lunchtime
it has flowers growing on a garden and a picture of the sun
there are two flowers
they look like daisys
they each got yellow centres
in a way they look more like pansys because they've got two eyes and a smily mouth
but they've got petals
this one has red petals
this one has blue petals
and they have stalks and leafs
so when we're next going out for a walk Thomas we'll see if we can see some more dandelions
and you can blow them „ can't you
chocchoc
you'd like some chocchoc
no
I think you probably would
let Mummy just give you a little piece Thomas
just a little piece
you can't have all that
you can't have all that
that's right
break your piece up
good boy

that's right
more chocchoc

it's about time you had some milk „ isn't it
Mummy's just rinsing your beaker and then she's going to make a drink for you
