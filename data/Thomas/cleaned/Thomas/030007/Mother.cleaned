you might be Purdie but you can be Purdie on the back of the chair not on the window ledge Thomas

well she was just walking on the footpath and the rubbish happens to be there
do you think she's checking up where the dustbin men are
are you looking at yourself in the mirror
what can you see
can you see Mummy
and who else can you see
Thomas
you're Purdie „ are you
is it Mummy and Purdie in the window
in the mirror
has Daddy got some diet coke
good boy
did you have a little sip of Daddy's diet coke
I don't think the men are coming now „ do you
is Felix there as well as Tiddles
perhaps they stopped to have something to eat
because it is lunch time „ isn't it
do you think they've stopped to enjoy something to eat in the sunshine
and then after they've finished their sandwiches or whatever they're eating they'll come along then
let's getting eating breakfast
shall we have our lunch and then come back to the window later
yes
am I a big chicken
and you're a little chicken
okay
oh thank you Thomas
Mummy's a big large chicken
the dustbin men are here „ aren't they
well we were just about to eat something and then we saw the men coming
be careful drinking milk „ won't you
look
they've left us a new bag for next week „ haven't they
and the sun's so bright we can hardly see what they're doing
are they gathering the bags together
look
the ones down there
Tiddles what darling
Tiddles is on the footpath
oh the big footpath
the main footpath
the one near the road
you've seen the road sweeper as well „ haven't you
is that nice
it's the drainpipe
it's the clean bag for next week's rubbish and they put it round the drainpipe „ haven't they
well they hafta deliver a clean bag to every house
and sometimes they put it in the letter box
other times in the drainpipe
and sometimes it's just put in the trees
and other times it's put on the gate at the back of the house „ isn't it
but at least when it's here we can see it „ can't we
and now we'll hafta go outside pick up that bag
and put it in the bin for next week
would you like to take the empty beaker back to Daddy
you say thank you very much
who as drunk it all
a crocodile
oh you were a pussy cat a little while ago „ weren't you
crocodile's licking his tum
I think you mean you're licking your lips
you're using your tongue to lick your lips „ aren't you
I don't know
I don't know where it as got too
it's nice for the dustbin men really to walk round on a nice day like this „ isn't it
mhm
and the dustbin wagon
it's much better than when it's cold and wet and windy like last monday
was it your birthday party last Monday
cold and frosty
it was horrible „ wasn't it
it was really windy
it was miserable
we've got your friend Jake coming on Thursday
they have „ haven't they
both those ladys have been shopping
they're carrying carrier bags
what do the carrier bags say
are they each carrying a bag
I can't see Thomas without staring and peering really
I think they both said Tesco
leave the window
leave the window love
come on please
what's on fire
Daddy's on fire
you're on fire now Daddy
is he out
Daddy's going upstairs eating an apple
how can Daddy be a silly woman
for eating an apple while he's walking upstairs
well I can see Tiddles over there
look
Daddy
Daddy
Daddy
could you do us a favor please and just look out of the bedroom window and see if you can see that dustbin lorry
we can't see from down here
that's a funny thing „ isn't it
Mummy's on fire now „ is she
no
alungry bell
I think you mean an alarm bell
what do you
what do you call it
alungry bell
it's an alarm
a fire alarm
when a bell rings dingalingaling it's a fire alarm
hm
Purdie's on fire
poor Purdie
that's not nice „ is it
no
you mustn't touch that Thomas
that's a window lock
you're not to mess with the windows and the locks please
no
on the floor please
not on the wood
I think we're going to go for lunch
and if the dustbin men come we'll come back to the window
no
they could be a long time yet Thomas
we don't know where they are
we can't even hear their lorry now „ can we
well they
I'm sure they've stopped to have their lunch because it is lunchtime
we could be standing here for another hour or so and they might still not come
they're obviously busy doing something else „ aren't they
because normally when we see them round the corner they're here in a few minutes
and they were round the corner „ weren't they
they must have parked up somewhere
Tom
right
the lorry's outside
quick
this is like last Monday when we nearly missed them driving off
can you see them
they're having a job trying to get past the parked cars „ aren't they
where are they now
at Sue's house
right
don't hold the window
just hold onto me
you waving
I don't think they'll see you today Thomas because they're too far away „ aren't they
what's that sweetheart
ohgosh
I see what you mean
yes
they've been putting bags in the machine and he was putting a bottle in
do you think his hand got a little bit too close to the crushing mechanism
ohgosh
we can see the lights flashing „ can't we
we've not noticed the two on the back before „ have we
oh he's waving at you
oh that's nice
look
there we are
they've both waved
yes
yes
he as got his sunglass on and they waved at you
that's lovely „ isn't it
right
pardon
yes
yes
they wave every week Daddy
don't they Thomas
they'll probably wave again as they drive off
there's some big boxes
Sue must have been buying something new
or perhaps it isn't Sue because she as got some new neighbors
it might be the new neighbors
right
off they go
bye bye dustbin men
well
yes
Daddy was watching from upstairs
weren't you Daddy
yes
Daddy was waving upstairs
and Thomas was downstairs
oh lovely
no
not dustbin cars
no
the dustbin men don't go in dustbin cars
they go in dustbin lorrys „ don't they
look
Daddy as got back in the car and he's going now
he as got his sunroof open
well then the car doesn't get quite so hot when he's driving along
and he as had the sunroof open while the car was parked on the drive
right
he's going now
wave
there we are
did you see Daddy wave
Thomas no
right bye bye Daddy
that's Daddy gone back to work
Dad
that's right
Daddy as gone back to work so we can draw money out of the bank
that's nice „ isn't it
ah
the boy on the platform
yesterday
he said there weren't any trains running „ didn't he
well I think what he said
we went along yesterday „ didn't we
to have a look and see if there were any trains at the station
they're not running
and he didn't tell us why
he just said that on Saturday they ad been told the trains wouldn't be running along the Burnage line
I think it's UncleBrain doing some work
oh look
there's a man walking two doggys
he just said there wouldn't be any trains running along the BurnedgeLine
but then the boy also said there ad been a problem with some birds
something had happened to some birds and the RSPCA were coming
look at those doggys
but then when we walked
when we walked under the railway bridge some children had been playing on the railway line
and they ad been throwing lotsof stones down over the bridge „ hadn't they
well because they were very naughty boys
well I think he would if he ad seen them
that's very dangerous to play on the
oh well we didn't see a policeman
but railways usually do have railway police „ don't they
transport police
but you see Thomas it's very silly to play on the track
two reasons
one is that those boys playing on the track
and then what would've happened
their bellys
tummys
I don't like the word belly
I don't like that at all
yes
the train would have run them over „ wouldn't it
but the other thing is if they're throwing stones on the track
then when the train comes along it's not going to be able to work properly „ is it
and the wheels will get stuck
and then it's endangering everybody
all the passengers sitting on the train
so it's a very silly thing to do
oh
and that's the other thing we saw
we seem to see fire engines every time we go out
do you remember yesterday that fire engine
it did have it's neenas on
and it had ladders
and the men sitting in the back with their yellow helmets on ready „ weren't they
no
don't press that anymore thank you Thomas
mhm
it's always an emergency to you just so you can press the button
have you finished your lunch Thomas
are you sure
right
please don't press that again
no
it's going away now
I don't want you to press it again
have you finished your lunch
do you
right
well let's get your potty
Mummy will go and get it
you just wait there a second
no
you stay where you are Thomas
where as it gone
where's your potty
well it's not upstairs
where is it
quick
oh it's there already look
well because you like to put it there „ don't you
you like to go underneath the stairs
right
shall I leave you alone now
you want me to go and do some work in there
you like to be private „ don't you
right
you sit down
make yourself comfortable love
you got your trousers down properly
you sure
that's better „ isn't it
that's a good boy
good boy
good boy
thank you
right
shall we leave you alone
you wanna be private
yes
I'll push the sofa back
nobody can see you now
bye bye Thomas
what shall you drink
well I'm going to get you a drink of juice
right
we've got a pizza here
shall we cut it up
would you like a picnic with Mummy
you're not bothered
oh charming
that's not nice not being bothered „ is it
why are you not bothered Thomas
pardon
oh a big tractor
yes
you've not played with that for a while „ have you
two tractors
I was very impressed with you today
when we were at the station
we saw four trains and you said thousands of trains
and then you changed your mind and said four trains
and there were four trains „ weren't there
be careful
right
I think this is cool enough to eat now
you're not bothered
well you've got to eat something
come on
you do need a picnic
did you say you did need a picnic
