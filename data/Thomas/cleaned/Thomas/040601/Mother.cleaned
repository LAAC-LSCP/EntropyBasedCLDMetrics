well it won't be ready for a little while yet
fits well on that „ doesn't it
going to make some sandwiches
bet you didn't know the digger fitted on there
did you
and then what happened
after the little dog laughed
and the what
oh right
is that the trailer that squeaks
no
don't press down on it so hard Thomas
it'll break
that's a jolly squeaky wheel
isn't it
don't
does it always squeak like that
no
I know you're not
I said has it always squeaked like that
can't say I've heard it before
did it
is it good at motorbikes
no
the other grey thing's something to do with a space shuttle „ isn't it
both
both got the grey tray in this
well I suppose if it's carrying things it is a little bit like a taxi „ isn't it
even though it's a trailer it's picking things up and taking them to where they needta be
not quite the same as a taxi but nearly

actually that's a UnitedStatesOfAmerica flag that Thomas
that came with the space shuttle toy I think
what
let's have a look
oh yes
it is
yes
what
let's have a look
I can't see it
you'll hafta pass it to me

radio
it says radio on the
does it clip on there
where does the rider sit
does it actually clip onto the rider
or onto the bike
but whereabouts Thomas
which bike
this is a motorbike
oh is it
not from this set

that was one of Andrew's when he was little
so do the riders sit on the bikes Thomas
yeah he's a rider „ isn't he

I think there should be another one
there's the other bike
there's the rider
look
for that one
ooh it's nice and „ isn't it
yes
I was just thinking that I could do without that now
squeak

oh right
I think it's carrying a lot of mice
don't you
yes
that digger's nice as well „ isn't it
well you just hafta remember to turn it off when you're not playing
well there must be Thomas
there hasta be
if there's a turning on one there must be a turning off
you just slide it in the opposite direction
what do you say
what do you think it should be called
right
yes
are your hands clean
right
there you are
I'll make you a drink
in fact would you like some of that coke from last night
yes
do you know
no
keep them on please
has it
it hasn't
it's green
did it
right
you might as well drink that out of there
no
don't drink it all
would you like a little bit of cheese as well
there's a sandwich
well they're not crisps
they're hula hoops
I'll bring you some cheese and then our lunch is ready
oh now dear
I'm ready for it actually

are you
yes
I feel hungry
it's just we've had quite a busy morning „ haven't we
Thomas the toys are all over the floor
aren't they
what's a bonfire site
it better not be
you sit really on the table
well if you make a mess I'll take them off you and put them away in the cupboard
simple as that
stop it
right
I don't know whether to have some hula hoops as well
I think that'll be nice „ don't you
I don't usually have things like that
well I think we've only got red packet ones
there's come actually on their own look
this is the last packet if I have these
yes
in the bag
mhm

have you got a tickle
have you got a tickle
where do you tickle
there
that feel better
I thought it was your arm you were holding though
I thought it was your arm that tickled
hm
is that a nice sandwich
no
I know
why are they having a picnic
pardon
sunny
is that a place
no
in London
do they
hm
near the queen
do I
hm
I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing
perhaps I should wear my crown
okay
would you like one of mine
it's nice
nice to share „ isn't it
crunch

hm
tastes lovely
does yours
has it gone up your sleeve

I've had your arm tickled
it will now

a hula hoop going up your jumper
it's not really a jumper „ is it that
your top
I thought it would
this is quite a noisy lunch actually when we're eating crisps „ isn't it
and the bread's very crusty
have you noticed
hm
crackles
when you get to that bit of the sandwich if you wanna open it up and eat the bread separately so it's not quite so thick and quite so hard
the bread's fresh it's just very crusty
well the sun's shining now
would you like a picnic
well we can pretend we're outside

hm
like you'd have it the sun's out now but it might not be warm by tea time
I can see a swing really gently blowing
I can't see any of the leaves or petals and flowers moving
but
the washing on the line behind is
can you see that orange beach towel
that's blowing
just gently but blowing „ isn't it
it's in the breeze
and your swing seat's blowing
what
is Purdie blowing
blowing to sleep
hm
what are you doing
trying not to crunch your hula hoop
are you letting it dissolve in your mouth
I heard a little crunch

hm
I heard that
I can hear the birds singing as well

who
Sanjid
no
who's Sanjid
oh yes
oh
is his Mummy the lady who wears the grey coat
and she's got long hair
hm
I didn't know who his Mummy was
well probably
hm
Thomas
MrsKinser wasn't happy „ was she
I'm just ignoring you when you're rude
your rude phases last months Thomas not just a few days
well
there won't be parties if you keep being rude
oops a daisy
I nearly missed the plate then
I tipped the bag up and they all went bleugh

hm

I heard something really funny the other day Thomas
you know how sometimes you do something that's a little bit naughty
but it's not really seriously naughty
it's just something you shouldn't really do but no harm's done by it

you won't do this yet cause you can't reach but
quite often when people visit other people's house
do you know how you always wanna go upstairs
cause you always wanna see the bedrooms „ don't you
and the bathroom
so you always pretend you want a wee so you can go upstairs
well some grown ups when they get upstairs in the bathroom
they decide to have a little look in the medicine cabinet
you know the cupboard we've got in the bathroom
and I heard of somebody who knew that when his friends came round that they useta have a little peep in his cabinet
I don't know why people look in them
I don't do it
but I know people have done it here cause you can tell
cause you can hear the door shutting
and because this man knew that his friend sometimes peeped in his cabinet
when he was having a party he stuffed his cabinet full of little white ping pong balls
do you know the plastic ping pong balls
so when his friends came round and opened the cupboard what happened
all the balls fell out
and he said they were up there ages and ages
cause he could hear them cause he heard all the balls go bleugh when they all fell out


yeah
and then he said all the people were upstairs for absolutely ages
cause they were trying to put them all back and it's really hard trying to stuff a cupboard full of ping pong balls cause you can't do it with the door open
so you hafta sort of do it quick then shut the door
so that's
so that's a bit naughty cause you shouldn't really look in people's cupboards „ should you
but he knew his friends were doing this and he got them back „ didn't he
and they wouldn't be able to tell him
that they'd seen ping pong balls cause they shouldn't have been there in the first place
hm
oh he knew cause he was listening out for it
hm
and I just keep thing like powder
and soap in our cabinet but some people keep medicine in them
when medicine's in there you're sposta have it locked „ aren't you
I know
I've just done that
no
our medicine cabinet isn't locked cause I don't don't keep the medicine in the bathroom
I just keep talcum powder and soap and toothpaste and things in there
our medicines are in this big cupboard in the kitchen
and that's locked „ isn't it
pardon
hm
she's a tired old girl „ isn't she today
ah
oh she's just turned her head a little bit „ hasn't she
oops
that sounded like ping pong balls

hula hoops
look these aren't very round „ are they
I think somebody's sat on these
look at them all
you know how you should wear them as rings
you couldn't wear that as a ring
funny like a drop earring

yeah look
yours are nice and round mind
I got a a funny packet
hm
perhaps the man making these hula hoops was rushing to get home for his tea
bet he thought I can't be bothered to do rounds I'll just do bleugh

oh mine are crunchy
they're just a funny shape
they taste really nice
this sandwich is nice as well
hm

well if you put Mummy's packet in a bowl on the table at a party everybody at the party would say look at those funny hula hoops
they're not really hoops „ are they
what could we call them
this shape
hula hoops

hula hoops that have gone wrong
hula boops
what made you think of that


I wasn't planning on
no
why

bubble
what
what
the rattly train
did you hear it

what itches now
what itches now
are you enjoying your lunch
hm
I was really ready for this today
hungry Mummy
yes
what
hm
I think it was a mistake
when I picked my sandwich up there was a hula hoop stuck to it
sorry
hula boop
cause mine are the ones that have gone wrong
a pulaboop
boo boo
well I'm not going to the railway station till I've had my lunch
well do you know how to get to the station on your own
where would you go
you'd get a taxi there
oh Thomas
that's lazy
it's only round the corner
quarter of an hour walk at the very most
well perhaps a little bit longer
we usually allow half an hour when we're going „ don't we
cause it takes us about twenty minutes by the time we've looked at everything and bought our ticket
I'll tell you what
thank you darling
I'll tell you what we'll hafta do one day
the train is from the station up here
I don't know about EastDidsbury station but the Burnage station the trains go to Windermere
I would imagine it would stop at EastDidsbury
you know where Windermere is „ don't you
the LakeDistrict
do you remember a while ago we went with Daddy on that paddle steamer and it was really windy
because you didn't wanna go at first
and when the wind was blowing so much we were giggling cause we couldn't breathe „ could we
it was so rough
do you remember
hm
water was going everywhere
it was really funny that weekend
hm
it was a lovely day „ wasn't it
cause actually the weather was beautiful and warm and sunny
no you didn't
and you went for that little walk with Daddy
do you remember
left me in the car
and what happened to Mummy's sandwich
a seagull pinched my sandwich
no
it didn't Daddy
we were all sitting „ weren't we
just having our
was that oh that wasn't in the LakeDistrict
that was in Wales „ wasn't it
I can't think which part of Wales
but
hm
the seaside but I don't know which part
I think it was Conwy or something like that

I was enjoying my sandwich
you and Daddy had eaten quicker than me and you'd eaten yours
and I had just a little bit left and that seagull just came along and swooped
and took it out of my hand „ didn't he
it really frightened me
actually he scratched my hand as he flew off and that hurt for a long time afterwards
were you quite shocked
cause when he swooped off with my sandwich he flew right above your head „ didn't he
hm
I think he'd been watching me for a long time and he must have thought I'm going to have the sandwich from that woman
no
perhaps he said that when he was looking at a distance
then he would realize that it was Mummy as he got nearer
and the oh we all went back to the car to finish off
well Mummy and Daddy had coffee and I don't know what you had
so that the seagull couldn't get us
cheese and ham sandwich you had „ didn't you
and I had prawn
so did the seagull

what do you think Daddy had
slugs
no
it was a prawn sandwich
though Daddy doesn't like prawns really „ does he
fussy Daddy
and fussy Thomas
it's all right
it'll wipe up in a minute
no
we'll get a cloth before it goes on your sleeve
there a broken hula hoop as well on the floor here
I think I dropped this one
and there's half of one under your chair which you must have thrown

excuse me
pardon
there's a little bit of what
get it
get it
get it
yes
now come on
sit up or you're going to knock a whole drink over Thomas


there'd be trouble then „ wouldn't there
right
are you going to finish your sandwich and then we can think about having something else
would you like something else
no
are you full up
thank you
very nice
oh no
no
because what you'll do you'll leave that half a sandwich
and then about ten minutes after you've got down from the table you'll say oh can I have a drink and an apple I'm hungry
would you like an apple now
pardon
pardon
no what
thank you
what about finishing Joshua's birthday cake
since when
no
cause you've left your sandwich
it's green icing
but was it a racing car
no
because you've not eaten your sandwich
can't have pudding if you don't eat your main course
hm
was it a nice birthday party
it was very hot actually
you looked very sweaty when you were racing round
were you
hm
no
it's all gone now
it was only a very tiny piece „ wasn't it
well when you have a birthday cake by the time you've cut it up give a piece to everybody who was at the party
and people like Mummies and Daddies and Grandma and Grandad have a piece there isn't a lot left so the only way to make sure everybody has a piece is to give everybody a little piece
but it was very pleasant
very nice
oh I think he did
he can't have had all of it because we've just had a little piece „ haven't we
so do you really not want that sandwich
I'll pop it in a box for later
okay
is that all you can say
hm
no
pop it in there please because
well it's left from last night
and once the beaker it's in gets very soggy it starts to leak
that's why I've popped it in another beaker
do you think Sarah had a nice time at her party yesterday
hm
that's a leaf out of the flowers
actually I could do with throwing those flowers out
they're dead
might keep the blue ones cause they're pretty „ aren't they
oh the thistles
the thistles are dead really „ aren't they
they're not particularly pricky any more
prickly I should say
not tickly
no
prickly
if they were very fresh I wouldn't be able to just touch them like I have done without going owq
do you wanna feel them all
be careful
just touch the blue flower at the top
right
do you think you touch that just careful
that's right
now feel the leaves
yeah
they are spiky still „ aren't they
but not as sharp as when they were very fresh
yes
the stalks had lilies on them
you know like the orange lilies that are there
but eventually the petals die and they fall off and that's what you're left with
just a little stalk
in fact when you've eaten that sandwich you can help me do those flowers
Thomas
no
put it in a box
please sit back
well we need
no
sit down
and Mum
when you've finished this
have you finished that
you'll hafta be a bit careful playing with them because you might start itching properly
cause some of the leaves shouldn't really be touched
sit down darling
right
is that
no
you're not
is that finished with now
properly
so I'll just get a cloth and wipe the table
and you mustn't get those wet because those are Daddy's papers „ aren't they
no now
I'll get a vase and I'll put some water in it and then we can take the blue flowers out and put them straight into the vase
yes
not the prickly ones
there's no point in keeping dead thistles „ is there
sit down Thomas
you're going to end up knocking them over
where's
sit back down or you're not doing it
no
in a minute
you're going to end up knocking the whole vase over
do as you're told
a drink of water
are you
what are you fishing for
fishing for what
hm
right
I'll just get a piece of kitchen paper kitchen roll
right
would you like to take those blue ones out and just lie them on the paper please
the stalks are all horrible now
can you see
more blues
oh actually we could have these leaves as well cause those leaves are still fresh „ aren't they
oh I don't know though
no
they're dropping a bit „ aren't they

those feel a bit crispy „ don't they
all right
some more blue flowers there
these are pretty sort of daisies but they've had it
no actually Thomas they look like miniature sunflowers „ don't they

sunflowers grow to be very large „ don't they
but these are only tiny flowers
can you see all the thistles together now
ow
actually that did prick
hm
well no
I don't think it's good for you to prick yourself on a thistle
well you do that then
sit down though
there you go
pass out the scissors
right
cut them
let me show you
above the gungy bit
but not too near the flowers cause they've got to stand in water
now you hafta give your hands a good wash when you've finished
that's it
shall I put them in the vase or would you like to put them in the vase
right
okay
no
lower down Thomas
come on
just above the gungy bit
no
which hand do you use to use scissors
that's it
they won't last much longer but it's a shame to put them in the bin when they could last a few days
no
right
no Thomas
that's a good boy
isn't it a pretty color this
if you'd like to
right
no
because you'll just get it on the floor
snip this please
you love getting things on the carpet „ don't you
messpot
oh Thomas
much lower down
they're too short to go in the vase
right
that one
right down there
no
what do you think about the thistles
I think we should just throw the thistles away „ don't you
no
it was too low down that
they probably won't go in the vase anyway Thomas

we'll hafta
but we'll have probably some of those leaves
that would be all right
could you cut this down a little bit for me
cut it there please
that's wonderful
thank you
no
don't cut anything else now
nothing else is worth saving „ is it
just cut it straight onto there
are you
what about the leaves
do you think we should take some of the leaves

would you like to cut that there
no
no look no
there's no point there
it's too short to go in the vase
thank you
right
that'll just fork it out cause the leaves look all right there then
there you are
some more here
snip
no
there
no
there
on that one
no
this one
that's it
this smells of minty
sort of eucalyptus you know when you've got a cold and we get something to put on your handkerchief to let you breathe better
no Thomas no
I don't know

right
well we'll just snip a few more leaves then

cause the vase is going to fall over

thank you

right
thank you
thank you for your help
right
are you going to come and get your hands washed please
in a few minutes I can
yes
I wanna just put these few bits and pieces outside in the bin
I think that would be a good idea
right
yes
there are scissors in there
right
just use a little drop of soap sweetheart
please
that's it
a good rub
and you can rinse them
and somewhere there should be a towel
here we are
that's fine
can you rinse them very well for me
that's a good boy
don't those look pretty
don't they
pardon
oh we're not going outside yet
it's nice outside „ isn't it

no
stay there please
right
we needta get these bits of dead flowers
right
while you're down there could you pick up the things there and put them in that bag please

you show me which toy you think it's from
oh no
no it isn't Thomas
it's not
no
it's not from there
it's just for something now
those have been in a bag for ages
that hasn't moved
it must have something to do with the equipment somewhere
right
we'll leave it there and then we'll have a good look afterwards
right
thank you very much for helping and for picking those things up
yes love
did you
I know
it does „ doesn't it
I don't know why
haven't a clue what makes it go funny
is it
don't touch any of the wires please
is it
are both the orange and the green ones on
they're all on „ are they
which red one
that's orange
that's
oh right
did it
right
did it do a little blink
the green flashed
oh no
the green one doesn't flash
the green one stays on all the time
if the orange one flickers on and off it usually means
that the microphone isn't working properly for some reason
and then the microphones
yes
that one oh
it's funny „ isn't it
that one
and these
should always be green and if a red light comes on it means the battery's flat so we hafta keep an eye on those „ don't we
seem quite funny when we haven't got this equipment any more „ won't it
when we don't hafta talk for Jeannine and her friends
don't go behind the bed love
well I think you'd turn around a lot better if you came out
no
Thomas out of there please
come on
out
you're not to go there
come on
think you need some oil for your squeak
you need a drop of oil for the squeak
your traffic lights are a little bit like the lights on the equipment
green red and amber
well if you put oil in things it lubricates them
if things usually squeak when they're sticking or catching
and if you put oil on it just means things move a bit freer
so they don't clatter and clang quite as much
cause oil's very slippy „ isn't it
it's greasy
I'll hafta have a caution oil on carpet sign
won't we
big sun
what's that
your orange balloon

yuck

it's better if you can put toys in it
especially seeing as you now just had some five pence pieces
right
