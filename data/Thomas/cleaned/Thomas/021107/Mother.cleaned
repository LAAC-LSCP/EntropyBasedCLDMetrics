when we go to Didsbury on Friday mornings we see the dustbin men „ don't we
real ones
yes
well they're real ones that come here as well
but it's a red dustbin lorry that goes to Didsbury „ isn't it
and they seem to have wheelie bins „ don't they
whereas we still have bags here
but we got quite a surprise „ didn't we
because Julian who we thought was poorly
rang up this morning at about half past eight to say he was better
and that it was bangadrumtime
he said I know this is short notice but if you're free I might be able to do it this morning
so we got ready and rushed down to Didsbury „ didn't we
was it nice to see him again
no
they're not Quavers these love
they're crisps
crisps and
I don't know what you mean darling
something to do
something to do with AuntieMabel
so it was a real surprise going to bangadrumtime „ wasn't it
and your old friends were still there „ weren't they
no
no
Isabelle wasn't there
but the thing is Isabelle hasn't gone to the same class for quite a long time now „ has she
she goes to the later class
we go to the earlier one in the morning
pardon
crisps are
I don't know what you're saying
sounds like you're saying crispq and thinq
are you thinking about perhaps when AuntieMabel as visited the crisp making factory
and they're slicing the potatoes very thinly
is
is that what perhaps you're thinking of
is that what she says
something that sounds like crisps and thin
potatoes „ isn't it
that are sliced very thinly
and then the crisps are dropped into very hot oil „ aren't they
mashed potato
you don't really like mashed potato „ do you
you ate those fish cakes the other day though Thomas
and they're made of fish and mashed potato
who is it that likes mashed potato
is it BobtheBuilder
Bodger and Badger
I'm sorry
of course it is
silly me
I was getting mixed up then
oops a daisy
that was a big bang „ wasn't it
I just opened the fridge door
but it caught the stainless steel worktop and made a big bang „ didn't it
would you like a little bit of cheese
what
what about some coleslaw
and some coleslaw
right
well that makes a nice quick lunch „ doesn't it
bread cheese coleslaw crisps
and then we can have one of the pears that we bought the other day
would you like a pear
course I like pears
is that what you said
pardon
oh yes
Tesco
the coleslaw's from Tesco
you're quite right
well you will have in a second
silly you
well it was silly Mummy really „ wasn't it
for not bringing you one when she gave you the coleslaw
there you are
right
we'll leave the pears until later on „ shall we
right
now I'll get something for myself
am I allowed a packet of crisps as well Thomas
can I have the blue ones
oh I think you like the blue ones „ don't you
pardon
yes
I'll have a red one
I'll save the blue ones for you
the blue ones are salt and vinegar „ aren't they
we've got to go back to the shops later this afternoon
we need some things „ don't we
in fact I'm going to make a list now while I think about it Thomas
I think we could do with some coffee
and some more milk
and some more cheese by the looks of it
because look
there's some cheese in that pot
there's a little bit of cheese in this dish
and then that's it
no more cheese
and bread
we usually make our bread
but I think we'll buy some today
what about some big sausages
would you like some sausages
we've got some sausages in the freezer
you are a clever boy
yes
well I must remember to get those out and defrost them
oh we need some peas „ don't we
some frozen peas
and mashed potato
no
well we've got potatoes in the fridge
so if we needta do some mashed potato Mummy can make that
pardon
you can help me
of course you can
coffee milk peas bread cheese
we'll need some
you'll help what for me
you'll help with the knife
well right if we're making mashed potato we needta peel the potatoes
we've got to take the skin off
and then we've got to
well that's a baked potato
we put it in the oven to bake „ don't we
mashed potatoes we needta cut the potatoes up into smaller chunks
and wash them
and carrots
and then we put them in a pan of water „ don't we
and when they're cooked we tip out the water and put some butter and some milk
and we mash with the potato masher
make it nice and shiny and then it's ready to eat
make it nice and smooth
we don't want any lumps in it „ do we
and the carrots we peel the carrots
and slice those
and put those in a pan of boiling water and put the lid on tight
and cook those
right
now I'm also writing down kitchen paper and cream cleanser
some more powder
no
I think we're alright for powder
and I'll just check the situation of Purdie's food
because we often need food for Purdie „ don't we
ah
what about lemonade
well we haven't got any lemonade
but the thing is I can't carry very much Thomas when I've got you
and I think by the time we've carried all these things there won't be room for lemonade
we'll ask Daddy to pick some up on his way home from work
from Tesco
well we're going to Tesco I think
em Cornflakes
that's what we need
don't we
and shall I write down hot cross buns
sausage rolls
well we've got some sausage rolls in the fridge as well
Mummy needs to take some money out of the cash machine „ doesn't she
well no
I think you'll just watch
it's not really very helpful if your press buttons at the bank
you can watch me
certainly
that would be nice „ wouldn't it
have Thomas watching me
would you like a drink with that darling
no thank you
you're alright „ are you
no
I haven't got a drink
I'm just going to have water today
would you just like some water
there you are
well yes
certainly
when you were a baby you useta drink
well you still drink milk
yes
you're useta drinking some milk
you useta drink a lot of water
you were a good boy
all you friends were drinking juice and you were quite happy with water
and when we tried you with juice
that's right
we tried you with juice and that was it you liked juice
want some more coleslaw in your bowl darling
because you've eaten that „ haven't you
does that taste nice
lovely cement
cheers

oh steady
right
I've got my water
look
Purdie's here again now
Purdie drinks water „ doesn't she
put in the water
hello pussy cat
oh Thomas
that's not a nice noise „ is it
I think I shall make a sandwich
no Thomas
don't do that or I shall take it off you
if you gulp in a lot of air your tummy will ache
won't it
do you think your pussy cat wants to go out
I think she wants something
she's hanging around
oh look
she hasn't got any plates on the floor
Thomas now steady
just drink it slowly
just little sips
small sips and don't rush it
how's that
well you've had a drink now
eat a little bit more lunch and I'll get you some water
well I'll get some more in a minute
because otherwise you're going to fill up on water and you won't have had anything to eat
and then later on you'll be very hungry
so I'll finish making this sandwich
and then I'll feed Purdie
and then we'll see about some more water
how does that sound
pardon
feed Thomas
I am feeding Thomas
yes
don't forget to eat some cheese please
right puss
get cracking
you said that yesterday „ didn't you
that really made me laugh Thomas
come on Purdie
let's get cracking with your lunch
it's a very funny thing to say Thomas
oh I think we needta write baked beans down
on our list
oh hello puss
yes
you've got some ice cream in the freezer
I haven't got any ice lollies
oh sorry puss
well no
we're only going to get a few bits and pieces from the supermarket Thomas
we can't carry a lot
can we
is there a lorry outside
where
I thought you were saying look at that lorry again
oh has the lorry driven away
I didn't see it
and I didn't hear it either
what was it like
like a black sausage
oh
was there really a lorry there
whose house
near JakeJimmy's house
Thomas we live nowhere near JakeJimmy's house
so you must have very good eyesight
or else you're talking about something I can't relate to
well that silly Daddy got very cross with you „ didn't he
for saying silly woman
that's something on your FiremanSam video „ isn't it
and it's not very pleasant „ is it
it's a very naughty thing to say Thomas
would you like some more coleslaw
what do you say
yes please
now eat some cheese as well
won't you
who's having a big huge sniff
FiremanSam
that's not pleasant „ is it
especially at lunchtime
I don't know Thomas Lastname
what are we going to do with you
put you in the oven and bake you
okay

we'll never see you again if we do that
you'd never see Mummy again either „ would you
I'm just writing baked beans down on the shopping list now Thomas
we've got plenty of fruit „ haven't we
we don't needta buy fruit today
we're crunching crisps „ aren't we

what are you pretending to be
some sort of machine
you're a silly machine
you certainly do silly things Thomas
your hair looks nice today
you look more like JakeJimmy
well JakeJimmy's very blonde „ isn't he
he's a lot fairer than you
and in fact he's moving house „ isn't he
JakeJimmy's moving away
JakeJimmy's moving to Macclesfield
which is where Bethany and Jill live
so perhaps we could tell Jill and Bethany that JakeJimmy's moving there
because then she knows Macclesfield
she could make JakeJimmy feel welcome „ couldn't she
mhm
guess what Purdie's doing
don't say anything to frighten her
what's she doing
she's not eating her dinner
what's she drinking
she's drinking water from her water bowl
that's very strange „ isn't it
that you should have water
I'm having water
Purdie as had a really long drink
she must be thirsty
no
she as still got plenty left in the bowl
Purdie don't do that
oy

that's naughty
she's sharpening her claws on the edge of the sofa
we've got a proper scratcher for her upstairs „ haven't we
by gum
if it's not one of you it's the other one in trouble
you're having fish and chips
at whose house
oh at Pippin's house
do AuntieMabel and Pippin have fish and chips
I see
I bet you can't eat a piece of cheese
can't you
I bet I could
you're making a lot of noise eating that coleslaw
pardon
oh it's a cake baking
I see
right
I see
you're twirling the coleslaw round with your spoon and pretending to mix a cake „ are you
oh dear
sounds like a poorly cough Thomas
that's a poorly cough „ isn't it

what a poorly cough
it was nice this morning
because at bangadrumtime
we still call it bangadrumtime
it's music time „ isn't it
instead of banging the drum what did Julian have for you to bang
well what was the thing that he showed us what to do
and then he
well can you not remember
and then he carried it round the room and let everybody have a go
what was it called
a cymbal
that's right
he had a big shiny cymbal „ didn't he
and he said you can either bang it very quietly
or very loudly
or somewhere inbetween
and he showed you the sound it made if you hit it at the edge
and the sound it made if you hit it in the middle
and he showed you how to stop it ringing „ didn't he
can you remember
you did
you did bang it loud
yes
everybody laughed „ didn't they
because you went round the room
there were about seven children in the room I would say
perhaps more
let's think who there was
there was Aaron
there was Aaron „ wasn't there
and then there was Alex
a little girl
then there was the lady with the three children
Ruth Katie was new today
was it Robert or James
I don't know who she had today
I think it was James „ wasn't it
you think it was Robert
I'm really not sure
that's five children
and then
there was Georgia
sitting next to you
there was you Thomas
and then the next person along was Oliver
oh Eleana was there
that's nine children
gosh
we've got a lot of people
nine children
and he went round the room „ didn't he
and he said now hit hit
and most children just hit it
alright
well are you going to eat all that Thomas
no more for Mummy
you're going to eat it all up
most of the children just banged it „ didn't they
and you banged it very loudly
all the other children banged it quietly
and Julian hadta encourage them to bang it loudly „ didn't he
he said come on
you can do better than that
and you just picked up the gong and went bang
everybody laughed „ didn't they
and then he said very good Thomas
and now try and do it quietly
and you did „ didn't you
you did manage to do it quietly
and then what did that lady say
well I said to her trust Thomas to be noisy
and she said are you a noisy boy
she didn't believe you were a noisy boy „ did she
well there is some more coleslaw for me because we're sharing Thomas
you've had an awful lot of coleslaw
I think you should have eaten some cheese
no more for Daddy
well we have another tub in the fridge
and we'll have a look at that and see if it's full
if it's not we'll buy another one when we go to the supermarket
no more bread
would you like a bite of my sandwich
it won't make you sick
I've got a cheese and coleslaw sandwich
it's very nice
no
and we did the hippity hop song „ didn't we
hippity hop down to the shop
a moving shop
and we did some running and jumping about „ didn't we
and then we always have a piece of classical music at the end „ don't we
right
thank you
that's right
we lie down together „ don't we
and have a little cuddle
and then we just listen to music
nobody walks around
nobody talks „ do they
we just lie quietly and listen
and then at the end everybody sits up
the children sit up
everybody sits up at the end „ don't they
oh
I don't think anyone said stop everyone this is the fire service
I don't think that happened darling
what's happening at Bella's cafe
hey quiet
Purdie as got a tummy
she as got a lovely tummy „ hasn't she
I can't tell what you're saying Thomas because you've got a mouthful of food
it's rude to talk with your mouth full

you're looking at FiremanSam through the window
well I'm looking through the same window and I can't see FiremanSam
I'm looking through the glass on the patio door and I still can't see FiremanSam
I can't see him through the front window and I can't see him through the back
who can you see
still can't tell with a mouthful of bread roll
would you like a bite of this

I don't think Purdie can wipe you

and shall we wipe that little mouth
hm
you like having your face wiped „ don't you
I don't know why
one more wipe

is that why you like having it done
right
I'll just rinse the cloth and wipe you again
make sure we've got rid of all the soap

soap doesn't go in your tummy
that would make you sick if soap went in your tummy
I think we needta get a clean towel as well from the drawer
there we are

there's some red apples
the snakes and the beans
they're blackcurrants
there are cherries lemons
these are little
I'm not sure whether they're called blackcurrants or blackberries

new to you
it belonged to somebody else „ didn't it
well we bought that in the CancerResearchCharityShop today „ didn't we
pardon
I can't tell what you're saying
it makes a lot of noise „ doesn't it
what it is
we saw in the window this superb little tractor and train and we thought that's what it was
it has a sheep in the back
and we thought perhaps you took the sheep in and out
and when we got home we discovered that if you pull the sheep like you're doing now
just pull it
if you pull it down and let go it climbs into the trailer on it's own the back of the trailer shuts and then the farmer drives of „ doesn't he
it's very exciting because we didn't know it did all those things when we bought it „ did we
just be careful it doesn't go on the floor Thomas
because it might break
you're better to do it on the floor than the table
off it goes
has he had a crash
he as not fallen on the floor though „ has he
he's just wedged near the table
there we are
oops
don't touch that
crash
he keeps crashing „ doesn't he
goodness me
oh it's not mine „ is it
it's yours
well it did belong to another little boy „ didn't it
or perhaps a little girl
it belonged to another child
mhm
a little girl something like that

oh
you think it might have belonged to a boy called Matthew
it might very well
Matthew
what do you say
the only thing is it's like all toys
it as crashed
it makes far too much noise „ doesn't it
why you can't do it quietly I don't know
noisy tractor
in a field
tractor in a field
it keeps crashing
what do you say
this is why you're better on the floor
because if it's on the floor it can't fall down
and then when it gets stuck you can just get it
has it crashed again
it's always crashing „ isn't it
always crashing
the man's pulling it away
who's having a ride
the lamb
having a ride in the back of the tractor
the driver doesn't come out „ does he
it's just the sheep
it's a baby sheep
did you say it was a baalamb

it's a field
it's a field full of grass for the tractor
and the trailer coming along

read and listen and do the actions too
so shall we have a look and see what's in inside
there might be some of these that we know already

incey wincey spider
yes
out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
IncyWincy spider climbed up the spout again
two little dicky birds
you know this one
in fact we did it with Julian this morning
two little dickie birds
oh well we sang PostmanPat with Julian
are you going to sing that
this tractor lives up this hill „ does he
well I think that's a lovely book
we're going to have a lot of fun with that
once we've learnt the actions
yes
I like the
looking at the sheep in the tractor the nursery rhyme they sang on the Tweenies
baa baa black sheep have you any wool
yes yes sir
three bags full
one for the master and one for the cat
and one for me to knit a woolly hat

that's a silly song „ isn't it
because sheep like this one have woolly coats
and when the coats come off their back it goes through all sorts of processes of being cleaned and being combed and being spun
until it's wool
and when it's in the shape of the balls of wool people knit with it and make it into jumpers like the one you're wearing today
so that's what sheep are
little woolly jumpers walking round on legs
lotsof rhymes about animals „ aren't there
oh look there's lotsof these
there's three in a row that we do with Julian
five little peas in a pea pod press
one grew
two grew and so did all the rest
you're doing the actions
they grew and grew and did not stop
until one day the pod went
right
you know this one
let's say it again
five little peas in a pea pod press
one grew
two grew and so did
all the rest
they grew and
and did not stop
until one day
the pod went pop
and we know this one as well from Julian
cobbler mend my shoe
get it done by half past two
because my toe is peeping through
cobbler mend my shoe
and we
this is the last one now
but there's a lot more in the book but we won't do anymore now
this is one we definitely know from Julian
what do you suppose
a bee sat on my nose
then what do you think
he gave me a wink
and said I beg your pardon
I thought you were the garden
then what happens
buzz buzz buzz onto Mummy's nose
and them Mummy says ohq
what do you suppose
a bee sat on my nose
then what do you think
he gave me a wink
and said I beg your pardon
I thought you were
the garden
