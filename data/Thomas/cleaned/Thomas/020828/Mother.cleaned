oh are you shouting BobtheBuilder
have you strapped yourself in
you've strapped yourself in
let's have a little look
oh that's clever „ isn't it
oops a daisy
oh I think you've put it round your leg when it should have gone round your tummy
right
shall we have another go
you've been very clever though trying „ haven't you
it's round your tummy
that's right
there you are
you're in your digger „ are you
you're in your breakfast digger
well it is breakfast time „ isn't it
would you like Cornflakes or cereal
I mean or RiceKrispies

I've asked a silly question and you've giving me a silly answer
would you like Cornflakes or RiceKrispies
you want
does that mean you want some jam sandwiches made into shapes
are you not bothered about cereal this morning
alright
you're not bothered
right
well I'll make some sandwiches then
I'm going to make some sandwiches
that's right
into shapes
where's your hat
the BobtheBuilder hat
well just a second
I'll get it for you
yes
you need it if you're driving the digger „ don't you
do you know what date it is today Thomas
it's NewYearsEve
NewYearsEve
it's the last day of nineteen ninety nine
it's Friday the thirty first of December
nineteen ninety nine
nineteen ninety nine
and in the morning when you wake up it's going to be not only Saturday the first of January
it's snowing
well it might be snowing
it's going to be the very first day of the year two thousand
the millenium
millenium
that's a thousand years
so today when you see people you've got to say
you know how you've been wishing everybody merry Christmas
you've got to start saying happy new year
Purdie's climbing out the window
are you going to wish Purdie a happy new year as she comes in now
that's nice
oh you giving her a kiss as well
she's saying happy new year back Thomas
and thank you
you read that in Macdonalds
oh what did you read in Macdonalds
that it was the year two thousand
did you
oh
Purdie's birthday
it's here
well here's your helmet
oh don't say that
big doggy poo's in the digger place
that's not nice
oh you've put your hat in there „ have you
I was just looking to see if I could find the rest of the bricks with that whatever it is you got in Macdonalds the other day
when we went over to York we stopped „ didn't we
I'm not quite sure how it's made
it's a bit
well it looks like a wall now
it looks a bit like a toucan „ doesn't it
I don't think that's quite how it went because we've lost one
we haven't lost one of the red bricks
I just don't know where it is this morning
trouble is Thomas you've got such a lot of lego and things for Christmas that I'm not quite sure which lego bricks belong to which set
because we've got it all in just the one crate „ haven't we
can you see the eye looking at you
it as got two eyes
an eye on this side
oh sorry
I should put the stand like that „ shouldn't I
or shall we make that it's head

do you know what it looks like Thomas
it looks like the cockerel on the KellogsCornflake packet „ doesn't it
that bit looks like the cockerel „ doesn't it
the red bit at the top
all fall down
crash
you're building ThomasTheTankEngine „ are you
well I've only brought a very few bricks to the table because I think those bricks only make a cockerel or a toucan „ don't they
red sandwiches
that's what I'm going to make you now
and shall we cut them into fancy shapes like we did the other day
would you like some cheese with this
two
one ears
two ears
would you like some cheese with this
just jam
okay
well you can smell it in a minute when I'm done
we've got to go out today and see if we can buy some milk
and then this evening there could be lotsof fireworks going off Thomas
so if there are any fireworks early in the evening shall we go for a walk
see if we can see any
we'll hafta see how tired you are
as to whether you can stay up or not
because at midnight BigBen that big tall clock in London that you see on the news when it chimes midnight when it reaches twelve and when the church clock here strikes twelve it'll be happy new year time
I think during the day we'll be able to see some pictures on the television because one or two places such as Australia will be saying happy new year to each other a long time before we will
perhaps at lunchtime today
so we can have a look at the television and see if they're letting off fireworks or doing anything special „ can't we
so on our Christmas cards we were wishing people happy Christmas and a happy new year
and tomorrow it will be the first of January
the day after the second of January
and the day after that Thomas is two and nine months
two and three quarters
just a second
so at the moment when people ask you how you are you always say two and a half „ don't you
you've got to start saying two and three quarters
can you say that
two and three quarters
now are those sandwiches alright for you
would you like a drink sweetheart
no
some blackcurrant juice
what do you say
good boy
yes
a snowman
that's a nice shape „ isn't it
I think we'll finish our breakfast with an apple today because you've not been eating „ have you
well you've had some little satsumas and grapes but you've not really been bothered about apples „ have you
are those sandwiches nice
I know you said you didn't want cheese but I'm going to just cut a little piece Thomas
and if you change your mind you've got it „ haven't you
I think Mummy needs to clean the fridge out today „ don't you
it's a real mess
we've got food left from Christmas and all sorts of things in there
I'm not really sure what we do have
we'll go for a walk today after we've been to the shop to buy some milk we'll have a little walk „ shall we
there you are
a merry Christmas tree
oh I've not put the lights on ours this morning
we'll do that in a minute
this time next week the tree will have gone
we've got to take it down
I'm not sure whether it's Wednesday or Thursday next week
because Mummy's at work next week now
pardon
mhm
that's right
when Mummy goes to work Nana and Granddad are coming to look after you „ aren't they

so he shut his eyes and snored „ didn't he
and then you kept shouting

and woke him up
and he jumped up „ didn't he
did you like Grandma and GranddadBealby

pardon
where as Purdie gone
she as gone back upstairs I would imagine
she as been outside „ hasn't she
and she as had her breakfast
so I would imagine she as gone upstairs to have a little look at Daddy
do you think Daddy's reading a paper
who's here
the postman
why are you talking quietly
who have you seen
you heard somebody
who did you hear
you saw what darling
somebody banged
did somebody come to the door
let me have a look
I didn't see anybody
where
where

pardon
you saw a fire engine
I can see your fire engine but I can't see a real one
let's put the Christmas tree lights on „ shall we
while I'm here
is that nice
and we've put the welcome lights on again „ haven't we
does that look pretty
I think Purdie as been sitting on the window sill Thomas because when I've pulled the blind back there's a little paw prints
so I shall hafta get the cloth later
will you remind me
to get the cloth
we've got to give the house a quick clean anyway „ haven't we
because
we've got people coming later
it looks fairly tidy because we weren't here „ were we
we've been in York
we cleaned before we went away
got some washing to do and a little bit of tidying
oh
yes
well that's the pram from underneath the stairs
you don't use that anymore „ do you
yes
you know
you probably can't remember but when you were a tiny baby you useta sleep in a carry cot that was the same color as that
it was blue
and it fitted on a little stand in Mummy and Daddy's bedroom
but then if we wanted to take you out for a walk we useta lift the carry cot off the stand in the bedroom and put it in this frame
and then we could wheel you all over
and then when you got a little bit older and wanted to see we could wind up the frame so that the head part was raised and you could look out
and then when you got too big for that we useta sleep you in the big cot upstairs
and then we'd put this other part of the pram onto the frame
and I don't know whether you remember you useta sit in that
we useta walk miles and miles and miles with you sitting in there looking out
we useta go to Tesco we useta go to Mother and Toddler groups park
do you remember sitting in that
because everybody said you looked like a little king
do you remember
I don't know whether you do really
you don't
oh it was beautiful to push
Mummy useta pile on the shopping up under it
can you see the little shopping basket underneath
and it as got a rain cover on it
and I remember going out with you one day and oh the rain was terrible and I couldn't hold an umbrella and push you at the same time
and you were nice and snug because you had this rain cover and Mummy was absolutely drenched
and then you got a little bit too big for that as well
it's sposta last until you're three years old
but you're a big boy
so we stopped using it
and then we started using the little pushchair that Grandma and Granddad gave us
but this pram here was so nice to push Thomas
absolutely gorgeous
but anyway the little carry cot part the part you useta sleep in went in the loft a long time ago
and we've had this behind the sofa
but now Mummy's going to give it a quick clean
and then we're going to pack it up and put it in the loft
and then do you know what we're going to do in the area behind the stairs
where the pram as been
we're going to put a big toy box there for you to put your toys in
because you've got such a lot of things for Christmas „ didn't you
oh
didn't you get a lot of things
pardon
you've got an orange
yes
but you've eaten that
you got an orange in your stocking from Santa „ didn't you
it did have a little pip
and now fancy Santa giving you an orange with a little pip in it
never mind
it was a nice orange „ wasn't it
it was lovely
pardon
did you eat two
well I think Santa only brought one „ didn't he
you possibly had two on Christmas day
but I think it was only one from Santa
AuntieLinda gave you one „ didn't she
you came back from Linda's house with a little satsuma
chocolates all gone
yes
when we went in before Christmas day she had a bowl of chocolates on the coffee table and you helped eat a lot of them „ didn't you
and then when we went back on Christmas day what had happened
they were all gone
you're laughing
are you laughing because you know you ate all of them
she didn't seem to mind though „ did she
she said they were for you
please may I have one of your Christmas tree sandwiches
thank you
thank you very much
are you enjoying the apple
the Christmas tree looks pretty „ doesn't it
can you see the lights twinkling
mhm
like a star
twinkle
there is a star on top of the tree „ isn't there
have you noticed the advent calendar on the door Thomas
the one that's in the shape of a tree
do you remember we took all the little shapes out of the pockets
oh well no
the calendar we had a bit of a disaster with that Thomas
it as fallen down the back of the unit
we'll try and get it out for you
but the Christmas tree advent calendar has a star on top of that tree
no sweetheart what happened the ThomasTheTankEngine calendar that we were counting down the days till Christmas Mummy put it back safely and it fell down the back
but there were chocolates in there to count down to the Millenium „ weren't there
to count down to the year two thousand
oh
well I
got more chocolates
yes
we've a lot of chocolates on the unit „ haven't we
they were all presents at Christmas
so what I'll do when you finish your apple if you fancy a chocolate I'll give you a chocolate from the advent village upstairs
because we had a little advent village „ didn't we
do you remember all those little houses
and we put chocolates inside
and each day before Christmas we opened a little house and had a chocolate
and when we
those chocolates
well Mummy bought more chocolates that we needed for the advent houses so we've got some left
so in a minute we'll have a chocolate
one of those chocolate balls
you don't want one

and tomorrow we'll hafta take the calendar down from the fridge „ won't we

and we'll hafta put a new one up

months
look
if we do Thursday third of April
we can't do nineteen ninety seven but we can take the nine and the seven off there and make that ninety seven
which pocket

Thursday the third of April ninety seven was the day that
Thomas was born
it's Thomas's birthday
is it
it's full
right
that one is November
that goes in the month
pocket
and that one's Wednesday and it goes in the day
you're quite right
that's very clever
I think we're going to hafta hang this up somewhere special „ aren't we
and then every day we can come to it
but during the day although the day and the date
oh be careful Tom
although the day and the date remain the same
oh that's May
that's a month
that wants to be in this pocket
sometimes during the day we might hafta swap these round
look
because it might start off cloudy and then become rainy
that's snowy
that's a snowman
look
it's saying it's snowy
yes
Mummy had a pussy cat called Snowy
look
can you see that photograph there off the white pussy cat
that's Mummy's pussy cat Snowy

spring was when you were born
when we had your birthday party
do you remember summer when the sun shone
autumn was when all the leaves fell
we made those nice pictures in autumn
and winter it's winter now
spring summer autumn winter
no
there's nothing on the back
that's what we hang it up with
it's a wall hanging
do you think that's very swish
oh yes
that's a little piece of wood
that's to keep it nice and stiff so that when we hang it on the wall it stays straight
and that says today
