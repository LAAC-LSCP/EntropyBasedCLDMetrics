right
what are we doing now
playing banks
okay
what do we hafta do to play banks
get down
oh you want money and I just give it to you
oh that sounds nice
right
oh you want me to sit down
oh I needta sit somewhere
well you haven't explained the rules
what are we doing
yeah
oh I see is that sposta be a cash machine
right
yes
do you needta turn it round so that you can put the money in
right
okay
so I come along with my cash card
I'll just move these shoes out of the way
right
I'll move this as well
oh listen motorbike
that's a noisy one
oh there is a cash card somewhere with a tin „ isn't there
oh well shall we get that one
no
if if this is a cash machine like the one we go to in Didsbury
well I go along
and you know that little card I have
right
is it
okay
well I'll need the card in that case then
alright well you put the card in the slot
and then it says something like your details are being checked or I don't know it says something
and then after a few seconds it says please key in your pin number now that's a number specially for me that no one else knows it's secret
and I hafta remember these numbers in my head
so then I tap in four numbers du
now I usually wanna take money out so I press that button
and then it comes up again on the screen how much do you want ten pounds twenty pounds thirty a hundred two hundred
and you press which one you want and your money comes out
and then your card comes out first you put your card away then your money comes out and you put your money away
and then you know what comes out of that little slit because you always get that one
paper now that's your little receipt
right
that's your receipt to tell you yes you've taken money out and how much you've got left
thank you
right
so I'm coming along now am I
alright so I put my card in first
I must tap in my number
what number shall I be today
nine but I need four numbers
I know what mine is
but do you wanna make one up or shall I just make one up myself
five nine
five nine two one
du
right
now it's asking me what I want
is it
right
okay
well I'll ask for ten pounds
it's the top off a pen
I'd be a bit disappointed if I went to the cash machine and I got the lid from a pen Thomas
do you think we'd better keep that lid safe because I think it's off one of Daddy's pens
oh wonderful and this is even better cause I asked the machine for ten pounds and it's given me how much
how much is that
what's that that number there
and what's that one
yeah
five and zero is
fifty
it's given me forty pounds more than I asked for
well I hope it doesn't know
I need a tissue Thomas just a second
oh
no
oh dear
well never mind what I'll hafta do is make sure I don't take any more money out of the machine
because if I do I won't have any left
right
I was hoping it didn't know and it was giving me an extra forty pounds
oh thank you what's this
a two pence piece
does that come from the machine as well
now is this a different machine because I think the machines that usually you have only give out notes they don't give out coins
oh wonderful
thank you now Thomas I've got money from the bank where shall we go
where shall we go
that's my my card is it
right
there's my card
pop it in the machine
we're withdrawing a lot of money „ aren't we
right
is now money coming out of the machine itself now
oh why is it broken
oh
what do you mean it doesn't charge lotsof money
oh I see
well do you think I should go in the bank and speak to a man behind the counter
could you be the man behind the counter
you could either be a bank clerk or you would you like to be the manager of the bank the bank manager
well I don't quite know what a bank manager does I think somebody will come and fill the machines one of the cashiers
the cashier
right
okay
but the bank manager is probably the man who says how much can go in it
I mean the manager's an important person „ isn't he
he runs the bank
hello
well you can go into shops where you can get money in a cash machine „ can't you
hello
well I'd like a bottle of CocaCola please
oh I thought you were the shopkeeper as well
the bank keeper the bank manager
right
hello
hello Mr bank manager
hello could I have some money please
now how much have I got in my bank account
four hundred pounds
or just four pounds
four pounds oh dear
oh
right
well I think if I've only got four pounds in I'd better actually leave it in the bank
until I get paid again
oh I've just been paid have I
and all this money has come in
but do you know what happens Thomas
when people go to work
when they work hard
they get paid
and the money that they earn goes into the bank
and then it's there in the bank for me to take out
which is why Mummy works hard to earn pennies
and why when we go to the cash machine there's usually money there but we can't take out too much cause Mummy doesn't get an awful lot of money
and you can only take out the amount you've got if you've no money the machine won't let you have any
and that's why many times when we're shopping and you see things that you like and you want I say I can't afford it
you know you can't have you can't buy absolutely everything you want otherwise we'd run out of money
and if we run out of money when you want things like new shoes and food to eat we'd have no money left we can't spend it all on toys
pardon
you want one more toy what would you like
a railway set
do you mean to play with now or you do you mean you'd like to buy one
oh well
again I don't think we've got any money really „ have we „ for toys
Thomas don't kick that
oh it'll be a lot more than one pence Thomas it depends what railway set you like
which one have you got your eye on
car barriers
you mean like the one that Clare with Jeannine and Dimitra
well I would imagine that's quite an expensive one
ask Jeannine
well it might be a pound but I doubt it very because I think Dimitra bought that actually Thomas
but I think maybe Jeannine's bought some more bits and pieces to go with it „ don't you
pardon
alright what do you mean we're going over we're going over what
oh we're going to
do you
well when we go to Jeannine's next
alright then we'll get on but I'm just saying when we go to Jeannine's you remember to ask her
okay
right
come on then I'm waiting for you to tell me what we're doing
yes
okay
and you've got the money
I can't even see you round there Thomas why don't you come round
oh are you in the staff room
well I must admit you don't usually see the bank manager when you go to a bank unless you've got a problem
and then you needta see the bank manager
you're more likely to see one of the cashiers working behind the counter
isn't that right
well I wouldn't talk to you normally when I went to the bank
I'd like to talk to me though Thomas
and how do I do that do I ring the bell
right
so this has just come from the cash machine „ has it
ohgosh there's a lot of money here
fifty one hundred
one hundred and fifty two hundred
good heavens
I've got two hundred and twenty
two hundred and thirty pounds what on earth is that noise
down
I don't know but this always happens whenever we do tapes someone starts doing something
right
I'll just have a look
that's it well I'll just stop this tape for a minute

oh I've got lotsof money
oh no not again
oh we stopped and we thought it had all stopped but it hadn't
I presume he's finished cause a minute ago we thought he'd finished and he started up again
what do you think it is he's doing Thomas
drilling I know but what's he drilling you told me what you thought it was before
a big motorbike
so what happened to the duck pond
how did it
but how did the duck pond end up being broken
did it just stop working
oh look another delivery truck outside
what color's this one
yellow and green and wait that says oh initial city Lincoln and it's driven off
it stopped I think he was just reading an address hold on
it was
I don't know
what do you think
more sweets and toys for Thomas Lastname
look
he's driving past turned round and now what's it doing
it's going to
Liam's house let's have a look let's open the blind
whoops a daisy what's all those things doing there
it is and the driver's got out of his van he's got a clipboard and he's going to Liam's house isn't he
well he must have
Olivia where's Olivia
oh
yes
so she is
that's right
Olivia's with her Mummy „ isn't she
pardon
yes
she does
well at least her Mummy does
I don't know whether Olivia does
yes
because Olvia's Mummy Tricia and Georgia's Mummy Jane are both nurses they work together and they're best friends
and so they spend a lot of time together
so is Olivia just going to Jane's house
Georgia's house
well
no
because they've obviously made arrangements to see one another haven't they
no
don't put that one in there
well
no
you can't do that Thomas
because they've obviously arranged perhaps on their own to have lunch together or something
right
did the delivery man find someone in at Liam's house
no
there's nobody there
oh dear
that's a bit of a nuisance „ isn't it
right
I think Brian has stopped his drilling now
I am
what happened to the duck pond you were telling me
it just stopped working „ did it
how did they notice it had stopped working
oh I see so at first you thought that Brian had switched the pump off
but then when Brian said he hadn't and he double checked and the pump switch said on
and it had just completely stopped working he hadn't touched it had he
no
nobody touched it
no
I'm not accusing you of that darling I'm sorry I didn't mean to sound as if I was blaming you
I was just curious to know what had happened
so was it actually working when you got there and just stopped working
it just finished and so Linda must have thought right and turned it off
goodness me
oh well I wonder if that's what he's doing now but certainly that drilling was a bit noisy and it always seems to be Tom when we're together
and we have a few minutes just on our own
and we think right let's make Jeannine a story
and goodness me something happens
do you remember that time when Linda and Brian had a new conservatory and then they had a new boiler
and it was every single time we decided we would do some jobs then whoop the noise would start and that was it
right
there we are well while we were having that little break
waiting for the noise to settle we've watched a delivery driver we've seen Olivia
and
have you seen Georgia as well
right
are we going back to this bank now
and I suggest when we get some money out of the bank
we pretend we're going
oh don't do that Thomas
we'll pretend we're going to a cafe and we can have
well I might have a cup of coffee because I feel quite thirsty
would you like an apple and a drink
alright well we'll play banks a little bit longer and we'll see if the bank manager's kind enough to give us money to go and have a snack
right
shall we go and see
let's go and try to get some money out of the cash machine
right
see are you going to come with me
right
okay
right
now I'll put my card in the slot
jjum
do you know what I did one day Thomas
my Tesco club card you know when you buy shopping at Tesco and you know you've done this with Nana as well
you hand them a card and they put some points on it so you can buy new things
I once put my Tesco club card in the card cash machine
and it shot the card out and said it was incorrect
and I tried it again and it kept the card and I realized I hadn't put the bank card in I'd put the Tesco card in it's a wonder I wasn't arrested
you'd have liked that „ wouldn't you
would you not
yeah

you'd love to have seen Mummy in the back of a police car „ wouldn't you
ho I'm glad that's amused you
right
so here we card in the slot
szoop
oh it's shot it out
put the card in the slot
szoom
oh
no
it's my Boots card it's my Boots advantage card
dear me I'll try this one
it is a bank card
okay
card in the machine szoop
oh
no
oh
no
this is my Tesco one

right
this one will do szoom
Sainsbury's

szoom
oh this is my bank card and it shot it out why
let me try again
szoom
oh I mustn't have any money in my bank
alright
szoom
I wonder if it's
oh the receipt's coming out but no money
what's the receipt say
oh it's a train ticket
oh it says I've no money in my bank I'd better go and have a word with the manager inside
uhoh
bingbong
hello may I speak with the manager please
oh hello Mr bank manager I'm terribly sorry I seem to have a problem with my bank account I put my card in and
well
yes
that's what it's given me but it says I haven't got any money but I don't understand it as I thought I had plenty of money
thank you
do you think it's the machine rather than the fact that I haven't any money in the
oh we'll just
right
so I went szoop
oh it's given me some pennies out
alright let's count them
one
Thomas don't
because it's the china cabinet if you kick that everything will fall off the shelves and smash
one pound fifty sixty seventy one pee one pound and seventy one pee
is that all I have
right
oh
no
don't give me bills to pay as well
Thomas will you please move away from that cupboard
now I'm not quite sure what you mean now Thomas
so you're going to charge me now for taking money out of my account
oh dear
well I don't know what to do my little boy wants a drink or an apple I'd like a drink we need some money
have I not been working hard enough this month
or do you think it's an error do you think that
no
money
is it just the people I work for forgot to put the money in the bank
oof thank goodness for that
right
so shall I try again Mr bank manager
with my card
szoom
oh it's shot the card out again
Mr bank manager will you help me please I'm a bit fed up with this machine it just keeps putting my card in and out
could you give me some money please out of the till
shall I write to cheque or can I just tell you how much I want
oh that sounds really good
I can hear something I'm just trying to ignore it Thomas

is that what I've got
them notes
well don't put that down there it'll end up going down the back of the settee and we won't get it back
so it's just coins I can't have any notes
oh wonderful
oh well that's plenty that's quite enough to go and do my shopping with thank you
thank you I don't need any more thank you Mr bank manager
oh my goodness he's gone mad he's throwing money at me

I think he's just sick of having me in his bank he wants rid of me „ don't you
hello

I want you to be cheap or very rich

I'd like me to be very rich Thomas wouldn't that be nice
what would you do if you had lotsof money
get all the toys for you what sort of toys would you like then
all of the scary monsters to kill me
well that's not nice
if I was very rich and you killed me you wouldn't be able to get your hands on my money
Thomas don't do that please

no
no
suddenly from thinking I only had one pound seventy one pence I'm a millionaire
oh I can hear a helicopter now
is it a helicopter or is it a plane
one of those squirrels
from the cash machine
excuse me Mr bank manager
something very strange I've just been to the cash machine and I've actually found this hose sticking out of the hole in the wall now why is that
oh I see so when you needta close the bank you turn the fire hose on people do you
what is it
the electric pipe and what does
yes
with electric pipes
yes
okay
yes
you cut your foot
have you made it dirty
where
where
I can't see any blood
I can't see blood but I can hear
oh
yes
is that from your shoe
let's have a look at the other foot as well
it's only on one side „ isn't it
that's a little bit strange
I don't understand that
wanted it to be bedtime are you tired
break time
okay
well have we got enough money I'm sure if we're millionaires
where was the electric cable coming through the cash machine
the bank manager doesn't serve tea and coffee „ does he
is that what the hose pipe is
it's not a hose pipe it's an electric cable serving drinks
what sort of drink would you like
oh dear
well I'm afraid all that's on offer Thomas is Ribena or water
or an apple what would you like
an apple
would you like a drink as well
okay
and I think I'll have cup of coffee
so I'll cut your apple up while the kettle's boiling
oh
yes
real food you do want a real apple „ don't you
pardon
has it
goodness
do you wanna go to the table
I can't hear what you're saying why are you hopping around why have you wrapped that hose pipe around your foot
you sillybilly
well be careful leaping around like that you know what'll happen
you'll end up really hurting yourself
and that's all we need
look at the size of this apple it's absolutely huge
whoops
what's gone into it
what do you mean what's gone into it
just look at the inside of that apple

well I've got to take the core out darling and the pips


Thomas
no
no
because I've got to take the pips out of it
but to do that I needta cut it
cause you waste it when you have a full apple
what I should have done what we'll do the next time
I'll use the apple corer
take the whole core out
then you can have
a big apple „ can't you
is it tasty
does it taste as nice as it looks „ or not
even nicer
well I'm going to have a piece
I've got little bowl to put these pieces in
oh wow it is nice that
now this is more refreshing „ isn't it

how's that
no
I
I can't tell what you're saying Thomas
oh I see which Tesco's the apples have been in
yes
which Tesco have they come from
York
YorkTesco
why do you think they've been in YorkTesco
oh
right
huh
who would tell you that
oh they're very nice „ aren't they
definitely refreshing
and really the size of them it's like having two smaller apples „ isn't it
they're bigger than smaller ones
yes
but what I mean is some sometimes apples you know you have two there's still a little gap in your tummy but I think with
certainly now you've had one or these
mind you having said that I pinched a quarter from you so it isn't
how dare
well I said please
I didn't help you did I
ah well now you know how it feels when people just take things from you without saying please or thank you
right
there's your drink
forget we've been to the cash machine and we need money to pay for these drinks
the lady in the cafe won't be very pleased „ will she „ if we just walk out without paying
am I
how much do you think a nice big apple a drink of ribena
you're the server serving at
what

ninety hundred pence
well I think that's a little bit expensive „ don't you
no
I'm surprised you have so many customers when you charge such a lot
why what
heads
what's that mean
huh who said that
Bella
oh Bella on the Tweenies
well shall we walk out of this cafe because it's a bit expensive
and then the lady might think about charging such ridiculously high charges in future
no
we'll just leave it on the table and we'll walk out
well alright we'll ask her again very nicely if we can have it for for
I would have thought
I would have thought two or three pounds would have covered the bill
oh wow
oh she's gone to the other extreme now she's hardly charging any money at all

have we
a one penny piece
I'm sure we do needta pay and how much is the ribena and the coffee
know each other
we do as I say you're not ashamed to know me „ are you
you don't wanna pretend you don't know me
just mind there some things look behind you on the sofa that
they're not smelly socks they're freshly washed clean socks that are folded up and ready to go upstairs when I go upstairs
I could do without them being knocked off
but it's very quiet now Brian has stopped his drilling Thomas
and it only lasted a little while „ didn't it
which is just as well
perhaps Brian's stopped to have a drink of ribena or an apple or a mug of coffee what do you think
mug of coffee and an apple do you think that's the sort of thing Brian would have for his break
perhaps if he was mending the duck pond he's now sitting in the garden drinking his cup of coffee watching the pond work
what does the pond do Thomas
comes down the rocks the water does
oh I see it just turns the water round and round does it
is that what the pump does
water comes down the rocks swirls round the pool
yeah
I see
so it's the same water all the time it's just going round and round
and have they got ducks floating on it
oh it's just I thought it was a duck pond
I know they've rocks at the side „ haven't they
they'd got that big JemimaPuddleduck ornament „ haven't they
what else have
oh she didn't
not when you were with her
oh
no
bow
no
what happened
with you
oh Tom what happened
but you were playing cricket together
and which one of you hit JemimaPuddleduck with a cricket bat
did she
oh
no
oh
no
that's terrible
it was embarrassing

oh why didn't you tell me this before Thomas this is embarrassing now
well I'm glad you find it funny
was Linda terribly upset
Brian stuck it on
right
yeah
oh
no
I can't tell what you're saying now cause you're a bit giddy and you're eating your apple
right
carry on with your story it's a good story this but I shall hafta go and see Linda in a minute and
yeah
oh
no
oh she'll be ever so upset
well actually I can see that little pond if I get into your bedroom window
if I stand on your bed cause I don't usually look into the neighbor's garden but if I
well that's right it's cheeky „ isn't it
so I don't do that but I can see it if I do that so I shall go and have a look in a few minutes
and just see what I can see
oh dear because she's got other ornaments she's got is it RogerRabbit
do you remember when you were very young and you hadta say goodnight to RogerRabbit every night
we useta put you to bed and we useta hafta look out of the window and say nanight Roger
oh
no
you knocked the head right over the fence
I don't think so Thomas
no
I think you're making it up
I think Linda would have told us if you'd done that much damage
oh dear
and apart from a headless JemimaPuddleduck
what
right
well we'll have a look we'll take the microphone up
be careful my hot coffee's on the floor
we'll take one of the microphones up
one should be alright
don't shout
don't shout out of the window Thomas please
right
excuse me
Brian's got his Dad out
alright shush we don't want a running commentary love
we wanna see
have a little nap
there's the bed
right
there's the duck pond
pebbles and flowers
I can't see anything at all
I can't even see Jemima
I can see
oh it's Normanthegnome „ isn't it and Roger rabbit
Normanthegnome is the other thing I was looking for
Tiddles what their cat
I can't see her from here
where
oh
no
that's not Tiddles that's Molly
yeah
she's well disguised „ isn't she
yes
she's under the bench that's nice and there's some other people outside
yes
I can
right
well I'll speak to Linda about the Puddleduck
oh well I can see a little duck floating in the pond Thomas
I can see some ducks floating but they're not real „ are they


see your place
oh sit at your table sorry I thought you said see your place
sit at your place
yes
that would be nice „ wouldn't it
thank you very much
right
I lost track of the time
let's just see where we're up to
oh sorry is your flashing again
it's such a strange thing this because
pardon
well the thing is most of the time the orange light is on
it's just every now and again it just for some reason stops working
oh it is a nuisance it really is
should get Brian to have a look with his drill
do you think
there you see it's working now
the orange light's on
and now it's gone off
oh it's on it's it seems to be when I'm near it
when I'm near it it works it must be when I walk away
it's a little like the radio in the bathroom
that does silly things like that
right
I'll just stop the tape a minute while I sort this out
it was
look
look we can't just stay here all the time „ can we
so how did Brian stick JemimaPuddleduck's head back on the duck Thomas
with glue
well it probably was quite well stuck
seriously
the delivery man
oh it's Fred
no
it's Fred
who else
did he
well I can't sit here like this holding this „ can I
that's silly
what are you playing with now Thomas
delivery train
that was just a little idea I had then because it seems to work with something weighing down the end
oh we've got banging now again
I thought if I just hung that on them that would make it heavy
how about a shoe
no
too heavy
that's a good bang noise
a mallet
mm
I think he's doing more than mending his pond now „ don't you
do you think so
well it might be something like aerial that just when you think it's fixed you discover that it's actually not
right
I might turn it off all together cause sometimes I find when I turn it off when it's been playing up I turn it back on and everything works perfectly

it actually seems to go off when
the tape's on „ doesn't it
works
works perfectly until I turn the tape back off
could you just check the batteries for me darling
we'll just see that we've got green lights on both the microphones
I don't know where
there's one on the mantelpiece there should be one up here
is there one up there
that's the one off the mantelpiece that's right
on the china cabinet I think
right
so the batteries are working fine
and actually the aerial seems to be working fine as well now
just get them
I'm going to just take a
okay
I'm just going to take the mixer from your toy box to just prop this up
but we don't needta
yes
we do
no
we don't
oh
the trouble is I mean Thomas the lady's listening to the tape
you can't hear properly if one of the microphones is playing up
and it's very annoying to them listening
I'm sure that was equally annoying you being a noisy boy instead of talking
are you still eating that apple

it was a jolly big apple „ wasn't it
we like apples „ don't we Thomas
my knees are warm
your toe nails are dirty
you've been wandering around outside without socks and shoes „ haven't you
pardon
scrub them there „ are you
oh Thomas that's hurting me
yes
I do and it's working fine at the moment
it's like a Belisha beacon flashing orange on off
you know what Belisha beacons are „ don't you
they don't have them very often now they have them where Nana lives
you know on a zebra crossing
a zebra crossing
the road has black and white stripes painted over it „ doesn't it
that's where you can cross the road
and where we live we have lotsof what are called pelican crossings where we've got those little buttons you press it and it says
wait
and the red man comes on and then when the green man goes off we go trotting across the road
but where there are zebra crossings and they're called Belisha beacons they're big poles which are black and white and on the top there's a big ball of orange and it flashes on off
it's to warn motorists that we're crossing
it always reminds
what the banging
ah
the orange light's working but only while I'm sitting here holding it and if I put it down
so I'll hafta just
I know it's fine

yeah

when I was a little girl we useta go into a cafe
can't think where it was now it was perhaps when we went on a coach trip somewhere
and on the counter there was a huge plastic box
it was a sort of refrigerated box and it there would be fresh oranges
they'd been twirled round and round and round in this machine making juice
and it useta have an orange sign that useta flash on and off and it useta remind me of a Belisha beacon I don't know why
I'm trying to think somewhere we're bound to have a picture
have you never seen
well you've seen one when we go to Nana's definitely
you know
zebra
you've seen zebra crossings or level crossings
zebras
yeah
because when you come out of Nana's house you walk down the street and then you pass the dairy you know where the milk floats are
I bet it does
and then you pass the butchers and then right outside the butchers it's the zebra crossing crossing over to the church
beep
I don't think it does you know that's the thing it's not a pelican crossing with a beepy „ is it
it's just an orange light flashing on a pole

that people will be crossing at that point
