it's not very nice „ is it
out and about with Tom and Pippo
we'll read the one about going for a walk
oh shall we read the one about shopping as well
right
here we are
we'll start with this one
Tom and Pippo in the snow
one morning it had snowed really hard
Daddy bought a sledge and said that we should take it up a hill
I took Pippo because he wanted to come
we had never been on a sledge before
we took the sledge up the hill
I thought Pippo would like to have first go
Daddy said there was nothing to be frightened of
but I said it was only fair to let Pippo go on the sledge first
I could tell he wanted too
so Daddy brought Pippo to the top of the hill and I waited at the bottom
Daddy said if Pippo can do it I'm sure you can too
I said to Daddy why don't we all go on the sledge
but Daddy said the sledge was really too small
so in the end I went all by myself
going on a sledge is really very easy
Pippo and I go by ourselves all the time
we don't need Daddy
and they do go shopping
yes
the next page we turn to is the yellow page
and that's the story about going shopping
Tom and Pippo go shopping
today Mummy and I went shopping
we went shopping today „ didn't we
where did we go
supermarket
no
we didn't really do any shopping „ did we
today Mummy and I went shopping
I took Pippo
Pippo likes to go to the shops
I said he would love a little piece of bread
but I ate it
I said Pippo would love a ripe juicy plum
but I ate it
Pippo wanted just a little piece of cheese from the cheese counter
but I ate it
oh
and when we ad bought all the shopping Mummy gave me the money and said I could pay
Mummy had a cup of tea and I had a little drink
but there wasn't enough for Pippo
anyway I'll give Pippo some tea when we get home
and this is called Tom and Pippo go for a walk
Mummy and I were going for a walk
Mummy said it was very cold outside and I must wear my hat scarf and gloves
Pippo wanted to come for a walk too
I made him put on his hat and scarf
and I told him he would catch a cold if he didn't
Mummy held Pippo while I went for a run down the hill
Pippo wanted to run with me but we fell over
Mummy put me straight in the bath
but Pippo hadta go in the basin
then Pippo and I sat by the fire and had
a warm drink
right
I think it's time for
oh is that the sand pit one
shall we read the sand pit one
one day Mummy took me to a place where you could play in the sand pit
and I found a lovely bucket
I was just making castles with the bucket when this little girl came and tried to take it away from me
she said it was her bucket
the little girl's Mummy said we should share our toys
I really wanted to play with that bucket
and Pippo wanted to play with it too
so in the end we all played together in the sand pit
today we're going to the sand pit again
I hope the little girl is there with her bucket
what's this one
I often take Pippo into the garden
he likes to ride in my wheel barrow
I take him round the paths and bump him down the steps
Pippo likes to be bumped
when we've had enough I give him his dinner
Pippo makes a mess when he eats
he gets food all over his face
when I hear Mummy calling I make a little bed for Pippo
so he can sleep while I eat my lunch
you had a sleep after lunch today „ didn't you
after lunch when we wanna play that cat is asleep in my wheel barrow
we hafta shoo him out
and then I take Pippo round and round the garden
until it's time to go in for tea
