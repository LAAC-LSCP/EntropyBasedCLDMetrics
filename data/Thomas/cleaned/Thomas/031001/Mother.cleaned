that's right
yes
it did „ didn't it
it gave you a headache
ooh
it sounds as if we've got a lot of screeching
I just hafta sort some wires out
ooh
gosh
a bit of testing
it needs a bit of something
not sure what
just a minute
now if we're going to do these buns and cakes
well we needta sort out what the problem is „ don't we
is it still screeching
or is it better now
is it still too noisy
oh I think that's alright „ isn't it
I think the microphone on top of the cooker hood it must've been too metal for it
right poppet
if we're going to do these buns we're going to wash our hands and put aprons on „ okay
is it still whistling Thomas
is it hurting your ears
I don't understand it really
the problem's
nothing happening through that one
no
I think there is
I can hear something
there you are
right
I'll talk to you
you put it in that ear
right
can you hear me talking to you
well put it in that ear
right
can you still hear me talking to you
very good
yes
that's right
little headphones
yes
I think that's so that the pilot can hear what's going on „ don't you
he can hear the people in control of him
directing him through the sky cause sometimes it's very cloudy „ isn't it
is he
so we don't want noisy babies and children on the plane „ do we
right
let's have a listen Thomas
just let me listen once more
I think we seem alright „ don't we
I can hear something that sounds like an aeroplane
and there isn't an aeroplane „ is there
oh there is an aeroplane
well that's good cause there sounded like there was one through the headphones
can you hear it still
can you still hear it
let me have a little listen poppet please
what can you hear
can you
does it
your ears are a little sensitive after your ear infection at Christmas „ aren't they
don't touch those wires please Thomas
oh I see
it was a proper aeroplane

that's strange „ isn't it
right
let's get our hands washed and then we can
put our aprons on
please don't touch that
it might knock the tape off altogether
can you
can you
but you're quite right
when pilots fly planes they do have ear plugs in „ don't they
oh dear
poor Thomas

there's a little knot in this wire
let me just sort it out for you

that was his job to make the plastic cartons to the margarine cartons
what do you think to that

I can't remember his name
Michael the margarine man „ shall we call him
although he actually said he didn't make the margarine
he didn't even put the margarine into the tubs

I can't tell what you're saying Thomas
on my spoon
pardon
what did you say
oh is that what the old washing powder box is for
are you
well we've just had a little break cause Daddy wanted to run the bath and you wanted a wee wee
so while you were gone I've given this mixture a really good up
what do you think to that
does it look a different color now

mhm
that smells nice „ doesn't it
you're digging up the earth „ are you
the two wooden spoons are diggers „ are they
yes
well they look like two wooden spoons but I suppose yes I suppose with a bit of imagination we could pretend they were diggers „ couldn't we

b for big spoon
no

which one would you like
how many pennys is that
well I'll give you the small weight
right
I'm going to tap it on the side
gosh
we had this the other day
I think it must be the bowl
the little plastic bowl
I don't think it's strong enough
if it was a pot bowl they'd be a bit more weight behind it to crack the egg
goodbye egg man
don't push it too far Thomas
if it falls on the floor it'll break
it is
well
not when you deliver them
right
I'm going to beat it up now
would you like to have a beat on the egg
you might splash it on your new truck
if you move those two fire hoses

there we are
now
we're going to tip
why do we need them
no I was meaning that I wanted them moved so that there was room for the bowl
now are we going to tip
there's a lot of aeroplanes in the sky at the moment „ aren't there

eggs
oh well

Luke Foster

well
well I don't need any more eggs Mr egg man but I'd like you to tip this egg that I've beaten into the egg mixture please
very carefully
beautiful
thank you
now are you still the grocer man
well in that case I would like another teaspoon full of flour please from the big flour sack
put it through the sieve
thank you so much
and now that as got to be given a good mix „ hasn't it
and I'm going to need some more flour in a few minutes from the flour man
be careful with those Thomas
pop it back in the box
when you say a big Tesco truck are you thinking of the very big trucks that deliver to Tesco or are you thinking of the little van that comes round if we order food over Daddy's computer
the man that comes with the blue boxes
is that who you're thinking of
does she
right
I tell you what
I tell you what
pop those eggs into an egg box for her and then she'll put them back in her fridge please

wiping all the spilt mixture with a cloth
now
can I have all the flour man please to call my house

right
we've got to put that through the sieve
there we are
thank you
don't get the cloth near this Thomas
he put the cloth over his van „ did he
to cover it up
that's a good idea „ isn't it
now we've got to mix the flour into this mixture
are you going to help with this
no
is it
have you lost interested in making buns
a fire at the bakery perhaps
perhaps somebody else making buns has left them in the oven too long
and what happens if you leave something in the oven too long
catches fire „ doesn't it
Mummy this is the blanket where the chips van did burnt it
oh I see
the chip pan caught fire so you put the cloth over the chip pan
it's a very sensible thing to do „ isn't it
got to be a damp cloth though „ hasn't it
from your high street

cause if you put a dry cloth over that would catch fire as well „ wouldn't it
right
the mixture's done now Thomas
I need help now from the man with the bun cases and the bun tray
would you like to sit in your chair and do that bit
then you can rest your legs
you have a little sit down there

right
just wondering that myself

well when we fill this
listen
when we've done this
we can have a little break and a drink cause these have got to bake and we'll hafta turn the tape recorder off while the oven's on cause it's a fan oven

well they won't be baked „ will they
have we something left
in the tin
right
no sit still please Thomas while I do this
ohgosh

that means the battery's running out
well spotted Thomas
where as it gone
I don't know
I think it's on the floor somewhere
right
well the equipment's still working down here so
perhaps the battery needs a little rest as well in that case
well you did darling actually
it's an old washing powder box
Persil tablet box
what are you looking for
the hoses
yeah
well I thought they were under the table
I don't know in that case
you not see them anywhere
right
I'm going to get my fingers dirty now cause I'm going to put this mix into the bun cases just using my fingers
what do you think to that
what's the matter Thomas
please don't go on that equipment
no I don't think we want anything in the rubbish at them moment „ do we
no thank you
that's Mummy's tissue
don't use that Thomas cause we've used it to blow noses on
don't play with it
no
is it
the flower service is for catching flys „ is it
it always reminds me of a fishing net
Thomas come here please
come here please
come here please
it's sailing back „ is it
I don't think so
there might be some later but I've already put the egg shells in the rubbish
I don't think we've got anymore rubbish
the cone
yes
well you left that on the floor last night and I think it as been trodden on
it was broken this morning
a stranger
no
I would imagine it was Daddy when he got up this morning probably didn't put the light on and didn't see it
what's the matter
are you
oh that's a little mystery isn't it Thomas
we bought some batterys put them both in on exactly the same date from the same packet and the microphones have been turned on for exactly the same length of time and one of them is showing red and the other one isn't
well why do you think that is
what's the reason for that then
yes that green one as gone green one has gone green that shows the battery's going flat and the other one's okay so I don't understand that „ do you
the fireman
I don't think I've ever called the fire brigade out before Thomas for having a flat battery
no thank you
that as got to go off Thomas
right
no more pressing that please
it's too noisy
did you find your hoses
I didn't
where do you think they are
hiding somewhere
have you had a good look round
have you had a very good look round
you can't find them anywhere
oh right
that's quite a good station that „ isn't it
that old Persil tablet box
but you can't fit it in
think he'll go in one way „ won't he
well that's just a case of twiddling it until it fits in „ isn't it
don't press that again please Thomas
no
no thankyou
no that's not a noisy machine
we don't want noisy machine
it as started to rain again now outside
well at least there'll be no shortage of water outside for your hosepipe „ will there
