did you say the green light was on
pardon
oh good
good
well that's the microphone
so we need those lights on „ don't we
because if the lights aren't on it means the batterys have gone flat and it's not working properly
so we hafta keep looking „ don't we
to check that the green light is on
well yes
when we look at the actual piece of equipment the orange light
yes
it comes on
it means that it's plugged into the electricity
and when the green lights come on it means that the batterys are working
and when the little red light is on it means the machine itself is turned on
so we've got to look at the red light on the machine
the green light on these two microphones
and then on the monitors we've got to check there's a green and a red light
so that's five lights we've got to look for
and the other day what happened
no electricity
I forgotten what day that was
was it Monday
we plugged everything in and checked it was working turned the microphones on
they were working
then we did a recording „ didn't we
and then when it finished
you wanted a drink of milk
well probably sweeties as well
and when we went to warm the milk nothing in the kitchen worked
so we turned the television on
that didn't work
there was no electricity „ was there
and then when we listened to our recording
it hadn't recorded anything „ had it
because the electricity must have gone off just after I checked that the lights were on
and what I normally do is I just check
once we've checked initially that those are working we just check these two „ don't we
to look for green lights
yes
we never went back to see if there were green and orange lights „ did we
so that was a complete waste of time
and then what did we find had happened
when we out for a walk
what had happened to the lamp post
do you remember when we went down not our road we walked round Kempstone
KempstoneAvenue
somebody had hit the lamp post „ hadn't they
it had fallen down
and there were all bollards and cones and pieces of wood round it
and Norweb boards
and then we saw the Norweb van outside and we realized that must have been what had happened
somebody had hit the lamp post and they ad hadta turn the electricity off to mend it
Thomas honey nut loops Cornflakes or RiceKrispies

and you've got some Teletubbies plates and bowls
and a nice Po mug „ haven't you

oh dear
when was this
oh what did he bang you with
a hammer
a play hammer or a police hammer
a police hammer
did it hurt you
did you tell MissusPlatford why you were crying
oh well
unless you tell people why she won't be able to do anything about it
but this is why I tell you you mustn't hit people
because it hurts and upsets people and then they won't wanna be your friend
because now you're saying you don't like James
and that's why „ isn't it
and you don't want people to say oh I don't like ThomasHenry because he hit me over the head „ do you
you spit at people
oh that's not nice „ is it
is that what you did to James when he hit you
oh right
because you told me about this
he doesn't understand
you did what
oh Thomas
you didn't knock him on the road and a bus ran over his bottom
you mustn't get into fights with little friends
must you
hm
what are the other little boys called
Sarah
that little girl
SarahJane
SarahJane
oh is there a little girl there called SarahJane
is she nice
she banged you on the head as well

I don't think MissusPlatford banged you on the head „ did she
and what about Emma
Emma pushed you

mm
did you have a nice night's sleep last night
you very tired when you went to bed
Mummy cleaned the fridge last night
because it was dirty
and a lot of things needed sorting out
and when I cleaned it I caught the button that works the temperature
the thing in the fridge that makes it feel very cold
Mummy knocked the switch
this one here
I touched it when I was cleaning
and when I got up this morning the fridge was turned off
but we checked and everything still seems frozen in the freezer this morning
just checked the ice cream „ haven't we
that happened the other day actually „ didn't it
I think sometimes when the fridge is very full we put a lot of things in it
and that knocks the button as well
you know the when the fridge is really full like Christmas and your BirthdayParty
because it happened the other day „ didn't it
the fridge had been turned off
and I know it's not you going in because we've got a lock on the fridge „ haven't we
well to stop people going in
and stealing my milk and cheese
do you remember the day Thomas that we went to Sonia and Isabelle's house for a book party
and Sonia's friend was selling a lot of books
a little
mhm
DaddyRod's house
yes
and Reardon was there with yourself and JakeKelly
and Reardon got into Sonia's fridge and emptied it „ didn't he
and Sonia wasn't very pleased „ was she
well because all her food was all over the floor
Reardon's Mummy was too busy reading the books and nobody noticed
and JakeKelly was helping „ wasn't he
pardon

mhm
Mummy's very tired this morning Thomas
do you know what I'd really like to do
go to sleep
I'd like to go back to bed
and go to sleep
and I've got a nice cup of tea here
so I'd like to finish my cup of tea and go back upstairs
would you like to come as well
would you
drink of coffee
you'd like a drink of coffee first „ would you
and then what would we do
read some books
story books
and would we have a cuddle
and then what
we close our eyes
and snore
that's right
we go to sleep
shall we take Purdie with us
because Purdie as got her little bed at the side of Mummy's bed „ hasn't she
near the radiator
Purdie as got a bed near the radiator and window
everything she needs
so she can have a sleep and then jump into the window and have a little play outside
and we could all have a sleep „ couldn't we
do you think she would
that would wake us up „ wouldn't it
we don't really want her to wake us up „ do we
can you see her looking out of the window
nothing's really happening this morning „ is it
no lorrys to look at
no trucks
oh Stephen as just walked past
I don't know
I think he as
he's going home
pardon
he's going home for his Mummy
well Stephen's Liam's Daddy „ isn't he
so I don't think he'll be going home to his Mummy
I think he's just gone back to his house
oh he's probably taking Liam to school
he as probably walked Liam to school do you think
because he takes him quite early „ doesn't he
he takes him and Georgia
no it's very quiet outside
absolutely nothing's happening
yes
Linda and Brian are shuting their door
perhaps Linda's going to work
do you think it's time for her to go to work
right
I'm putting some toast in the machine now Thomas
okay
mm mm
what would you like on your toast this morning
orange jam
you mean marmalade
orange marmalade
yes
we quite like that „ don't we
and would you like a few grapes
yes please
I'll wash some grapes
and peel them
I don't think we needta peel them
we did when you were a baby but you're not a baby anymore
they say they're seedless so we don't hafta take any seeds out
did you enjoy those Cornflakes
Ben and Charlotte come back from holiday today
pardon
sorry I had the water running
I couldn't tell what you said
their car
well they've been to Greece on an aeroplane „ haven't they
they left their car at home
I would imagine they're coming home in a taxi
so I don't think we'll see them today
I don't know what time they get home
but I would doubt we'll see them at all today
perhaps we'll see them on Thursday
tomorrow
mind you tomorrow Thomas Jeannine's
oops that's the toast
Jeannine's coming tomorrow morning
pardon
no
not now
in the morning
tomorrow morning
you thought she was coming now
no
and then Thursday afternoon you're going to nursery again
pardon love
Mummy as gone
well you always know I'm coming back Thomas „ don't you
you always know Mummy's coming back for you poppet
there you are
there's your grapes
now I'll get us some toast to eat
thing is though when you're at nursery Thomas
Mummy's doing all sorts of jobs at home
like vacuuming and ironing
cleaning and you don't like it when Mummy does those jobs
you like it when Mummy's at home playing with you and talking to you „ don't you
so it makes sense if Mummy can have a couple of hours on her own doing jobs you don't like
while you're playing with the other children and doing some painting and all the other things you do
isn't it
and then when we come back together you can tell me all about it „ can't you
what a good time you've had
Mummy will always come back for you Thomas
I'm not leaving you there
we left your bag there „ didn't we
last weekend
but that was a mistake
and we went back to get that
we didn't even leave your bag „ did we
so there's no way I'm going to leave you
is that what upsets you
that you think Mummy's leaving you
I'm not leaving you at all love
just for a few minutes
just for the afternoon „ isn't it
those grapes nice Thomas
nice and sweet
is Ginger here
where
oh hello Ginger
well this is Purdie's food from last night
it's just a little bit that she didn't eat
so I think Ginger can have some of that „ can't he
yes
Purdie's scared of Ginger „ isn't she
there we are
I've saved that little bit of food for him
Purdie wouldn't eat it anyway
here you are Puss
he doesn't look as if he as got paint on his body anymore
perhaps got a faint mark
but it as gone „ hasn't it
there we are
just rinse my hands
and Purdie's a fussy pussy and she won't eat the food that as been left over from the night before „ will she
and she always leaves something on the plate

pardon darling
you've got Cornflakes down your arm
how have you got Cornflakes down you arm

you're getting dressed in a few minutes „ aren't you

I've just filled the washing up bowl up with water ready to wash the pots up after breakfast
you would like orange marmalade on this
sounds like proper toast that „ doesn't it
crunchy crispy
marmalade
that's right
orange marmalade
which plate would you like to eat your toast and marmalade
WinniethePooh again
BobtheBuilder
we haven't got a plate with tractors on „ have we
no
how about the Teletubbies
shall I choose one
there we are
that's the WinniethePooh one
now you've got a matching set today „ haven't you
well that's the one you've got
no
have the WinniethePooh one now love because I've just put the toast on
or I tell you what
I'll do some toast and Marmalade and put it on
has he gone in the grass
oh yes
he's having a little sniff around „ isn't he
can you see his tail
it's all different shades of ginger
it's a very pretty tail „ isn't it
mind you he's a boy so I shouldn't call him pretty
but he is quite pretty
isn't Ginger
what as he got
nice
a nice nose
has he
nice to see you nose
would you like a little bit more drink
do you wanna wash and go
do you wanna sit on your potty for a few minutes
to watch the television
there you are
nice Teletubby plate for you
and I'll have the WinniethePooh plate
how does that sound
do you not want it Thomas
you've just had Cornflakes and grapes
you not going to be hungry later on
what about this apple
well I'll give you some more to drink because you haven't really had very much „ have you
Thursday
oh I thought you said you were thirsty
can you say the days of the week
but there's
Monday Tuesday Wednesday
so you've suddenly gone from telling me the days of the week to counting
you did pretty well with the days of the week „ didn't you
can you remember what we do on seven days of the week Thomas
wind the bobbin up
wind the bobbin up
wind the bobbin up
pull
clap clap
wind it back again
wind it back again
pull
clap clap
point to the ceiling
point to the floor
point to the floor
don't sing with your mouth in your cup
point to the window
point to the door
put your hands together
one two three
and place them gently on your knee
that's a silly thing to do
to sing into a beaker
because then we couldn't hear what you were saying
could we
you wanna do it
pull
clap
wind it back again
do you
you wanna get down and watch Michael
well Michael won't be on till a little bit later Thomas
children's programmes don't start till later on in the day „ do they
what will
what were we saying about poor Michael the other day
we were saying he seems to be on the television an awful lot „ doesn't he
he works a long time
actually Thomas do you know what I think he does
when you've got CBBC on choice they tend to repeat the same program
if you've watched Teletubbies in the morning then it's on again in the afternoon
it's exactly the same program „ isn't it
so I think he's not there quite as long as it seems
I would imagine that he's only there a short while during the day
and they just keep repeating it
but having said that he shows different cards inbetween each program „ doesn't he
so I think he might be there for a fair while in the morning
thirsty
you're thirsty „ are you
nothing to drink
well I'm going to have this toast because I'm hungry
is that alright
hm
does that taste good
you've not had blackcurrant juice for a while „ have you
we've been drinking orange
be careful love
who else is on your WinniethePooh mug
Tigger
and are there any bees
because usually where WinniethePooh is there's honey and some bees
can you see any
no
I can't
what about butterflys
I've got WinniethePooh and Piglet
and there are butterflys and leaves but I can't see any bees
mhm
do you think it's a windy day
oh look
WinniethePooh has got his hand in a jar of honey on your beaker „ hasn't he
Pooh and Piglet are walking on my plate
but on your beaker
don't do that Tom
don't put your hands in
they'll get sticky
but on yours WinniethePooh and Tigger are relaxing „ aren't they
mhm
what as WinniethePooh got in his picnic basket Thomas
can you see
grapes
he as got he as got a nice checked blanket „ hasn't he
do you think the blanket's to spread on the floor so they can sit down and have a lovely picnic
delicious
what's delicious
breakfast
would you like another drink
you want me to turn the television on and watch Michael
in a minute Thomas
what we'll do we'll have a little wash
a big wash
alright
and you can sit on your potty and we'll turn the television on
but we won't have the sound on
we'll just have a look at what's on and we can talk about it
but if we have the sound on full I can't tell what you're saying
you want the sound on you don't want me talking
oh dear
do you not like hearing what I've got to say
oh that's not nice „ is it
oh who's that
the who
the policeman
who
the postman
is that what you're trying to say
fireman
I hope not
we can do without the policemen and the firemen here this morning
that's all we need „ isn't it
do you think it's going to rain
it as gone really dark „ hasn't it
oh dear
I could do without it raining Thomas
do you remember a few weeks ago
or last week even
it was nice and hot „ wasn't it
and we had our meals outside
and do you remember the day we stopped in Didsbury for an ice cream
what do you mean nothing happened
then it started to rain
is it raining now
I wouldn't be surprised
it as gone very dark
I wanted to have a look at your little lego trains and things Thomas
did I wash your hands
I did „ didn't I
I don't think I dried them with a towel
I don't feel as if I've done a proper job today
no
when we go upstairs later you can have your teeth brushed
and we'll put some nice fresh clean clothes on
how does that sound
and sweeties
no
perhaps you'll get sweeties later
do Nana and Granddad give you sweeties
do they say you've been a good boy and give you sweeties
look
we've been talking about WinniethePooh characters this morning
we've got all this little ones from Macdonalds „ haven't we
let me just nip upstairs and get that WinniethePooh book and then we can
because I can't work out who's who Thomas
where did we leave them last time
have you
you've taken Eeyore's hat off
yes
you got those with happy meals „ didn't you
they've probably stopped doing it now
we haven't been to Macdonalds for a while
we went just before your birthday and then we went the day after Mummy's birthday
I don't think WinniethePooh ever did go boing boing „ did he
it's the kangaroo that goes boing
kangaroo goes boing
this little on his hat lights up
I don't think Eeyore does anything „ does he
don't think Eeyore does anything
there
let's have a look
you press his hat there
press at the top of his hat and his hat lights up
I don't think WinniethePooh does anything either
oh no this is Tigger „ isn't it
oh yes
Tigger goes boing boing
boing boing
what was that
boing boing
I think Tigger goes boing boing and you can swap his hat
you can take his hat on and off „ can't you
with Eeyore
and what does WinniethePooh do
I'd be surprised if Winnie doesn't do anything
I don't think he does
look
we've got a book here „ haven't we
WinniethePooh and his friends
WinniethePooh
oh look
there's lotsof bees on this picture
here is WinniethePooh
who is very fond of eating honey
one day Pooh hears a loud buzzing noise
that buzzing noise means there are bees says Pooh
and bees make honey so that I can eat it
then Pooh rolls in the mud until he is black all over
can you see how dirty he is
Pooh was pretending to be a small black cloud
he floats up into the sky on a blue balloon
but Pooh cannot reach the honey
hey that's funny
we've got a story about balloons again
but what color is the balloon this time
and what color was the balloon last time
no
not red
what's the story about the little boy who went to bed
and went up the man on the moon
went up to the man in the moon
what color was his balloon
yellow
some of the bees fly round the cloud
yes
I can hear Tigger boinging
some of the fleas
the fleas
some of the bees fly around the cloud
ChristopherRobin puts up his umbrella
he pretends it is raining
ow
cries Pooh as he comes down with a bump
isn't it funny how a bear likes honey
right
who's this now
Eeyore
is this Eeyore
Eeyore as got a pretty pink ribbon
on his tail
Eeyore is an old grey donkey
today he is rather say
don't do that Tom

we're going to find out in a minute
don't
look
Pooh bear says what has happened to your tail says Pooh
it isn't there
oh Eeyore has lost his tail
I will find your tail for you says Pooh
Pooh is sure Owl can help find Eeyore's tail
he goes to Owl's house
there is Eeyore's tail
what's it doing up there
it's hanging on the branch of the tree „ isn't it
Pooh carries the tail back to Eeyore
ChristopherRobin puts it back in the right place
there we are
Eeyore is very happy
look
does your Eeyore have a tail on it
oh no
you mustn't pull it off
can you remember what we did at your birthday party
Mummy's just going to have another mouthful of toast
would you like some toast
would you like me to feed you and then you don't get your fingers sticky
because you can't play with these if you've got sticky fingers
well shall we move the toys out of the way
alright
please
come on
you have a mouthful of this toast
oh that's nice
we sharing
no
at your birthday party instead of having PinTheTailOnTheDonkey we had PinTheTailOnTheEeyore „ didn't we
and who won the prize for getting the tail nearest
I don't think it was Ben „ was it
Charlotte won a prize for getting it almost there
but who got it nearly spot on
you nearly did it
well you had it right into the sky „ didn't you
no
we went to see her on Monday
what's the name of the little girl that won the prize
Emma
no
Rachel
remember going to Rachel's house
right
we'll go on to Piglet
we haven't got a Piglet
we'll tell Daddy we've got to go back to Macdonalds to see if they've got a piglet
would you like another bite of toast
there you are
I wonder if you can buy them
perhaps we could buy a Piglet
Piglet is a very small animal
he does not like having a bath
do you remember the story book we've got about the pig that doesn't like having a bath
what's he called
Scruffy pig
do you remember Scruffy pig
he gets in the shower and he keeps the umbrella up „ doesn't he
so the water doesn't hit him
Piglet is a very small animal
he does not like having a bath
one day Piglet and his friends Pooh and Rabbit meet Kanga and BabyRoo
right
have we got Kanga
this is Kanga
here we are
right
we've had a story about WinniethePooh
we've had a story about Eeyore
there's Winnie
there's Eeyore
we haven't got a piglet so we can't we can't put a Piglet in the line
but we can put Kanga there „ can't we
one day Piglet and his friends Pooh and Rabbit meet Kanga and BabyRoo
we've not got the rabbit either „ have we
you enjoy this toast
Piglet and Pooh help Rabbit make a plan
Rabbit wants Piglet to pretend to be BabyRoo
when Kanga finds Piglet in her pocket she decides to give him a bath
she scrubs him firmly
she rubs him dry
poor Piglet doesn't wanna be clean
he gets all dirty again
do you remember on the first page WinniethePooh was rolling „ wasn't he
it says Pooh was rolling in the mud until he was black all over
and on this one we've got Piglet that doesn't wanna be clean
so he gets dirty
don't you think that was funny
don't you think that was funny
that they pretend Piglet is the baby kangaroo and put him in his Mummy's pouch
so she thinks it's her baby and she gives him a bath
but poor Piglet wasn't very pleased
right
now this is a story about Kanga and BabyRoo
Kanga is BabyRoo's mother
she carries Roo in her pocket
it's called a pouch
look
can you see in her tummy
Kanga is very busy looking after BabyRoo
Roo makes friends with Tigger
one day Kanga gives Roo and Tigger a picnic
don't get into mischief she calls
but Roo and Tigger climb a tree
I hope they're not going to get dirty again
like the other two
we can't get down cries Roo
isn't it fun
Pooh and Piglet and ChristoperRobin help them get down
come on Tigger calls Pooh
it's easy
well it is for Tigger „ isn't it
because he can bouncy
Rabbit
we haven't got a Rabbit
Rabbit likes to be busy
one morning Rabbit wakes up early
he thinks he will go and visit a friend
he knocks at ChristopherRobin's door
hello it's Rabbit he calls
ChristoperRobin is not there
Rabbit sees a piece of paper on the ground
it is a message from ChristopherRobin
gone out
back soon
busy
back soon
see ya

if you grow up to write like this at school your teachers will say oh ThomasHenry
gone out
gone isn't spelt right
backsonq instead of back soon
busy
that's spelt wrong
are you busy sometimes
when we got out are we busy
and he as written back soon again
see ya
ChristopherRobin
Rabbit knows how to read
but where is ChristopherRobin
Rabbit asks Owl
Rabbit asks Pooh
Rabbit asks Eeyore
and Eeyore knows
ChristoperRobin is at school
he is learning how to read and write
oh that's a relief „ isn't it
little boy's at school
ChristopherRobin as gone to school so hopefully the next time he leaves a message he'll be able to spell a little bit better then he does at the moment
we haven't got an Owl either „ have we
an Owl or a Rabbit or a Piglet
no wonder Macdonalds decided to promote this
they've got a lot of characters to get through
Owl
Owl's house is in a tree
what can we see on the tree
Piglet
is that Eeyore's tail
excuse me
it's what
it's caught up
it is
