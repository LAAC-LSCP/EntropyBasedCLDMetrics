I don't think it's coming here
it's parked across our drive
I'm not expecting it
oh yeah
that's funny cause it's like a number six
but it's on it's side „ isn't it
I don't think it even says on the lorry
here's the man coming with a box that says fragileq

and I recognize the writing
I think it's from my friend Sharon

it doesn't say Thomas on the envelope
but it might do inside

pardon
hun
are you abbreviating everything this morning
and you're going to say hun
when you mean honey nut loops
right
have a seat at the table please
okay

don't call me an old girlie



put them back in the box
sit down first Thomas
sit in the box
sit in the box
sit in your chair
and remember what you pour you eat
so if you pour a lot
you've got to sit there until you're finished

so don't pour too many
you're better to start with a few
no
if you start with one you'll be here all day
right
let me put a
Chinese foot burn
you rubbed your foot between the chair „ did you
oh go on start with a few more than those
no
no
you don't touch with your fingers
put some more in the bowl
right
well I'm going away again if you don't behave
well pour some more
be sensible
you need more than four
pop the lid back on please
and that's the end of my cereal
five boxes empty now
look
I've got something different „ haven't I
right
would you like milk on those Thomas
what do you say
what do you say
that's better
don't be naughty this morning Thomas
careful
right
a drink
have it in this beaker this morning
now I've got two jobs to do today
we've got to hand some washing out
well alright
we've got four jobs then
I've got to do some work in the house
we've got to play
there you are
we've got to peg some washing out
while the weather's nice
and we must remember to put the rubbish out
for the dustmen
must have a lie out there
pardon

is lying down one of the jobs
I see
it actually looks a little bit dull at the front then „ doesn't it
yeah it looks nice at the back
luckily that's where the washing line is
oh we're eating our breakfast nicely
going to be some crunching and chumping „ isn't there

I'm just laughing because you've got your lego train on the table
look at the train driver
actually I think he's a farmer really
from the tractor „ isn't he
and he looks funny sitting on top of the train
watching you eating your breakfast
is that the cab
is that the way you built it
I notice he's got flashing lights at the front
like a police car
so what is he
a goods train
lights at the back at the bottom
hm
so why has he got flashing lights
to warn people that the goods train's coming
and it's a very loud and long train
one's noisy and one's quick
right
noisy noisy quick
is that what it says as it goes along
oh
mhm oh
that is fast
isn't it
pardon
luckily the goods are indoors
what do you mean
inside the train
and what sort of good does he carry
fruit
mhm

is that apples and pears
does it
ah is that why he's a farmer train driver
it's just that I thought you know fruit's grown in orchards
and farms
so I thought perhaps he'd brought his fruit
loaded it up in the train
and then driving it himself
so he is a farmer train driver
no
right
is that somebody working at the station
what
not when it's got milk all over it
cause if you get milk on the lego
I'll hafta wash it all
because milk will go really sour and horrible
no
you won't lick it off
you just don't put it on
I don't think either of us can talk properly
because we're both chomping away „ aren't we
does it taste good
no
Thomas
that's not how a train driver drinks
you've put your tongue in your beaker „ haven't you
and you're trying to lap your juice up
but you know what'll happen
it'll end up getting spilt
and look at the table
what's on the table
all the ironing that Mummy did last night
all beautifully folded up ready to go in the drawers
cause I couldn't come in last night
because you were asleep and Daddy was asleep
if I'd started putting clothes away in drawers
it would have woken you both up
so we don't want any spills this morning
because I haven't had a chance to move it
I wouldn't be very happy if I hadta rewash your
in fact do you know why I hadta put the washing machine on this morning
we've got some washing to peg out on the line later
cause in the washing machine
I've got some things in that are in it's called prewash Thomas
when things are very dirty
sometimes you put them in the washing machine
for what's called the prewash
with a little bit of powder
and it gives them a quick wash
and then lets them stand in water to soak
to soak stains away
and then when I drain that water
I'll put them in on a proper wash
can you guess what's in the washing machine
what was stained
pardon
the pen jumper
that's right
you got pen or biro „ didn't you
all over your shirt yesterday
then what happened to your vest
you spilt something on it
was it Ribena
you ran outside in the wet
and your socks got muddy
you slipped on the grass
so your trousers were dirty
but then I didn't tell you this
last night after I'd done my ironing
because Daddy had put a couple of things on the video recorder
that I wanted to watch
so when you went to bed last night
I stood and I ironed all these clothes
and then when I finished ironing
I went up stairs
had a quick shower
got into my night dress
came down
put the second video on
well the second program I wanted to watch
sat down with a cup of coffee to relax
and guess what I did
dropped the coffee
it went all in the chair
and all over my nightie
so I ended up going back to have a quick shower again
and putting a clean night dress on
and then cleaning the chair
and guess where the night dress is
soaking with all your dirty things in the washing machine

no
I don't think you will
so it's a good job really
because that prewash
no
you won't
no
it was a pen actually from church „ wasn't it
that you got
I think that you just suddenly appeared with three biros
in your pocket
whose pens were they
who have you been pinching pens from
hm
seems a bit careless
that somebody's left three biros on the floor
two pens and one biro
well a biro is a pen
the blue one hm
well yes
I noticed that your shirt had both black and blue marks on it
no
I told you not to get pen on your clothes Thomas
because it might not come out
well I knew it was all biro or pen
but no
that was your best shirt yesterday Thomas
and you've only worn it once before yesterday
so I hope the marks come out
cause if they don't
no
there's no try and clean them Tom
if they don't come out that's it
and when you next needta be smart somewhere
you'll hafta go in a shirt with biro all over
they'll all say
sillybilly boy

your shirt tomorrow
hm
I hope we don't find that
mind you Daddy sometimes puts biros in his shirt pockets
and he gets little bit of biro on his shirt
mucky you
yes dirtyberties
I haven't seen Purdie covered in biro and I never wanna
don't ever try and draw on Purdie „ will you
no
she's brushed up against paint before
you know when paint's wet
you've seen people put up caution wet paint signs
or they just say wet paint do not touch
Purdie can't read
I've forgotten where it was from
because I think we'd been doing some painting
not here
when but the place that we lived at before here
I think we were really worried about Purdie
but nothing happened to her
then one of the neighbors must have been doing some painting
Purdie walked and past and came in with paint all down her side
well not really because
hm well
luckily with her being a long haired cat
I cut it off

you've not been sitting down a long time
you've just sat down
it'll be the way you're sitting
you mean it's stiff
sore
or is it just stuck to the chair
because that can be painful „ can't it
when you stick to the chair
well no
the problem is with pussy cat
she cats clean themselves
yeah
so if you're covered in paint
and you lick it off
what's going to happen
the paint's going to go in your mouth
and paint is poisonous
so I hadta stop her licking it off
a lot of paint doesn't just wash off
although actually I think this did
so what I did
we held her down
got scissors and cut off as much as we could
and then we bathed her
which she didn't like
but at least it stopped her from licking the paint
I think if a cat's very badly covered in paint
you know if say a paint pot falls on their head or something
I think you hafta go to the vets really
to get them sorted out
unless it's a paint that you can just wash off in the shower
but cats don't like water
the trouble is because Purdie's old
if we hadta give her a bath now
she'd probably get very upset
and that in itself might make her poorly
well no
it's okay to bath them
but they absolutely hate it
I have bathed her on several occasions
sometimes when she's come in very dirty
the thing is now
Thomas
stop it
no
she's I know she's elderly or olderly
what do you say
well that's not a word
elderly is a word
and old is the word
no
well olderlyq s your own little word
but it's quite cute
olderly
no
Purdie doesn't explore quite as much now „ does she
oh I'm sure she still chases mice
I think she would
but the only thing is we haven't got mice round here
thank goodness
although again I'm sure we have mice
we have
because I've seen one in the sweet peas last year
definitely saw a mouse
in fact we've had one since then
but what I mean is
I haven't actually seen Purdie with a mouse but
when you were a baby
one day Purdie had a mouse
just outside of this door

and I remember you were in your little rocker top thing
and I picked you up and put you on the table
and then I stood on the table
then I rang Linda next door
and I said oh Purdie's got a mouse
and she said well I can't help you
and Linda and I were talking to each other
through the patio door
because the conservatory wasn't built in those days
we were talking to each other through the patio door
and we were watching Purdie with this mouse
and eventually
I managed to grab hold of Purdie
so that the mouse had time to run away from her
but it's not as
oh Purdie wasn't happy with me
but the thing is I don't like mice
but it was a little field mouse
it wasn't as if it was in the house
and Purdie's not a hungry animal
and the reason animals kill other animals is for food
to eat them
you know cats kill mice to eat them
but Purdie has loads of food
she doesn't needta kill a mouse to eat it
and it's not fair
poor little mouse
imagine how frightened it must have been
while she was tossing it in the air
and she was having fun
it was like Tom and Jerry
she thought it was great
chasing this poor little thing
so I held onto her
while the mouse ran away
and do you know what else she's had
well she's had birds
I've seen her with birds
and frogs
we've got frogs in our garden
have you seen them
you know where they are
near your sand pit
that's right
you did the other week
hm you would do
it was quite funny
because again when you were very young
we went to Nana and Grandad's
and collected some pebbles
oh don't you like stories from when I was young


you just don't like the sound of my voice „ do you
cheeky boy
you cheeky boy
oh no
don't do that
right
this is the last story now
then I'm keeping quiet and you talk the rest of the time
the rest of the day is yours
right
here we go again
when you were a when you were very young
we went to the seaside
and we collected a pot of stones and pebbles
and oh you were very young
but you useta like sitting on the floor
just messing about with these pebbles outside
and then of course the Summer went
and the pebbles were outside in a plastic container
and I think it rained and it rained in them
and I looked at the container and thought it was all dirty water
I thought oh well I'll clean it up one day
we don't need them now
the next time I looked we had a little family of frogs
that had sort of made a home in this box
with the water and the pebbles
so we left it and that's where they are
and the box is still there
the pebbles are still there
and the frogs are still there
did you know that white butterfly
I can just see a white butterfly
it's nice „ isn't it
was it
hm
oh here we go again
telling me stories about the past
ah ha ha
oh I'm bored with that
oh listened to that yesterday
what
Thomas it's not a butterfly
it's a butterfly
it's not a smellywotter
it's a butterfly
what's a
no
what's our favorite story about a butterfly
well what is it before it's a butterfly
you do not hate that one very

a very hungry caterpillar
hm I'm glad we didn't hafta have that again and again
I'm going to tell you another story now
about when you were a baby
instead of saying again
because when you were
the teletubbies started on the television
when you were a baby
and I started
the first time I saw it you were about six months old
I didn't know who the teletubbies were
and now we're useta the teletubbies saying again
again
but in those days we weren't
because we didn't really watch it
when you wanted to do something again
you know what you useta say
no
you didn't
a do
a do
a do
when you were oh again very small
we went on holiday with Nan and Grandad

and we put you in every evening
after tea we went to the local playground
oh don't do that Thomas
and there was a little swing
with a proper baby seat on
not like the swing we've got now
a proper baby seat
and Nana and Grandad useta put you in there
and we useta push you very gently
and when the swing was slowing down
you'd say a a do
Nana and Grandad would take you to JohnLewis
and you useta like riding
well you still like doing this
going up the escalator right to the top
and then all the way down to the bottom
having a quick look in the toy store in the basement
and then back up to the top
and you'd get to the escalator
and go a a do
you wanted to do it again and again
we gave
we gave you a chocolate mousse one day
after your lunch
and when you'd finished it you wanted another one
and you pointed and went a do
oh what a funny baby we had
you were absolutely gorgeous
you're still absolutely gorgeous
it's just
you're a doer
just you don't like listening now
to stories of the olden days
when you were a baby

olden days when you were a little baby
we were old fashioned in those days yes
just think there was a time when you couldn't walk Thomas

well that was nice
oh no
it wasn't in a way
when you couldn't walk
no
I hadta carry you every where
or put you in the pram
and then when you could walk it was good
but oh the time when you're just learning to walk
it's so worrying for Mummies and Daddies because
you've seen babies „ haven't you
just start to walk and then what happens
fall over
so all the time you've got to watch them and help them
crawling's difficult
cause by gum babies can crawl fast
and one minute they're there and the next they've gone
you know the lady that's written to us this morning
hm
yes
well you know the lady that's written to Mummy this morning
Sharon
well
again
when you were a baby

we had another party
you see these people
Mummy's friends
AuntyMonica AuntySharon AuntySandra AuntyAnne
and Mummy
all five of us went absolutely everywhere together
while we were at school
and we still are all in touch
and if something happens to one of us
the other four all go
and we all live in different parts of the country
cause AuntySharon now lives in Devon
AuntyAnne is in Canada at the moment
pardon
where Kiera is
yes you are quite right
KieraSmith's Nana and Grandad live in Canada
their Daddy's from Canada „ isn't he
he's Canadian
AuntyMonica's in New York
AuntySandra is in Lincoln
I do
he's going to France
is he
that's very nice
that's where Neil went to
Neil goes to France every year
I like France
nice and warm there Thomas
nice and sunny
guess what I said when you said I know Nathan
I do

a bit like a do I said I do
I I I do know Nathan
so anyway getting back to the story
this is a good story
this one
when you were a
Thomas
Thomas
no
come on

are you having fun
because I don't want you being rude
that's very rude
you forgot to say please when you had your cereal
and you forgot to say pardon when you did that
no
right
I'm going to carry on with this story now
we went for a party
one sunday when you were a baby
listen
AuntySandra had Philip
her little boy's a little bit older than you
and she was expecting Rebecca
Rebecca was a big bump in her tummy
and they hadn't seen you
so we took
oh no
Sharon and Monica had seen you
but the others hadn't
we took you over
and it was Summer
and we went to AuntyMonica's house
and she had a wooden floor
and we were having our lunch
and you were just sort of sitting on the floor
and the next thing
off you went
you were trying your best to walk
and you couldn't
but by gum you could crawl around
and it was so funny having this wooden floor
we could hear you all the way
and then you kept pulling yourself up
they had a writing bureau like we have
you kept pulling yourself up on that
and pulling the little knobs and the drawers and ah
it was a lovely party but
all the time I hadta watch you
every second
and everybody else was sitting round thinking it was really funny
because you were just such hard work
just
we were having lunch
and we could hear
that's Thomas off again
and we'd say no you don't come back
bring you back into the room
put you on the floor then
before I'd even sat down
you were at the other end of the room
it's alright you laughing
you wait lad til you're a man and I'm an old lady
by gum I shall do some things to you
that's Thomas crawling across a wooden floor
and do you know what I shall do
just crawl across the floor
when we got to the other end
you sat and went ha
you laughed like you're laughing
you know your laugh hasn't changed Thomas
when we watch videos of when you were a baby
your laugh is exactly the same
and you useta just sit
with this wonderful look on your face
laughing
because you knew very well that you were causing trouble
right
no more stories of the olden days
olden days „ aren't they
oldeny days
now there's a
Thomas
will you please stop doing that
now listen
that's something else
was a burp that lives in a boat
well I'll tell you what
when you first learnt to talk you were always polite
that was something good about the old days
you
right
come on

right
I shall have a tablet now
and then
no

oh now that was silly „ wasn't it
mind you don't bump your head
right
now
listen
I'm going to
I was going to try something now
but I don't know whether this'll work
when we first started doing these tapes
I remember being told that we could make the tape outside
if we wanted
and I said what about the noise
so what we'll do
we'll try and hang this washing out outside
with microphones
but if there's somebody talking outside
or somebody cutting the grass
or doing something noisy
then we'll hafta
well we can still hang the washing out
but we'll hafta stop the tape
and do something else
hold on Tom
I needta set up first
forty one I was going to say
Thomas
that will do
don't be rude
I don't like you being a rude boy
you're only jealous
only jealous because I've got a big bottom
aren't you
I know she has
and that's it you see
because if she's a good cook
she'll try everything she eats Thomas
she's a nice lady „ isn't she
no
I said is she a nice lady
it doesn't matter how big her bottom is
what
well it doesn't matter how fat your bottom is
as long as you're a nice person
I can think of worse things than having a fat bottom Thomas
can't you
now
stop that please
are we playing banks today
well we'll try and get this washing out „ shall we
well no
I don't mean to play that outside
you just have a few minutes outside
while I peg these clothes out
come on
because it's fairly quiet at the moment
if we leave it much later
then people will start doing things outside
Tom could you get the pegs for me please
just inside the door
hello Purdie
look
we've got Purdie here as well
Purdie likes helping with these things „ doesn't she
do you
listen Thomas
I just
well you had your tractor somewhere
where's the tractor
is it in the shed
because last year you helped me hang all this washing out
with the tractor and trailer
but I don't know where it is
no
we can't get in it's locked
hm
the orange shed
but the tractor's in here
no
don't open
is it in that one
yeah
oh what
the one behind this one
no
is it this first one
oh and the other one's the one I can't get into
that's obviously why
when Daddy comes home tonight we'll ask him
well I know the washing will be dry
but we've got more washing to do on „ haven't we
no
she's not
poor thing
are you
are you
don't lie on the grass Thomas
because it's still not very dry
no
because you've just got clean clothes on
if you play and you fall over
but don't just lie down on purpose
look
there's a little bit of green fern there
that you played in yesterday
can you see
over there
look
well that's a trail left by a slug
what
the slug
oh the
just behind your legs
well you've turned round now
look
look straight ahead
there you are
you played with that yesterday
on your swing
right
you're going to do a bit of swinging „ are you now
can you heat the swing
right
I'll just put that
Thomas
stop it please
well he hasn't gone to work so early
he always goes to work at this time
he hasta get to work on time Thomas
if you don't go to work on time
you don't keep your job
and if you don't keep your job you don't get paid
and if you don't get paid you have no money
you hafta go to work
look
can you see your pyjamas now
what are they
Buzz lightyear
you didn't wee in them
when
oh that was trousers
that wasn't pyjamas „ was it
well I know but you get upset „ didn't you
that's what happened
I think you got yourself into a state over it „ didn't you
yes
yeah but most of the time Tom you are tired
it's when you start saying I'm not tired
that we actually know you are
oh
I thought Purdie was going to have a swim then „ did you
she is
where the fox lives
oh frogs
well yes
the frogs were more in that corner there
yes
I don't think Purdie would lie where it was damp
I don't think Purdie would lie anywhere where it was damp „ do you
no
I think she prefers to be nice and dry
you haven't got to lie where the frogs went
it's really damp
your tee shirt's pretty much the same color as the sky Thomas
can you
oh yes I can hear it yes
yes I can see it now
I think it's quite a noisy one though „ isn't it
I think that's going in to land
it's coming down


so it's too low to see
it just looked like a silvery plane
from where I was
a golden plane
the swing's a bit squeaky Tom

I might have to squirt it
might make it
ho
oh be careful Thomas
I think you should
what about that little pair of sandals
what about that little pair of sandals
they're not yucky at all
well I believe that because the ground's a bit wet
well you have
you've got Buzz lightyear pyjamas with long sleeves
and long trousers
and you've got Buzz lightyear
shorts and tee shirt
I think we'll hafta
now because there are other people talking „ aren't there
I'm just going to go inside
what's hard
what's hard love
is it
well it's a long time since I've been outside
apart from that
do you remember that little playground we go to sometimes
and the parks
miles away from anybody
and I go on that slide „ don't I
and the swings
because nobody can see me
but
well you can go on all the time
because you're a child
but Mummy shouldn't because I'm too big
but I go on that

you look really nice in your lime green tee shirt Thomas
nice and bright „ isn't it
course I like you
yes
you've twirled the straps round „ haven't you
is it
you're have a sort of twirly swing „ aren't you
before you actually swing backwards and forwards
it's twirling round
yes
yes well it's moved to you now
I turned it up a minute ago
because there was somebody else talking
and then
put it back on
I can move back a little bit

yes
well the thing is at this time of year
there are planes all the time „ aren't there
going all different places
so it's very hard to catch a time when there isn't a plane

they won't all be going on holiday
you see some planes carry supplies „ don't they
you know like your goods trains
well that's what some planes are for
for carrying things
trains
yes they do
yes
that's right
well sometimes planes do use
very poorly people around
you know to hospitals
I mean helicopters are often used
when people have accidents „ aren't they
and then the police
not the police the
the squirrel
that's right
squirrel's a police helicopter
but there's sort of an ambulance helicopter
I've forgotten what it's called
when the people have have accidents
often the helicopter takes them „ doesn't it to hospital
yes
what the air ambulance
that's it's called
out
sometimes I think I'm
ambulance aeroplanes „ don't they
animals
they go sometimes in aeroplanes
you alright
moved your slide now
oh Thomas don't move that
be careful with that
I do love you yes
why do you keep asking if I love you
do you feel very unloved
well where can I put it
I'll put it on top of the washing line
I'll put it there
you sail just there do you
we're going in a minute
leave this stuff
no
I can't because the clothes will block the sound
if I put it in the middle
then the microphone's not going to be able to pick up any sound
because the clothes will drown out all the sound „ won't they
I think we'd better go inside
this is the last thing I'm hanging up
this sheet
well where do you suggest
suggest
suggest on the sand pit
but then we might get the noise of Purdie
because she's asleep just by the sand pit
look
she does sometimes
yes
where are you sailing to
are you
it could
it's the cover for the washing line
yes I think I'm going to fold it up
because if this gets damaged
I won't be able to protect the washing line „ will I
no
I don't
have you
are you expecting to find
Doodles
what pink toy „ you mean
oh well he must be a boy then „ mustn't he
pardon
you like squirrels
I haven't seen a squirrel for a long time
oh the squirrel helicopter
I thought you were talking about squirrels in the garden
that gathered nuts
have you
have you
did you
did it
are you coming to sit next to me properly now
look at us today
we're in bright colors „ aren't we
what are you wearing
green and blue
blue shorts and a lime green top
and what am I wearing
pink shorts and a white top
yes please
and guess what Purdie's wearing again
oh listen
can you hear the church clock
do you think that's ten o'clock or eleven o'clock
yes
okay
alright
okay
you're selling the partnership
that's fine
is the hose pipe the anchor
right
okay
man aboard
man deboard
what's that mean
come aboard
right
climb aboard
you're in

does he
that's something you
that's something you shout when something's falling
timber
I can hear somebody with a hose pipe
do you think they're filling a paddling pool
that sounds good „ doesn't it
yes
I useta have one when I was little
well I think it'll have long gone since I had it Thomas
I think it will only be thrown away now
because it's a long time since I was a child
can you
there's a lot of noise now
is something going past on the road
there's water
what music can you hear
can't actually tell what it is though
it's just a beat we can hear „ isn't it
do you know one of the things
I'm going back to the really olden days now
when I was a little girl
one of the things that I useta like Thomas
some of my friends had a big garden
and their Daddy useta have a water sprinkler in the middle of the lawn
and on a hot day he would turn it on really fast
and we useta put our swimming costumes on
and we'd run through it
and it was lovely
listen
with us getting the washing out so early Thomas
if it dries
then we can play with your water gun later on
we can play with the water gun later on
you can't play with it when I've got washing on the line
well later on if the washing's dry
and I've got it in
yes
as long as you promise not to squirt Purdie
or put it over the fences either side
because Linda and Brian and Fred and Rachel
don't wanna get wet „ do they
okay
right
yes
you've just brought a leaf to me from one of the bushes
that's a nice leaf
what is it sposta be
your ticket
oh I see
so
man aboard
no Thomas
don't throw bits of ripped up leaves on the lawn
Daddy'll get cross
because he's got to sweep
don't you
thank you
do I need it then
to get on board your pirate ship
right
right
is that the slot
the slots in the bench can be the ticket machine
look
that's good „ isn't it
oh
yes
we're all ready
yes
are you trying to do a knot with the hose pipe
pretending it's the anchor
tying it round the swing
that's good
well not quite
yes that sounds right
that's right actually Thomas
no that's a different noise now
it's nearly
if you'd have pulled the other end that would have been a knot
what noise do you think that is now
somebody cutting the grass
oh yes
if it was a plane it would be a big one „ wouldn't it
it sounds a lot closer than a plane
that's right
put it through there
and then pull the end tight
you needta do it nearer the top I think
okay
I'm sure it's fine

right
and that's the plane yes
there's a
we needta turn the tape off really
I think we've got to be a bit careful now Thomas
because there's a lot of noise outside
there's more and more people going out
with it being a nice day
you know we've got a little girl behind
I think her Mummy's filling the paddling pool
we've got somebody cutting the grass
UncleBrian is outside banging in the garden
lotsof jumbo jets and lotsof noise
so I think really we'll hafta come in
and apart from that I don't think other people will be very happy
if they thought what they were saying was being taped „ do you
I think we've got to be a bit careful
it's alright you and I talking
but you know you don't want other people's conversations
because they wouldn't be very pleased „ would they
if that was on tape
yes
we'll play inside in a moment yes
okay then
that's fine
of course I can yes
yes that's right
we needta close the door
what's the matter
yes well that's it
yes it will get noisy soon
we can't because people can't hear what you're saying

as I say I really don't think other people would be very happy
if they thought we were listening to their conversation „ do you
