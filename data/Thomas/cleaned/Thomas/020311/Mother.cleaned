shall we feed Purdie
feed Purdie

the food
do you think she'd like some fresh food
a clean plate and some fresh food
what's Bow doing
she's waiting for breakfast
oh yes
she's rubbing her head on the side of the cupboard
she always rubs her face on something when she wants feeding
oh you're doing it now „ are you
oh she hit her head but she didn't bang it
she just gently rubbed it
yes
yes
is that what she looked like she was saying yes
because she was burying her head
there we are
that's Purdie fed

the mixer around
would you like some more toast Thomas
no
you're not having Smarties
cherries
you'd like some cherries
cherries in there
do you mean the cherries are in the fridge or you wanna put the cherries in your tray
yes
well I'll wash some cherries for you
Grandma and Granddad
what's the matter
Nana and Granddad
they're not here yet „ are they
no
they're not here
yes
Nana and Granddad are coming
but they're not here yet
what are you trying to tell me
that someone's trying to put something through a letterbox on a white door
you call all letterboxes yellow boxes „ don't you
because they're gold colored
yes
a big bang
well I don't know what the big bang is
is somebody just shut a door
I can see Sue's white front door
but I didn't see a man standing at it
you're obviously telling me about a man in a big truck „ aren't you
but I can't see anything out of the window
was it something you were looking at when Mummy went upstairs
there we are
where would you like the cherries
in there
in the back of the train
would you like some strawberries as well
strawberries as well
Mummy's going to have something to eat in a minute
cherries
Mummy will have something to eat and then we better think about getting dressed „ hadn't we
you always eat cherries quicker than I can stem them Thomas
don't you
I think you're probably talking about our front door because the other day when we went for a walk you insisted when we came back that we posted some letters through our front door
and then when we opened the door picked up the letters from the doormat and then you made me shut it again so you could post them back again and we did that over and over again
is that what you're thinking of
we banged the door shut and then you could post the letters again through the yellow box
a big bang
did you bang the front door
you banged it shut
no
Purdie's not outside
oh yes
she's there at the door
she wants to go out „ doesn't she
there we are
right
shall I cut up some strawberries as well
would you like that

I don't think she wants to go really Thomas
she just wants to stand and look at the door „ doesn't she
oops a daisy
yes
Mummy as just dropped the lid of the juice into the washing up bowl
there we are
I've put the lid back on the jug now
you'd like some more
I'm going to cut up some cherries now
no
I'm not
I'm going to cut up some strawberries
Mummy's a bit confused this morning „ isn't she
yes
yes
I'm glad you knew they were strawberries because I said they were cherries
yes
yes Thomas
yes
Sue's door has got a
well they're all gold colored „ aren't they
the letterboxes
Sue much
you like Sue very much
no
what are you saying
there you are
another one
yes
I could hear a train then as well
that's because we've got the patio door open so that Purdie could go out
she as gone now and she's sitting on the mat
look
I don't think she's watching the train
I don't think she can see it from there
I think Mummy's going to have some toast now Thomas
have you had enough toast
no
would you like some more toast
yes please
there's your toast
look
from before
it as got some jam on it „ hasn't it
you've had some Cornflakes and some toast with jam and some cheese and some cherries
and now you're eating strawberries
it's quite a big breakfast „ isn't it
not nice
are you telling me the strawberries not nice
but you're eating them „ aren't you
are you telling me they're not nice
but you're still going ahead and eating them
these aren't for now
Mummy's just getting two beakers of juice ready for later on
getting them ready and going to put them in the fridge
so that later on when you want some juice it's all ready
yes
yes
that's the noise of the air coming out „ isn't it

noise of the air
we'll put them in the fridge
and the toaster's making a noise now „ isn't it
it's the toaster toasting the bread
I don't know why it was making a noise
would you like some more cheese
was that the noise it was making
it's a silly noise „ isn't it
yes

would you like some more cheese
yes
I'll pour myself a cup of tea now
NinNin's tea's coming
baby tea coming
what do you mean baby tea coming
you've got some orange juice „ haven't you
well you can have a sip of Mummy's tea but it'll hafta be a lot later on when it's cool
but I don't know what you mean by baby tea
are you a baby
or a big boy
a big boy
and what's your name
Thomas
what is it
Thomas
Thomas Lastname
baby Lastname
what about Thomas Lastname


excuse me
Mummy's blowing her nose
did you say Hall then
sore knee
oh I think it's nearly better now „ isn't it

oh you're just pretending to cry like you did when you first hurt it
so your name is Thomas Lastname
is Purdie called Purdie Lastname
no
and what about Daddy
is Daddy called Peter
and is Mummy called Jean
and is Grandma called Jean
Grandma Jean
no
Granddad Leonard
and then we've got Grandma Daisy
and Granddad Irwin
but as long as your name is Thomas that's all I'm bothered about
you're Thomas Lastname
I wondered why you weren't singing it very clearly but you were actually eating a piece of toast while you were singing
were you singing Baa baa black sheep
three bags full
you were singing that song outside the other day „ weren't you
and you were singing it all the way through
you said
one for the Master and one for the Dame
and one for the little boy who lives down the lane
yes
you've put the horse on top of the train
and the driver's driving
and it's carrying strawberries around in the back
oh no
don't keep bobbing your head like Purdie did
has Mummy got to go to work today
pardon
oh shortbread
yes
that probably means Grandma and Granddad are coming
and they'll be taking you up to JohnLewis „ won't they
to the shop
and they usually go into the restaurant and have a cup of tea and you have some milk and you have a shortbread biscuit „ don't you
I think they're going to B Q as well today

I'm sorry about that
hm why do you keep eating them if they're not nice
oh Granddad's cream on your sore knee
yes

it must be quite windy as well today because your swing is swinging backwards and forwards
there's nobody on it so it must be the breeze blowing it
the breeze blowing it
it's certainly much cooler today „ isn't it
with not a lot of sunshine outside it looks a bit dull
mind you
Mummy as got to go to work today so Mummy doesn't mind too much if it's dull
but it's a shame for you and Grandma and Granddad because if it doesn't get that nice
you won't be happy in the garden
and if it doesn't rain that doesn't matter „ does it
you can still play out as long as it's warm
yes
if it's raining again you can't go out „ can you
