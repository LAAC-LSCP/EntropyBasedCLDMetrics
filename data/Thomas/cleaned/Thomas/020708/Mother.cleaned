look
one spoon in that cup and one spoon in that cup
and usually we put sugar in after the tea's made but we haven't made the tea yet

oh heck
oh heck
are you alright

the man's drinking his tea „ isn't he
what was he doing
coughing
because it went down the wrong hole „ didn't it he said
it's rude to stare Thomas
when the men are working and they're climbing up ladders it's alright to watch that
but it's not nice to stare now „ is it
you see when BobtheBuilder's working he works very hard
he needs a little rest sometimes „ doesn't he
he sits down and has a little tea break
that's right
you're eating some more cheese
and what about the digger man
do you think your digger man deserves a little rest
because he as been working hard „ hasn't he
and not only has he been working hard
he as been galloping up and down his digger
mhm

that's a funny noise
what's the digger man saying
what's he saying
I would imagine he's shouting help let me down I'm trapped in the bucket
at the top of the digger
isn't that what he's saying
is that not what he's saying Thomas
oh he as fallen down now
I be he as bumped his helmet
it's a jolly good job he was wearing a helmet

Dig and Doug and Daisy too
oh dear dear

that's a jigsaw „ isn't it
OldMacDonald's farm

look at the shape of it
it's the shape of OldMacDonald „ isn't it
that's right
well put him there first and he can look after everybody
what's he wearing
a hat
and
he's wearing green Wellingtons
who else has green Wellingtons
Grandad
and also Dorothy from PostmanPat
do you remember PostmanPat delivering her a parcel and it was green Wellingtons
right
OldMacDonald had a farm and on that farm he had a
a pig
right

is that a pig shape
aah
yes
I think it is
does that fit in there
yes
so OldMacDonald's chewing a piece of corn and he as got a little chicken in his hand and now he as got a pig to look after
who else lived on the farm
the cockerel
cockadoodledoo
that's another thing that AlfThompson has on his farm in the PostmanPat book „ isn't it
it says a cockerel crows
cockadoodledoo
so shall we put the cockerel
mhm
the cockerel there
and the baalamb
where does the sheep go
does it stay there
that's lovely
and there's only one more thing on OldMacDonald's farm and that's a
and can you find where that slots into
yes
there's sunshine there
the sun is shining down on all the animals
oh I see
now OldMacDonald as got his cow and his pig and his sheep and his cockerel he as got up
he as gone for a walk round „ has he
look
here's another OldMacDonald from your tractor set
he's wearing a hat as well „ isn't he
and has he got green Wellingtons
and look
also in your tractor we've got a cow a pig and a sheep
we've also got a dog „ haven't we
there isn't a dog on the jigsaw puzzle
don't throw Thomas
that's not nice „ is it
do you wanna do the jigsaw again
shall I show you how to get the pieces out
at the back of the board there are little holes that you just push your finger in
and then the pieces lift up like that
let's put the farmer back
and then you put your finger underneath and push him up through the hole there look
pop
wanna push him again
oh
he's jumping OldMacDonald „ isn't he
you liked him
did you say I like you
I like you
pushing him with your fingers through the holes
is he a big man
he needs to be a big strong man to look after all those animals „ doesn't he
why don't you do the jigsaw again and then push them all out
you've got to make it first before anybody can drop out „ haven't you
we've got another jigsaw here as well
a Teletubby jigsaw
but that's not the same „ is it
we don't needta push those out
can you hear Alice barking
right
shall we put the other things back
and then you can push them all out
there's the sheep
the cockerel
and the cow
and
and the what
the pig
what did you call him

what on earth's a notnot
a funny notnot
because it's a piggywigwig
well do you want me to put the pieces into the tractor

and then you can put the animals straight inside
they've all fallen on the floor „ haven't they
right
who's going in the tractor
I don't think the whole board will go in the tractor
let's just put the animals and the farmer in the tractor
yes
that's because it's too big Thomas
the jigsaw puzzle is like a field
it's where all the animals are sitting
you can't put a whole field in a tractor
you take the animals one at a time out of the field and load them into the trailer
oh there's Purdie
meow
