and a car
you want me to sit there
I'm frightened I'll go to sleep

ah this is a nice crocodile
I think Dimitra will be very proud of you when I tell her what as happened this week
we forgot
oh yes
we forgot the Cornflakes in Tesco
but that's not really why Dimitra's going to be proud of you „ is it

the other day Thomas had three pussy cats to look after
one was Jess PostmanPat's cat
the black and white cat
the other was Purdie's little kitten
well the other two were both Purdie's little soft toys „ weren't they
Ginger and Gingells
and Thomas fed them and gave them water and brushed them and played with them and put them to sleep
and he really looked after them
and so I said if he treated Purdie as nicely we'd give him some stars
and when he got seven stars on a piece of paper
yes
when you got seven stars on the piece of paper every day you had a little treat „ didn't you
and you had jelly babies one day
we went for a walk another day
and Daddy gave you his old mobile phone „ didn't he
as a treat the other day
and since we've started that you've been as good as gold to Purdie „ haven't you
it's just round here
only once have we heard Thomas squeal at Purdie
in nearly a week
you show Dimitra how that works
that's yours „ isn't it
and so he as been a really good boy to Purdie
oh you've been a good crocodile to Purdie „ have you
and she as appreciated it „ hasn't she
yes
in the morning he gets up and he goes to see how she is
and he strokes her
and gives her a kiss

I'm sure you can play with it
you must ask first
but just be careful
it's stickers
WinniethePooh stickers
why don't you go and sit on Dimitra's knee and let her do it
hm
you can make a nice scene „ can't you
make a scene
yes
you was making a scene „ weren't you

a different sort of scene
making a picture
there you are
would you like to go and do that with Dimitra
you're lying on the grass „ are you

they're probably looking for crocodiles
and here's Tigger
Tigger's bouncing along after Eeyore looking for crocodiles
oh

oh
help
you can't go to sleep now „ can you
hm
which one's Tigger
and which one's Eeyore

oh
I tell you what
a butterfly
shall we see if one of the butterflys wants to fly
very quickly through the tunnel
whoosh
no
no crocodiles there
the has as got to stay there on the branch
it looks like we've got a bee attached to that butterfly
yes
I would imagine that bee
oh look where it as landed
on Winnie's nose
I think the bee was hovering around the honey and then the next thing we knew it went on Winnie's nose
oh
a crocodile
oops a daisy
a crocodile could snap my nose „ couldn't it
what can the crocodile see
a big ring
oh right
going to put that on your finger
on the big crocodile's finger
your nice blue ring
I do like this
crocodile's going in the jungle
wearing a ring
nobody's crying

where as the orange ring gone
you don't know
I can see some more rings in there
I can see a blue one

this reminds me of a crown Thomas
do you know when we went to the post box yesterday
and you were looking at it
it has a crown on the post box „ doesn't it
RoyalMail
yes
some lovely things
that looks like a watch strap
you putting those under as well
that looks like a watch strap
that looks like a crown
what does this look like
it's more like a butcher
hm
I think it's some funny ears
look
Thomas
oh yes
you could be a reindeer
and what are these
are these pipes
they're tubes „ aren't they
it's a little bit like the day the gas man came to replace the radiators
remember he had all those pipes upstairs
do you remember that Thomas
and what are these
looks like a boomerang
or a funny banana
or a sandwich
you think it's an apple

it could be a wedge of apple I suppose „ couldn't it
a slice
you look like a Teletubby

more like Dipsy
yes
Dipsy has a thing that sticks up „ doesn't he
gosh
now you see that's more like Dipsy because that's green
that's like Dipsy
that's Dipsy
and Po is round like that
and TinkyWinky is a triangle
and oh
Lala as got a funny one
Lala as got a whoa
they've all got different things „ haven't they
we'd be better to do it with this
that's Dipsy straight up
that's Lala twisty
that's TinkyWinky a triangle
and Po is round
Po's a circle

you wanna be TinkyWinky „ do you
aerials
I couldn't think of the right words
because they've got televisions in their tummy „ haven't they „ Teletubbies
and in order to make their televisions work they've got to have aerials on their heads
and TinkyWinky's is a triangle
it's not a terribly good triangle
but we've got the gist „ don't we
there
TinkyWinky Dipsy Lala

we've not
is it more like Lala
the twisty one
we've not seen TinkyWinky's face
that's like Lala „ isn't it
yes
if you put a twist in that will be excellent „ wouldn't it
that's the color of Lala
this is the color of TinkyWinky
and this is the color of Dipsy
but I can't see anything red like Po
we've got orange but we haven't got red „ have we
shall we get a Teletubby
excuse me
I shall just
it's alright
right
there we are
Po
TinkyWinky
Dipsy

you're introducing yourself to them and then saying goodbye
hello Po
ThomasHenry Lastname
bye bye
you want to do a tune
aren't their television tummys nice
oh
I didn't think the voice box was in that one
look
Lala as got a bag on her back „ hasn't she
what could be in the back of Lala
oh I know
it's an old muslin cloth from when we useta carry drinks round so we could wipe your face
I don't think we need that in there
