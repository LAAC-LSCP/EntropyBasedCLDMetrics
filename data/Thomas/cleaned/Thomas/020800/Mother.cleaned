let's have a look and see what we've got
now we've got to be very careful with this because this is a present for Abigail
are you going to look at this first

where have the slippers gone now
Thomas
oh

can you see Abigail walking around in these
no
probably gone somewhere
who Abigail
oh Thomas
I think you've probably gone down there
I can see you
well we were going to get those little red slippers with a FatherChristmas on them then we thought Abigail as got such tiny feet that they're probably too big for her and by the time she can wear them it might be the summer not Christmas so we got these little hedgehog ones
cause she can wear those
look
can you see the gift bag it as come in
oh
you could if you looked
well I'm going to look
it as got it as got hedgehogs
look
one hedgehog is like PostmanPat
he's carrying parcels
and there's another one on a sledge
or a sleigh
another one tobogganing down a hill
aw
look at this hedgehog
what as he done
he as slipped „ hasn't he
and do you know what this little bird's called with the red breast
a snake
no
he's called a robin
look
there's another robin there
two robins
ooh
it's the same picture on the other side
do you think she'll like those
they're not too dirty
they're not
they're brand new
going to sit down
well I was going to look at some other things in this bag
we'll hafta buy a little toy or a book to go with this
would you like drink
oh
these are for Thomas
look
what are they
green gloves
you've got some blue gloves we bought at the same shop last year and they've been great „ haven't they
so this time we thought we'd get a different color to go with your brown coat and then we can leave the blue ones in your blue coat
look
they fit me
hello
the blue ones for staying in the blue coat and the green ones for staying in the brown coat and then when you go out you've always got a pair of mittens
because this morning it was cold „ wasn't it
wasn't it cold and windy
well the fireman needs gloves
your going to get the hosepipe
what else would you like
oh
I know what you're going to use as a hosepipe
yes
that's the fishing rod
I knew you were going to get that
is that your hosepipe
that also is the thing you use when PostmanPat's van gets stuck in the mud
you use that to tow his van away „ don't you
that fishing rod's really very useful
it is the fireman's hosepipe
and is there water coming out
a lot of fires
burn you
oh yes
fires do burn „ don't they
you hafta be very careful
well do you need your gloves on Thomas
firemen usually wear gloves
you don't wanna wear your gloves
no
okay

are you going to put it out
with your hosepipe
stretch it
you're stretching it
doesn't quite reach the fire engine „ does it
oh look
yes
are you going to lift the bag up
that's very clever

will we take out what's in the bag and then it's easier to lift
what else is in the bag
just be careful with that
they're not socks
what's this
a jumper
is this for Thomas
look at that
wow
is that a big fancy jumper
bricks
that's true
it looks like building bricks „ doesn't it
it's very fleecy and it's possibly a little bit big for you
but it's better to buy it big and then you can put something else on underneath
do you like the colors
they're checks „ aren't they
you're going to show me
please may I take these little things out of the bag
because I don't know what else the lady has kept in
so you're a lucky boy „ aren't you
having a new jumper and some gloves and Abigail as got a pair of slippers
pardon
I thought you said you ad dropped a tomato
you're stretching
what are you doing now Thomas
the hosepipe
why's the hosepipe lifting up the bag
yes
it's going in the fire engine now „ is it
you know what that could mean Thomas
have you seen fire men when they are rescuing somebody from very high
from very high
when they're rescuing somebody from some where very high
they often have
I don't know what it's called but it's on an elevator and it goes up
and down
so this could go up somewhere and rescue somebody from a burning building and then bring them down safely „ couldn't it
how about PostmanPat
PostmanPat is trapped very high
look
it's high up
he's trapped
help
he's shouting out of the window
let's take the fire engine elevator up
don't worry
don't worry
let's lift it up and we can pop him in there look
and then we can lift him down again
that's right
we'll put him in there and then we can lift him down safely „ can't you
lift him back down to the ground safely
he wants rescuing again „ does he
help
help
just a minute PostmanPat
Thomas is coming
just a minute
Thomas he's back here
Thomas

quickly
there's a fire and PostmanPat's burning
the fireman's running
well are you not going to come with a bag
and the elevator to lift him down
but he'll burn
will he not
oh
well he's very frightened
I think he needs some help
the fireman's running
you've found that now „ have you
just be careful waving it about
lift Mummy up now
oh
there we are
do you know who else you could lift up with that
you could lift Po up
because Po has a little loop on her head „ doesn't she

Po would be very very easy to lift up with that „ wouldn't she
you're getting Jess up as well

that was very exciting „ wasn't it
he did that last week as well
you all gathered around the big drum and he put a piece of wood in the middle
and as you bang the drum what happened to the stick
it fell down at your side
it kept jumping up and down „ didn't it
it's very windy today „ wasn't it
walking to bangadrumtime
you were wearing your coat and hat and scarf and gloves
and it was hailstoning and windy and the next minute the sun was shining „ wasn't it
