I'm going to get very cross with you
right
just sit still
before I get very cross
well if you don't eat any more that's fair enough
it's your loss
but
oy
when you leave the table there's nothing else
you're a bit giddy today „ aren't you
well it's a sausage Thomas
of course it's got a bit of brown on it
and if we cook an orangutan
for Daddy's tea
that'll have lotsof brown on it
do you not think Daddy would like that
he would
hm do you think I've got a pan big enough
how big are orangutans
that big
hm well
well I don't think we could fit in the microwave
it might not fit in the oven either
we could wrap it in foil
and just put it straight in the oven „ couldn't we
mhm
I couldn't boil it
it would hafta be roast orangutan
excuse me
roastie
probably call you something as well
if it knew what it what you were going to do to it
sorry
burst it into the oven
you mean
you mean push it in
squeeze it in
is that what you mean
by burst it in the oven
oh right
mhm hm
it does
mhm hm
it's quite quiet „ isn't it
did you
what was it
a bird or a train
oh I heard something
but it sounds like somebody moving something outside
sounded like somebody dragging something quite heavy
perhaps

how do I draw the
ow
dragging a
thank you Thomas
I'll just
I've just fallen over the mop bucket
I can't imagine anybody dragging
a bulldozer
perhaps bringing an orangutan up the path
what do you think
oh

you nearly fell off the table then „ didn't you
well your arm fell off
right
I'm finishing off with a piece of fruit loaf
would you like some
you don't hate it
you didn't hate it the other day when you had it
mm
you had teeny bites several times
every time you walked past you had a teeny bite
until in the end there was nothing left
catalog's come through today about the books
you can after lunch yes
no
come on
try and eat a bit more
you've not had any bread yet Thomas
hm
this book would suit you Thomas
it's rude
it's a book called the Queen's knickers
a a charming very funny and genuinely affectionate picture book in which a little girl looks forward to the Queen's visit to her school and wonders what knickers Her Majesty would choose to wear
will they be her at home knickers adorned with Corgis or her garden party knickers
or perhaps her woolly Ballmoral ones
both children and adults will will love this classic book with it's endearing insight into a child's imagination
no
we buy these books at MissusPlatford's don't we
and it raises money for
doesn't raise money for the nursery
but what happens
every time you buy a book
then points go to the nursery
when the nursery have got so many points
they can buy new books
well that's fair enough Thomas
but I'll tell you now
no
if you leave the table now
you can tell me as many times as you like
this afternoon that you're hungry
but I am not giving you anything else until tea time
no
because I haven't finished my lunch
will you turn round please
why don't you have a piece of bread Thomas
because a sausage alone won't really fill you up
and you kept saying to me I'm hungry I want my lunch
and now you've had your lunch you've hardly eaten it
right
you've got to stop now
because can you see what I can see up there
red light
so the battery's going flat
so we'll just hafta stop for the moment
okay
I'll tell you what I can hear now
it sounds like somebody's cutting their grass
doesn't it
can't you hear it
yes I think urr
is somebody cutting their grass
pardon
oh that was silly „ wasn't it
oh you are giddy this afternoon
too much sun
look at the shape of the batteries
they are actually quite flat
to look at
no I think they're flat like a back
they're oblong „ aren't they
they're flat
but a flat battery
means it's run out
you know
no
sit up
sit up please
no
when you've
well you know how you've got batteries
in some of your toys
well we always say to you you must remember to turn it off
when you're not playing with it otherwise the battery will go flat
well what it means is it will run out of power
oh Lordy
oh it's so loud now
and there's nothing I can do about it
oh Thomas
what am I going to do with you
hey
hey
there's another
no
in this kitchen everything is on the same level
but they're built one on top of another
oh that's coming out
the garden
no sounds coming through and I don't know why
no
it's not
the light's
I don't know why
I'll have a good listen
just talk to me again
just say something else to me please
oh the lawnmower's gone off
just so I can hear now
right
it's this one again
look

oops
right
Thomas tell me something about squashed batteries
and flat batteries and
now when I said say something I didn't mean for you to be rude



no
no
I made a
noise
we seem to be having great problems with this
oy you'll be wishing you weren't yourself in a minute
when I come and off for playing with those blinds
right
I think that's actually
no
calm down
no
no
no
no
don't Thomas
because the blind will break
if you mess with
we've got a problem with one of the aerials
because
no
not the aerial of your racing car
the aerial of the recording equipment
because the orange light keeps going off
and the aerial doesn't seem quite right
and every time I pull it down it's
yes only green
the orange one's going off
started again
yes we can
right
have you finished your lunch
are you sure
okeydokey
right
what a
and then I'll have it
no
sit back
sit back
I don't mind whether you want any more or not
we'll just
Thomas
right
come on just stand up please and wait
no
sit back at the table please
right
I'll put those sausages
back in a little pot
that will do
we'll have those another time „ can't we
yes finish that piece of bread please
that'll be a good boy
but just remember that's it now
okay
you can have a piece of fruit if you like
would you like some fruit
pardon
no thank you
the washing's on the line
that's looking good „ isn't it
stay there
Thomas
what have you done down there
what's that
what is it
mm
well I think I know
I think you've wiped your hands on your clothes „ haven't you
wipe them on that
going to take you out later on
you look like a raggamuffin now
no
that won't help „ will it
you certainly have
you're looking an even bigger mess pot than usual
did you really rub it
or was it just that you dropped some sausage on yourself
well that's different „ isn't it
if you dropped that's better than
no
go back Thomas
can you not do what you're told
right
rub your hands on that cloth there please
right
now wipe your face
because I thought you wanted to look at Purdie's present
right
well then
we don't know what's in it
so we'd better open and see
it hasn't actually come addressed to Purdie
it's come to P Lastname
which could be Purdie Lastname but
I think it's more likely to be Peter
as in Daddy „ don't you
Peter
not really
Peter the heater

ha Peter the heater
oh could do with him and plug him in on a cold night
couldn't we
right
let's see

right
it's a free sample from Sainsbury's Pet Club
oh wow
look at that
one two three four five six
sachets of cat food
what a lucky puss
goodness me
that's worth a lot of money
there's one with rabbit in gravy
Whiskers with turkey and gravy
Whiskers with tuna in jelly
Whiskers with chicken in jelly
Whiskers with salmon and brawn in jelly
and Whiskers with beef in jelly
oh no
there's no orangutan

no whiskers with orangutan in jelly
or gravy or
or the Whiskers says Whiskers with life care
for a long healthy life
well Purdie's had quite a long healthy life already
hasn't she
just leave them in
no
leave them in the
but no
leave them in there Thomas please
leave them in there please
ah
there's bound
there's bound to be a little trick now
it want s us to
fill in a questionnaire
it says would your cat choose Whiskers
and it asks us all sorts of things like
do we feed our cat Whiskers regularly
and where do we buy it from
oh and then there's some vouchers Thomas
look at that
when we go
I said I wanted some cat food „ didn't I
we don't actually hafta buy any now
mind you we better had in case she doesn't like that
but she always has Whiskers anyway

it's two pouches free
you can buy twelve for the price of ten
because they're obviously new „ aren't they
now then
look at this
can you see this nice picture
who's that look like
apart from it's not as fluffy
Purdie
and look at this picture
right
how many pussy cats are there
well start at the white cat
well start at the white cat
one two three four five six
seven eight nine
clever boy
right
who's that one look like
that white one looks like Snowy
Mummy's pussy cat at home
it just looks like Purdie
that looks like
Edith
so looks like Felix
that one looks like that baddie grey and white cat
that comes and duffs Purdie up
oh actually
no
that looks like Felix
but who does that look like
no
the pussy cat
doesn't it
that looks more like Felix
and that looks like Gelly
I don't know a cat like that „ do you
whose
Missus Ashworth's cat
oh right
okay
your nursery teacher's cat
I know who that looks like
Molly next door
and Purdie yet again
that's more like Purdie
that's a little tabby „ isn't it
how nice
so nine pussy cats
shall we give them all a name

Honey Dunny and Silly

well I would say Snowy
Purdie
Ginger
Felix baddie cat
Gelly
Daisy because it looks like a daisy
I think we've got a book about a cat
that looks like that called Daisy
Wally
and we can't call that Purdie
we'll call it Purds
purding wort
right
oh it's just telling you how to open the packets „ isn't it
well when she comes in
tell her she's got a really nice present

yeah
oh I think she's alright actually for now
I just fed her before we had our lunch
isn't that nice
so that's
ow
mind my foot
so that's from Sainsbury's Pet Club
well you do
because when you were a baby
we filled in a little form
for both Tesco and Sainsbury's
and what they do every now and again
they send a magazine
and it was all about
yes it was all about young babies
and they would send little offers
little vouchers
so that when we went to the shop
we could buy things for the baby cheaper
certain things
oh it's not red again „ is it
oh dear me
problem with that
the battery must not have been new one that we put in
must have been a flat one
anyway you know
it's one of them I think it's Sainsbury's
still send us things
because it's naught to five club
but Tesco has stopped sending us free things
but Sainsbury's had a pet club
and so Daddy
this is why it comes to MisterP Lastname
because Daddy filled in a little form
so we now get vouchers and a magazine
for Purdie every now and again
right
I'll hafta sort this battery out

won't I
