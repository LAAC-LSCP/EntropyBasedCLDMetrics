well poof gosh it does smell
listen
Thomas
if you're going to be a fireman
you're going to hafta get useta smelly smoke „ aren't you
yes
I'll tell you who I feel sorry for
I don't feel sorry for Missus Battersby
with her washing because it's her barbeque
and she can take her clothes in
but when I have a barbeque
Rachel next door gets all her washing out
and so she's got the smoke from Missus Battersby
and she's got the smoke from us
oh dear there's another fire alarm
that's because we had the door open
right
so we stood at the Spa shops
and we decided we want boxes of sweets
Martin's sweets could be melting morsels I think
do you know what a morsel is
a tiny thing
something very small
you know like a small
a small mouthful of food
I can still hear the ice cream man
you sell cat food and a lot of shell peas
because I thought you were such a convenience store
I want some food for my pussy cat please
smarties
you see they would melt „ wouldn't they on a hot day
smartie cat food
well there were smartie on the barbeque Tom
I think they're all mm
imagine the color
red and yellow and pink and blue
orange and purple and green
I think I must have the colors wrong then
and I'll play it for you

come here
if you ate one of yours go like this
there
and there's lotsof barbeque smoke walking past
not walking past floating past the window

silly Mum

do you think it would need a walking stick to walk past

do you think it would need a walking stick
olderly
elderly smoke
I think it's fairly new smoke
fairly fresh „ don't you
moving down
that down
no
so far I've wanted an ice lolly
and I've ended up with some Martin Morsel sweets
then I wanted some cat food
and I've ended up with a box
of smarties barbeque
cat food
oh right
do you think Purdie would know
pardon

tee
tee for trouble
t for trouble and Thomas

very strange „ won't you
quite different „ isn't it
bye


oops a daisy
„ aren't you

it's a lovely shop that
do you remember Dimitra buying you that
I don't think it was just from Dimitra
I think it was from everybody
but Dimitra knew that you liked playing with shops
oh you're very rackety and rowdy in your shop
is it time for a delivery to come
why are you on the roof
do you hafta do that every morning
oh it's night time
it says closed
do you hafta do that every day
well can you not just have
you know like you see in shops
how they have a sign on the back of the door
and you just turn it round to say it's open or closed
you hafta have one on the roof do you
it's what you hafta do every
Thomas
what do you do
come along with your

oh right
where are you going to go
pardon
oh

oh was that shush
not again
I will
just one moment Thomas
honey
right
so what are we doing now
goodness me
I'm going to the Spa shop
it's being knocked down
by well it looks like a combine harvester
surely not
hello
hello
what do you think you're doing Mister Combine Harvester
or tractor man
what are you
why are you chopping down
I got there
chopping down the Spa Shop
somebody smashed the shop down
so you're smashing it down as well
well who smashed the shop down
that's not a very nice thing to do „ is it
well why are you smashing the shop down
why are you smashing the shop down Thomas
a new Spa Shop
oh I see
you're demolishing it „ are you
but you're doing it properly
it's not because you're in a bad mood or anything
you're knocking it down so you can build a new one „ are you
and what's the new one going to be like
very big
and what sort of things will it hold
what will it stock
and will I still be able to buy things like ice lollies
and Martin sweets
and things like that
right
Martin sweets
so you mean they're knocking down a really reasonable Spa Shop
to make an absolutely enormous shop
that will only sell sweets
that's some sort of shop „ isn't it
that is your sort of shop
repolished
it's repolished
or do you mean refurbished
repolished
ha
wonderful
so can I come in shopping now
oh see I don't think I'm going to be able to get to the shop
if the ground's all been cut up „ will I
how would I be able to get to the ground
if the shop's all chopped up
I mean the
how will I be able to get to the shop
if the ground's all chopped up
on the bus
oh
I think the bus has gone on the motorway „ don't you
oh that's like a holiday bus
hello
hello
could I have
a return please
to the very new Spa shop
do I hafta pay with money
oh is this a free service
right
right
right
oh it says closedq
I'll ring and see if anybody comes
oh hello MisterShopKeeper
well I like your new shop
had a few problems getting here though
because the ground's all been broken up and I
I thought I was going to hurt my ankle
falling over bits of rubble
and broken bits of paving slabs and things

did it
that was very quick work „ wasn't it
well I mean at first
I did actually see that there were some cones here
some small traffic cones „ aren't there
so were they warning me
were they warning me that the road was
no
I can just hear boom
I can't actually tell what it is
can you

come on baby lets be so quiet
I don't think that's the song I heard Thomas
who sings that
Robbie Williams
does he
no
I can't tell what it is
a Range Rover
I'm just wondering where Daddy's doing our barbeque actually Thomas
I know where they're doing their barbeque
be careful with that door
if you go out
right
come back inside
come back inside
Daddy says he's gone to the garage to get some fire lighters
well a garage
you know a garage where they sell petrol
they'll often sell things like that
because the thing is Thomas we've not used
oh I certainly have yes
oh I see
in the spa shop is there a post box as well
it's a post office as well „ is it
oh I was just saying we might use the barbeque
for quite a long time
and when we said do you fancy a barbeque
I actually thought Daddy might nip to the garage
and get one of those
have you seen those disposable ones
they are sort a big foil tray
and they've got the coals already in
and then you just throw it away
when you've finished it but
I think it was
I don't know whether it was Fathers Day
sometime a while ago
we bought a barbeque
do you remember
and it was folded up in the shed
that nice blue one
and that's what Daddy's using now
so when you see my sausages
well I would
have you
so this absolutely wonderful new complex
and with all the road up
you only stock milk and juice
oh what's that
oh cornflakes and coffee
ah well you see that's very handy
because if you wake up in the morning
and you think oh I fancy a bowl of cornflakes
and a cup of coffee
you'd probably be able to help out „ wouldn't you
there'd be no problem with that
so I'll just come along
and I'll post these
outside for posting letters
yes
first class and second class I have
yes
oh yes one for America
one to Australia
oh actually I should have gone into the post office
and had these weighed
and special stamps put on them
oh that says Ipswich Town
so I'll send that to Ipswich Town
and this one's to Glossop
that one to Glossop
and that one says from York to Manchester
so we'll put that there
and this one's from Manchester to Glossop
so that one can go to Manchester
look
there's another little fly inside
oh thank you very much
that's for the special one is it

right
I'll stick that on that one to America
right
off it goes
thank you
now while I'm here
do you know I'm so thirsty
I think when I go home I might put my feet up
with a nice cup of coffee
do you sell coffee
oh how nice
and do you sell milk as well
well I don't want cornflakes for breakfast
but my little boy Thomas likes mixing up chocolate in the cornflakes
oh
we could do that „ couldn't we
mm I would like one of those as well
I bet you don't sell chocolate to melt there „ do you
I bet you don't sell chocolate to melt
you're looking for that smartie box now „ aren't you
and I don't know what we've done with it
oh wow look at the size of that box of chocolate
that's really nice
actually if I was buying chocolate to melt
into rice crispies then I'd buy a bar of chocolate
really rather than a heavy box „ wouldn't you
twenty grams of chocolate
well twenty grams of chocolate
well I'm sure that will melt in very nicely
now is there anything else that you think I'd like
while I'm here
some orange juice
well yes I could have some orange juice „ couldn't I
no
I don't think I'll buy clothes in Oxfam
thank you
mind you I could do
because then after I've made
melted some chocolate and put cornflakes in
to make crispie cakes
put the kettle on to have a nice cup of coffee
and I'd put a closed sign on the door
then nobody would disturb me
while I have a nice cup of coffee
what do you think to that
oh I've just found one of these things here Thomas
the other thing from the Spa shop
or they could come in a delivery „ could they
right
well what shall we use as a delivery truck
okay
oh wonderful
absolutely great
just
yes
is it
I'm just a little bit worried about how loud that music is
but the trouble is
oh it is but
the trouble is I needta do a tape
and we can't wait for them to turn the music off
because it doesn't look like they're going to
well it wouldn't be so bad if we could tell what it is
boom baboom
can't we
so
have they
no
I think it's alright
it's just I've just listened to the
with the head phones on
and it doesn't sound very nice
am I the delivery man
right
here's the delivery van
oh I've found another bus as well
are you still doing that little side line
while you're driving buses
pardon
you are
right
oh no
that's it I mean it's a little awkward „ isn't it
but I mean really
well a clock
why a clock
oh right
well you see
normally
they don't have music on loud
I think I think this little party they're having
is just you know not something that happens very often „ is it
and normally this time of afternoon or day
it's about five o'clock
no
they couldn't though
this is what I mean Thomas
it's not normally a nuisance
or it wouldn't be a nuisance „ would it
it's just a the moment we want a little bit of quiet „ don't we
however we'll hafta put up with it
well I bet he's gone for a quick bite to eat
at that party over the way
you think so
do you think we'll have lotsof sausages
later on
excuse me
let's not gek
get all the
hello
here's your delivery
you're the postman as well
have they
oh very good
well at least my letters are on their way
oh
okay
yes
right
have you got your order sheet anywhere
because you see what happens is
you hafta look round the shop Thomas
and you hafta say right well
one or two customers have been asking for tea
and I don't stock tea
so next time I'll just order tea
or else oh we've sold loads of cornflakes
we needta order more
what you do is you have like a shopping list
but imagine if you're running a shop
it's a huge thing to do a stock take
and then you've either
what are you using for
no
put it down Tom please
no
right and that's your list
okay then
so Daddy's coming back now
so you would either hafta fax an order
to the supplier place
or you'll hafta phone up
and then you see they come
but when they're unloading it
you needta check up what they're sending you
because they might send you something you haven't ordered
or they might not send you enough of something and charge you
you needta check it off
you're looking through your camera
have you
because it's no good you ordering
fifty boxes of peas and then charging you for fifty boxes of peas
if they only sent you five „ is it
right
oh it's hard work

oh well you've waited until I've put the last thing in the shop
before you're asking me
hello Daddy have you got your fire lighters
oh yes very good
I can't the Co op
oh look
Daddy's been to a sort of Spa shop type place
to buy those
yes
so you're happy with all that
I've unpacked all these
yes
right
you know you should be there ticking off what your man's bringing in
excuse me driver excuse me
are you the driver
excuse me delivery man
I just

right
where's my mobile phone

brrr
brrr oh bother
his phone's broke
what am I going to do
oh oh what am I going to do
never mind
I know I won't use that supplier anymore
I'll got to somebody else who's more reliable
I think though part of the problem was
the poor delivery man unloaded all those things by himself
I think he was thirsty and a bit tired
I think may be if we give him a life he will do it
not if we'd helped him
and given him a drink
he wouldn't have been in such a hurry to have left „ would he
do you think that was the problem
just pretend
just just pretend
thank you
but I thought I was a customer
well
am I
I was going to say I'm a bit confused
because I started off as a customer first
accepting the deliveries
oh I'm going to make the shop a wonderful place
I want people to come from all over
it'll be nice
I that naughty delivery man
didn't deliver
or somebody has stolen them

they're here
guess what
I've been sitting on the box
I'm sitting on the box with my clip board
checking off all the orders
and I'm sitting on a box of cornflakes
don't mean a little box like this packet
I mean a big box of like
fifty packets of cornflakes in it

look
it's all squashed
well hafta do now
do you know what I'll hafta do with these boxes
now I've sat on them and squashed them
hafta put a reduced sign on
reduced
box damaged due to big fat bottom sitting on them
fifty pee
there we are
I'm sure people will buy them now
oh there's the phone
I don't think they will though
perhaps if it says big fat bottom sitting on them
what do you think
what gates
no
oh I'm a bit confused as to what we're doing now
because I was interrupted by the phone
what gates then
oh is that a gate
I think I was confused before I went to the phone
because I wasn't sure if I was a shop lady
the delivery man or the customer
bye
pardon
I was
for putting fuel in
oh yes
oh be careful
mm
she'll be alright
puss
don't stand there so you could
it was the white plastic ones
that I use all the time in the kitchen
I didn't wanna
those stainless steel ones are the ones we use for the barbeque
because if I use the white plastic ones that I have
I think they might melt
no
not made of
oh no
no
no
it's sort of
no
plastic
we've talked about lotsof melting things
melting Munchies
what were they
melting Morsels
yeah they melt because they're chocolate
then there's ice
what's the matter with you Darling
you look confused
right
okay
okay

oh goodness me
well I think I'm going to sack my delivery man
you know he didn't deliver any cornflakes
or at least I thought he hadn't
and then I found he had and he'd actually sat on them
he's dumped a lot of stuff into the till
that's a funny place
I wanted it round the back
in the stock room
and I could keep going from the stock room
to get some things to put on the shelves
it depends on what we're selling
oh no
what's he doing in the office with that key
he had the yellow key
because he said I just wanna go and pop something in here
and I said well here's my yellow key
but please make sure you return it
and he hasn't done „ has he
and who are you
oh right
oh I see
I know what's happened
I've just this bunch of keys
I'm trying to open the post box with
it says delivery lorry
do you know what's happened
that delivery man
you know what we've done
you know what we've done
oh well sillybilly mail man
he's gone off with my key to the post box
and I've got the key to his truck
but the thing is
well I know what it means
it means that delivery man
can't have got very far
because he can't have even got in his lorry
to drive away
so he must be in the car park
hello
delivery man
hello
I think we've got the wrong keys
here you are
thank you
very nice to see you
guess what
I found the cornflakes I thought you hadn't delivered
I was sitting on them
and all the boxes are squashed
because of my fat bottom on them
so I've hadta reduce them now
bye
I'll see you next week
when you come next week
let's just keep an eye on these keys
okay
bye

okay
right

MissusCornflake
shop keeper
well this isn't „ is it
the delivery man brought my key back for the post box
I've opened the post box up
there's no letters in the post box
what a to do
that's a very funny business
a slate
coming up the back
why is there a slate coming off the back

I thought that was the petrol pump
or the delivery truck
if it's a snake
oh well I think he'll remember that
he'll know where he's left it „ won't he
surely
I don't think he really needs the name on that one
because it's obvious it belongs to a delivery truck „ isn't it
what on earth is that noise
hello Mister Delivery driver
are you banging because there's something the matter
with the coach or the truck
your diesel thing

only I don't know why the off switches in a diesel go pshh

right
right
don't shout
I think we'd better put barriers round these
if somebody slips there
they're sure to get annoyed „ aren't they
put some cones out for this box „ shall we
yes Thomas
oh very good
well that should stop people from slipping
shouldn't it
what do you think on a shop

what do you think about the Spa
it's healthy or not
oh is that what it means
so if I get a tick
it means the till's right
and if it's a cross it means the till's down
out of money
oh luckily the right money's there
uhoh
oh that's the money from the safe
did he
good I'm glad
that'll teach him „ won't it
to break into people's houses
and trying to
and what's that

for France
why are you going to France
your phone's there
right
oh I'll pretend I got my key back
from that silly delivery man
oh dear
he heard me
do you know why
because I've got the microphone here
when I wanna say
Mister Lastname to the checkout please
Mister Lastname to the car park
could I have the please
I've got this behind the counter
it's a microphone
I'd forgotten it booms out into the car park
so I bet Mister Delivery man must have heard me say
something about him
Mister Lastname to the checkout please
oh I can open my post box
now that silly truck man's brought my key back
ah but you see the thing is
I can't hear
it's not a two way radio
I can give messages
but I can't hear
so he can complain all he likes in the car park
but I won't hear him
oh I've just looked out of the window
and I think what's the silly truck driver
shouting down his diesel pipe
well it looks like a diesel pipe to me
Thomas that's not
that's not nice
I suppose I did say you were a silly delivery man
you can yes
right
I'll I'll knock off for the night
and I'll check off
while you check the till
there we are
the tills are right
there's your keys
I think so
well just wait Tom
til tea time please
okay
right
can the delivery man not do any more deliveries tonight
can I drive the coach instead
you think some people
oops a daisy
don't
oh because were so close didn't see all the cones
and the signs

do you think someone could
oh dear the till's wrong
do you think that some people who shop in your shop
would like a home delivery
so perhaps I could
you know the bus that we drive
yes
that's perhaps
I don't think they'll all fit in the coach
the delivery truck
I've got passengers as well
I've got a pussy cat called Purdie as well
who wants a lift home

meow
yes Purdie

certainly Purdie

she says she wants to sit in the front
and she's fed up of sitting on the box of smarties
cause it's melting
meow
that's
don't forget the tin of spaghetti you're waiting for
meow
meow
spaghetti yetti
a spaghetti yetti
have we
oh I know that's that bug Thomas
don't put your finger in the jelly welly
have we got that here
at school
don't put your finger in the jelly welly
here's something to stop

I don't know Darling
he is a shop keeper
right

I didn't
no
well I didn't know
not two new deliveries
I'll tell you what
I'm quite full after my barbeque tea „ are you
did you like that
have you noticed something else
what's not going on now
the music
they've turned it off „ haven't they
I think they've had their tea and gone in as well
it was nice that „ wasn't it
trouble is it's really not all that nice outside now
it was warm and it was nice to have our tea out
but it's not fantastic „ is it
so what are we doing now
shop keeper
I'm the shop keeper „ am I
right
well
am I expecting a delivery or a customer
a delivery
hello
I beg your pardon
there are strawberries that are orange
my goodness that is something
I've just looked in the shop

oh well if that delivery man hasn't gone off with my yellow key
not again
ah good
oh yes
I thought it was here because I actually wrote on the key
this key belongs to Missus Cornflake
at the corner shop
and look at the shop shelves
there's nothing on it
I hope you have brought me some nice things
oh goodness me
strawberries
one
this is strange
an orange strawberry
a red strawberry
oh that's a road sign
that's what we had on the ground
when the
oops

are you alright
oh I think that's done very well the shelf
excuse me
what sort of a shop is this
you're putting traffic cones
now you've delivered them
what sort of a shop is it
well it's a very funny work shop
it sells road signs cones and strawberries
and orange colored strawberries
for whose snack
oh I see
so I'm not selling strawberries in the shop „ am I
I'm just eating them for for a snack
mm yum
okay
„ weren't they
hello
I have yes
how many would you like
just one
there you are
could I have ten pence please for that
oh that sounds like there might be something in the purse
yes
have you
is that really a ten
let's have a look
let's have a look
oh no
that's a pound
that's a pound coin that one
when they're smallish
and fairly thick
that's a pound coin Thomas
the ten's a sort of silver one
much flatter and a little bit bigger
round
let's have a little look
well what a funny thing
that's a ten pence
what's it say on it
good boy
well done
that's very clever Thomas
thank you so much
enjoy your strawberry „ won't you
actually
could I just give you one of these
this is a new line we're doing
they're orange strawberries
and I just thought you might like to try one
if you like it I might sell some more

do you
Mama Mina
you keep saying MamaMina
did you
you said Mama Mina Thomas
Mama Mina
who says Mama Mina
your Mum
I'm your Mum
I don't
I've not heard Dad say it
is it on a or something
who does
Luke
yes please
yes because it's a bit draughty
in the shop when the door's open
and also guess what
stray dogs come in
oh yes
woof
oh there's one

careful please
don't bash into things
it's not nice
oh more strawberries
well yes they went down very well
because I had a customer in yesterday
who wanted all the red strawberry
and when I said we had some orange ones
he said he'd try one
and he really enjoyed it
so I'm glad you've got some more
are they freshly picked from the field
who has
cows have been wandering over the strawberries
that's alright then
green
oh I don't think they'll sell
because people will just think they're not ripe „ won't they
have a look
hm
a red one
people will like those
orange ones
yes in fact everyone liked the orange ones the other day
a green one
that doesn't really look very ripe „ does it
oh what's wrong
are you going to read a story
did it
let me have a look
ah two parcels oh dear
that was a mistake
I want a carton of milk
and I want a carton of orange juice
oh dear
soggy
oh dear
actually I think I could do with some cream
orange juice
strawberries are nice with orange juice sprinkled over them
because I don't think strawberries is enough
I think strawberries and cream would be nice

more strawberries
are these freshly picked
of course you can Sweetheart yes
right
let me pop them in the bag
don't
oh

well because they get lost „ don't they
what's this on here
what's all that red
is it paint off something
do you think perhaps it was the combine
when you were playing
with the combine harvester in the garden
think it might be
sorry
your peas are
Mister Cloggs
Mister Clarkes wants
Mister Clarke wants what
Mister Clarke sat on an orange
and he needed to change his bottoms

what's that
his
no
I know what his bottoms are
you mean the bottom half of him
you mean his trousers or his shorts „ don't you
the bottom half
but Mister Clarke sat on an orange
then he hadta change his bottoms
is that a rhyme you learnt
or have you just made it up
you made it up
sillybilly
okay
I can't walk through the post box

oh I thought I was a customer
well I think you'd better order them then
remember how we said we order things
you could either send a fax
hello
you can
or you can use the computer
or you can use a phone
but you're using the phone
what do you need
you can order strawberries you've never had yes
well we do red ones
which are the ones people usually have
but we've brought out a new line of orange ones
which go down really well
the yellow ones are not quite so juicy
and the green ones
if you keep them in a sunny place in the shop
will soon turn either orange or red
they'll ripen
or shall I have extra with those
right
now I've got some special offers on orange juice
have you
and I've got some biscuits
some nice jammy dodger type biscuits
thought you would
what about some sweets
oh yes
hm
yes watch out Thomas is about
and don't we know it
well at least that music's gone
did you enjoy your sausages
we had sausages
and I had kebabs
but you didn't have kebabs „ did you
you didn't
kebabs
well you know those things that Mummy and Daddy were having
on a skewer with a cube of chicken
and peppers and baby tomatoes
and sausage
and onion
oh it's nice
right
here's my delivery
actually I brought
I know you said you didn't want orange juice
but I brought it because
if you buy green strawberries
you get orange juice free
delivery for Mister Clarke
yes
I think he's probably changing his trousers
milk
jammy biscuits
orange juice
special strawberries
orange green yellow and red ones


I can't
I know
but then I wanna pick up again
ah dear
they might as well be
they might be soggy strawberries together
there we are
right
I'll send you my bill
of course you needta pay
if you want strawberries
oranges biscuits and the delivery
of course you hafta pay
have the lot
okay
I will
I hope there's a lot of money in here
silly shop keeper
right
let me see how how much money you've got here
that's alright
oh thank you
I don't think actually it will probably cost all that
one two pounds
three
four pounds
right
five pounds left
now I think it will cost you cost a little bit more
do you know what
do you know what happens Thomas
you would pay the delivery man
because you're buying a lot of things from me
there's no more
no
because it's all over the floor
pick it up please
no
no more

no
put it in the first one
because you're buying a lot of things from me
I can give you what's called a discount
which means I don't hafta charge you very much
so you can have all those strawberries very cheaply
but when you go to sell them to your customer
you needta put a higher price on it
because by the time you've paid your delivery man
and you've paid people to work in your shop
and had heating and lighting on
and supplied carrier bags
and things like that
and till receipts
and your wages
then you needta charge quite a lot more to the customer
but I still don't think five pounds
all the things that you've just bought from a wholesaler
sixty hundred pounds
I would imagine so
right
there we are
there's some more silvers
here

go and check the till Sweetheart
because I've forgotten
oh the idiot
there's another strawberry up there
look
the yellow one
