you're breaking it Thomas
I don't want you to do that with it please
so who is BuzzLightyear Thomas
is he a toy
no
but there's a video called ToyStory that you've watched
are you going to tell me about him

and our space trip begins

we have some satellites on board this spaceship

Mum sat down
at last she could enjoy her tea and watch her favorite program
baby panda was quiet and little panda was upstairs
little panda was in another world
he was in his room but in another world
he was lost in the make believe world of his computer
playing on his computer like Daddy does upstairs
in the real world it was getting dark
look said baby panda and pointed into the darkness
two burglars were climbing in the neighbor's window
oh no
Mum phoned the police station
hello I'm calling from five church street
burglars are breaking into number six
come quickly
baby panda kept watch at the window while Mum went to the front door to wait for the police
little panda was sitting in his room lost in his computer world
three police cars screeched to halt
blue lights flashing
what do you think they were saying

Mum opened the door and the police charged through to the back garden over the wall and in through the window of number six
the burglars heard them and ran out of the door of number six
but more police cars were coming down the street
so they ran into number five little panda's house

they burglars bounded up the stairs to the top room little panda's room
little panda was still lost in his computer world and didn't notice
the police chased up the stairs after the burglars
they burglars climbed out the window onto the roof
call the fire brigade called the police chief
we'll soon get them down with long ladders
ah now we know why the fire brigade are involved
right
what as come now
the fire engine's with long ladders roared down the street
ladders soared up to the roof and police and fire fighters began climbing
have you noticed something about the firemen
yes
they have got their helmets off „ haven't they
but what sort of people are the firemen
monkeys „ aren't they
oh look at this
as they clambered onto the front of the roof the burglars leaped off the roof onto the branches of the tall tree in the garden
surround the tree yelled the police chief
gosh after all that with the police coming and the ladders the burglars have still got away „ haven't they
oh dear
that was a big sigh
are you worried
the burglars
you wish you were watching telly
the burglars climbed across into the next tree and the next all round the garden until they were back in the first tree
then they climbed back into little panda's room
little panda still didn't notice
why did he not notice Thomas
you wish you were watching telly and nobody disturbed you
is that what little panda said

but the policemen are running up
so who's trapped
they're trapped in the middle „ aren't they
between the police and the fire
they all landed in a great heap of arms and legs and handcuffs and helmets

do you remember
what was it he said
I'll huff

I wanna know what happens because the last time we knew we ad got the police chasing them up the stairs the fire fighters chasing them down the stairs

and they all landed in a great heap of arms and legs and handcuffs and helmets
yes
oh look
the cat burglars have all got little glass on and some of them have fallen off

when the fire fighters had packed up their ladders and the burglars were being led away Mum made a fresh cup of tea
at last little panda came down
you see panda hadn't even noticed
while you've been watching your boring program
oh sorry
it's Panda saying this to his Mummy
while you've been watching your boring program I've had such an exciting game on my computer
cops and robbers he said
look cried baby panda
wowq said little panda real cops and robbers
yes real cops and robbers echoed little baby panda
look
can you see what baby panda's wearing
baby panda's wearing a police helmet „ isn't he
and his teddy bear's wearing a police helmet and panda's carrying
a cuff
they're called handcuffs
did you enjoy that
did you want it again
no
you'd like another drink
no not now darling
well that's funny because we thought that book was
we got this in the nursery library and we thought it was all about fire fighters
I suppose it was in a way but it wasn't fighting fires „ was it
so
oops darling you alright
you're sitting on the police helmet
well that'll make you very high up „ won't it
Mum sat down at last
at last she could enjoy her tea and watch her favorite program
baby panda was quiet and little panda was upstairs
little panda was in another world
he was in his room but in another world
he was lost in the make believe world of his computer
in the real world it was getting dark
look said baby panda and pointed into the darkness
two burglars were climbing the neighbors windows
Mum called the police station
hello I'm calling for five church street
burglars are breaking into there
come quickly
just sit still darling
baby panda kept watch at the window while Mum went to the front door to wait for the police
little panda was still in his room lost in this computer world
three police cars screeched to a halt blue lights flashing
Mum opened the door and the police charged through to the back garden over the wall and in through the window of number six
the burglars heard them and ran out of the front door of number six
but more police cars were coming down the street so they ran into number five little panda's house
the burglars bounded up the stairs to the top room little panda's room
little panda was still lost in his computer world
he didn't notice
the police chased up the stairs after the burglars
the burglars climbed out of the window onto the roof
call the fire brigade called the police chief
we'll soon get them down with long ladders
the fire engines with long turntable ladders roared down the street
ladders soared up to the roof and the police and fire fighters began climbing
look at this
police first and then the fire fighters
oh stop it now Thomas
you're going to fall and hurt yourself
as they clambered onto the front of the roof the burglars leaped off the back into the branches of a tall tree in the garden
surround that tree yelled the police chief
the burglars climbed across into the next tree and the next tree and the next all round the garden until they were back in the first tree
then they climbed back into little panda's room

but little panda didn't notice
I think you'd notice if somebody went into your bedroom „ don't you Thomas
won't
the burglars chased down the stairs by the fire fighters crashed into the police coming up
they all landed in a heap of arms and legs and handcuffs and helmets
when the firefighters had packed up their ladders and the burglars were being led away by the police Mum made a fresh cup of tea
at last little panda came down the stairs
while you've been watching your boring program I had such an exciting game on my computer
cops and robbers he said
look cried baby panda
wow said little panda
real cops and robbers
yes real cops and robbers echoed baby panda
look
the handcuffs
well handcuffs are sposta go on your wrist
one part of the handcuff goes on the policeman's wrist and the other part goes on your wrist
that means you're chained up to the policeman
and wherever
and wherever you go the policeman goes
to be sure that you can't get away
and even in the police car you'd still be handcuffed „ wouldn't you
yes
and other handcuff
what darling
you've got those two books that I was hiding
I'm hiding two more now
look at these
what were they bringing with them
a big box and a helmet
I think you might wanna change your helmet for this book Thomas
this is about fire fighters
are you happy with your police helmet
or would you like your yellow one
you're happy with that one
I think you need the yellow helmet for this book
oh there's big bangs outside
one of the men in this book is called Anthony
now you've got a friend called Antony which is a bit different from Anthony
but it's almost the same „ isn't it
right
well we'll read this book
it's called firefighters
now this is a lady firefighter
this is like firefighter PennyMorris „ isn't it
one day Liz was checking the hoses to make sure they were screwed tightly to the fire engine
Liz is always busy at the fire station even when there are no fire
Dan was polishing the wheels on the fire engine and Anthony was upstairs in the kitchen looking for a snack
look he as opened the fridge door
what can he see
he is always hungry
suddenly a loud noise made him jump
ringring
it was the fire alarm
Anthony slid down the pole
thud he landed hard
but the thick rubber pad on the ground cushioned his feet
ready for action
trousers are rolled over boots to save time
this way firefighters can be dressed and in the fire engine in thirty seconds
that's good „ isn't it
I think that's a jigsaw
Liz jumped
there
Liz jumped into her boots and pulled up her fireproof trousers
she checked her computer
it showed a fire at seven OakLane
in the fire engine Liz grabbed the walkietalkie
ChiefMiller we're on our way
she's talking into a walkietalkie look
that's really clever „ isn't it
putting trousers over boots to save time when you're getting dressed
because when you're getting dressed we put on your pants then your socks then your vest and then we put trousers on and then your shoes
yeah
right said the fire chief
he had gone ahead in a special fast car
I'll meet you there
Liz started the engine
as the firefighters jumped in she flipped on the sirens and lights and drove out of the fire station
the truck rushed towards the fire
it's a lady driver the fire engine
all the cars and buss stopped and waited when they heard the siren
the fire chief called Liz
I'm at the scene of the fire it's an old house that as been empty for years
but somehow
sorry someone saw a young boy playing in the garden this morning
he might be inside the house
tell Dan and Anthony to get their air tanks ready
okay Chief said Liz
I can see the smoke from here
we'll be there in two minutes
oh she's going quickly now

goodness me
Liz turned the corner into OakLane
the fire was spreading quickly
flames covered the top of the house
there was no time to lose
right there's a little bit there about the hoses
it says water comes out of a fire hose so fast it's strong enough to knock a person down
Liz attached a hose from the engine to the nearest water hydrant
a fire engine can pump water from a street hydrant to feed it's hoses
Liz and another fire fighter pointed a hose at the flames
ready called Liz
whoosh they held on tightly as water shot out
oh look breathing equipment
fire gives off deadly smoke
firefighters wear air tanks and breathing masks inside a burning building
Anthony and Dan got ready to search the house
they put on their air tank and face masks
each tank holds forty minutes of air
the boy's name is Luke
well the boy
do you remember earlier on when they said there was a fire at the house
the old house
it says it was an old house that had been empty for a long time but someone saw a young boy playing in the garden this morning
and they think he might be in the house
and they found out that the boy's name is Luke
the boy's
you have „ haven't you
at MissusPlattford's nursery
Louie
oh right
oh MercyVale you've got one called Luke
at MissusPlattford's it's Louie „ isn't it
that's right
the boy's name is Luke the chief told them
you haven't got much time
right said Anthony
he grabbed a hose let's put the wet stuff on the red stuff said Dan
that's funny
let's put the wet stuff that's the water on the red stuff that's the fire
can you remember that
let's put the wet stuff on the red stuff
Dan and Anthony ran to the back of the house
the fire was not as bad there
Dan felt the back door
if it was hot flames could leap out
it's cold said Dan
so they stepped inside
the thick black some was everywhere
Anthony shone his torch around
Luke he called
no one answered
I can hear fire upstairs said Dan
the fire had damaged the staircase
it could fall down at anytime
they climbed the steps very carefully
yes
hello Purdie
outside the stabilizers were set down on the ground
the stabilizers are like legs
they keep the truck steady as the ladder is raised
have you seen those before
the ladder went up like a telescope to the top of the house
a hose ran up the side
the firefighter on the ladder shot water down onto the fire
the flames crackled and hissed
they got smaller and then suddenly jumped even higher
inside the house the fire raged
it was hot enough to melt glass
oh dear
so that the fireman as gone up onto his ladders „ hasn't he
to jet water through the roof
Dan sprayed water onto the flames
the fire had made the hose weak
it could come down at any second said Anthony
we must find Luke
boom
a beam crashed down near them
but their helmets protected their heads
crash
quicklyq said Dan we're running out of time
right you've got your hard hat here „ haven't you
a hard firefighter's helmets are made of hard plastic
a hard brim helps to keep the sparks off their necks
oh look at this one
they came to another door but it would not open
Dan swung his axe at the door
once twice three times
it's jammed shouted Dan
the roar of the fire was so loud they could hardly hear
we'll hafta use the electric saw
there's a little part there about the firefighter's axe
it says axes have been used by firefighter's since the earliest days of firefighting
oh look
the sharp cutter there
the electric saw runs on batterys
it can cut right through a roof of a car like a can opener
right
well they've tried the axe on the door and it's not working
so it says Anthony switched on the saw
whirr
he cut a hole in the door
big enough to climb through
well I think that's the fire chief
he wears a white helmet so that everybody else knows that he's the fire chief
he's the one in charge
look he's talking into his walkietalkie
I think he's the one giving orders „ isn't it
so Dan as
Dan as cut a hole in the door big enough for him to climb through and he as gone in and he's shouting Luke
but the room was empty
suddenly the chief
that's the man in the white helmet
called get out now the roof is coming down

Dan and Anthony raced downstairs
they got out just as the roof fell in
we didn't find Luke yelled Dan
he's okay said the chief
we just found him up the road
phewq said Dan
good news
so all that time the firefighters were in that house looking for the little boy Luke and he wasn't even there „ was he
but he might have been so they hadta look
it took hours to put out all the flames
Anthony sprayed water onto the parts still glowing red
he was tired and dirty and very hungry
do you remember at the start of the story it said Antony was always hungry „ didn't it
sorry Anthony
Liz wound the hoses back onto the fire engine
at last she could rest
she felt worn out
back at the station Anthony sat down to eat at last he said
suddenly a loud noise made him jump
dinner will hafta wait smiled Dan
ringringring
guess what
another fire

poor Anthony was ever so hungry and he ad worked really hard „ hadn't he
and he was looking forward to his meal
and just as he sat down to have it the alarm went off again
so they'd hafta rush and do it all again „ wouldn't they
poor firemen
I bet it's like that some days „ don't you
I bet they're really busy
don't move the cloth
what would you rather be
a policeman or a fireman
you'd like to be both „ would you
I don't think you could be both
you might get mixed up
going to a fire wearing
Purdie's cry
oh Purdie what's the matter
is she crying
pardon
what's she saying
I can't tell what you're saying
she wants to read the book with us
she's not going to eat the book
no she's not
no she's not
let's do clap a penny
clap a clap a penny one two three
clap a clap a penny one two three

oh you're beautiful „ aren't you
you a nice boy
no if you were a fireman and a policeman Thomas you'd be going to catch burglars and you'd have your yellow helmet on
and you'd see the burglars and you'd go whoosh and you'd spray them with water from your hose
and then you'd be going to a fire and you'd get there and think oh I haven't brought my hose I've brought my handcuffs
and my truncheon and whistle
that's not a lot of good for putting fires out „ is it
what do you like best
fire engines or police cars
ice cream
do you like
you could be an ice cream seller with a ice cream van
that makes a nice noise as it goes through the streets
ice cream
oh yes
a little boy's eating an ice cream there
what song does our ice cream man play
teddy bears pooey
I think it's teddy bear's picnic „ isn't it
if you go down to the woods today
you're in for a big surprise
but better go in disguise
for every bear that ever there was
will gather there simply because
no Thomas you're going to break that
today's the day that teddy bears have their picnic
is that crane
there's this nice jigsaw here Thomas
it forms a nice caterpillar when it's made up
on one side it as got numbers
and on the other side it as got letters
clever „ isn't it
are you tired
no
what's Purdie doing
she's scratching her neck on the blocks „ isn't she
are you going to talk to Purdie for a few minutes
you asking Purdie if she'd like sweets
I don't think she does actually Thomas
she really doesn't like sweets
no
don't stand on that
it's going to break
can you find the number four
and then we can do this „ can't we
ah there's number four
what comes after four
three
no three comes before four „ doesn't it
number five
oh there's number five
that's handy
and then what
number three
I thought that was a number six and it was number nine
well I
the fire one
well you can have a look through it „ can't you
fire on what
you're just being silly now „ aren't you
where's the number one
have you pinched my number one
I think you have „ haven't you
it's a very long caterpillar
look at this
isn't it
I thought you might have done
you're hiding the pieces of jigsaw in your yellow helmet
that's cheeky „ isn't it
ThomasHenry
you're cheeky giggling away there
do you think I wouldn't notice
you are a burglar „ aren't you
I think some of this
ah I see it's on the other side
if I had handcuffs now do you know what I would do
I'd put them on you
and fasten them up for a very long time
and then you wouldn't be able to pinch all my pieces of the jigsaw
you're cheeky boy
hm

Purdie do you know what your naughty brother's doing
he's pinching the pieces of the jigsaw
what would you like to do again

it was your money box
it looks to me like your police helmet with pieces of jigsaw in
I'm terribly sorry
I got muddled up
well what would you like me to do
the number side or the letter side
well I can't start because I think you've already pinched the a and the b
well you'd better pick it up because I can't make it if some of the pieces are missing „ can I
sorry love
thank you
oops
now we've lost some more „ haven't we
we've lost the a and the c on the floor Thomas
right
g h i j for j
that's the letter of the first letter of Mummy's name
j k
where's the k
where's the
who as got the
you have
you cheeky monkey
you wait
where's that police helmet
neena
I have reason to believe that you've pinched my jigsaw
have you

right
where's those handcuffs
handcuffs on lock them
and throw away the key
into jail for you
I beg your pardon
did you say smelly bottoms
ThomasHenry since you've started nursery you're coming out with all sorts of rudeydudey things
right for saying smelly bottoms I'm giving you an extra two years in jail
that means two Christmas two birthdays you'll miss for being cheeky boy
Thomas
Thomas that will do
are you
you're clearing into the helmet „ are you
Thomas stop saying that
not now
no
no
leave the box there
what have we got in here Thomas
come on
let's have a look at this
oh what's in this box over here
what's in there
do you know what those are
they're lids from Smarties „ are they
would you like some Smarties
no I don't know what Purdie wants
Purdie as just been fed and she's still making a lot of noise „ isn't she
who's smacking bottoms
well if you're smacking my bottom you're not having any Smarties
no
I don't know
no
there's nothing in there now
it's empty „ isn't it
this has got something in it because this is rattling
I think it might be Smarties
it says Smarties on the box „ doesn't it
you can if you over there
I think it's Smarties
yes
they're little chocolate sweeties „ aren't they
mind the books Thomas
well you get
pardon
table and chair sweeties
what do you mean
well you usually get Smarties in tubes and when they come in tubes they have lids like this
but those Smarties are in a little box
oh look
and I've just got the lids
have you seen on top of the Smartie lids
we've been saving these
they all have a different letter „ don't they
can you see them
well I think it's just something they do on the top of the Smartie lids so that you can play with the lids afterwards and spell things „ can't you

look at these
these are nice
these are nice letters „ aren't they
yes
these are letters of the alphabet made of wood and painted
and they've each got something on them
a picture
and I would imagine the picture perhaps starts with the first letter of the alphabet that they're showing
I can't see a letter a though
can you
I can see a b
because what's there painted on the b
b for butterfly
oh yes
there's the a
and do you know what it is
it's a snake
we've had this before in books „ haven't we
the snake is the adder
that's the a
b for butterfly
and what do you think the c will be
I would imagine it's a pussy cat

I'm going to go and have a Smartie
I can see a purple one that
I shall pinch that and eat it
mm
I can see two brown ones a yellow one and a blue one on the floor
I shall have those ones in a minute
I'm going to get the policeman's helmet
come and find you
what are you eating under the table
how come you found a Smartie under there

where as the blue one gone that I saw a minute ago
oh no it's still there
you want me to turn my head here and when the clock goes to the bottom what

are you pinching
well if I close my eyes I can't tell when the clock goes to the top or the bottom „ can I
will you shout
I'll bet you'll shout when you've eaten all the Smarties and pinched a few more letters
is it
oh well no more letters have gone missing
there are twenty six letters of the alphabet and I've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
have you pinched six of my letters
you've got an a a b a c an f n and an o
that's six letters missing
you must think you're PostmanPat collecting letters
what's the matter Purdie
would you like something to eat Poppet
well I'm going to feed Purdie because Thomas is just being too quiet
he's up to no good
little boys who sit under the table and are very good
not very good very quiet are up to no good I think
what do you think Purdie
yes Purdie agrees with me
Purdie thinks you're probably being a little bit naughty
em how many letters have I got now
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
I shall count them again in a minute
caught you
caught you
there you are Purdie
I'll feed you
there are a lot of bangs outside
it's a month too early
this is ridiculous
it's a good job Purdie can't hear very well „ isn't it
because they tell you you've got to keep pets in bonfire night
and if they're going to start this early people won't have kept their pets in because they're not expecting it „ are they
it's quite cold as well today „ isn't it
how many letters have I got left now
two four six eight ten eleven
Thomas Lastname I'm arresting you for having all those letters of the alphabet
no don't do that
pardon
you're hiding a blue Smartie
where

you're cheeky
where
there's a brown one there that I can see
I'm going to put these lids back in the Smartie box
that's a good idea „ isn't it
the emptys of Smarties and we put the lids in
a b c d
have you had some of these as well
goodness me
it's not as if they're very
you can't even see the fireworks
we can just hear big bangs „ can't we
nothing to look at
it's a bit much

I've got ten letters of the alphabet left now Thomas
where are the other sixteen
have you pinched sixteen letters
I think that's very cheeky
you not talking to me now
I think you're too busy eating Smarties as well „ aren't you
you feel a bit sick
good
yes good
because that will teach you
do you really feel a bit sick
is that why you've gone quiet
when you eat things do you feel sick Thomas
I think Purdie's probably going to
no don't shout at Purdie
I think she's going to feel a bit sick in a minute because she as eaten a very big tea „ hasn't she
she as eaten a really big meal
yes
oh don't touch that
that's Daddy's keyboard
don't touch that
you must not touch that at all
he'll have a fit if he sees you touching that
