right
yes
putting his big digger up very high
that's the
his level
shovel you mean

oh yeah
oh I see

BobtheBuilder
I've just let Purdie come in
right
are you going to pop your tabard back on
you've washed your hands „ haven't you
do you
it makes a good noise that „ doesn't it
right
pussy would you like feeding
that's quite enough and then she'll be happy
come on puss
there you are
now Thomas
we're going to ice those cakes that we made the other day „ aren't we
no
I don't think we can dig anything up
what we needta do now
well
this is chocolate „ isn't it
we made icing
do you remember when we made icing
well that's in the fridge
well
no
this is cooking chocolate
we're going to break three squares of chocolate into this bowl
look
listen
underneath there's a bowl of very hot water that's just come out of the kettle
so I'm putting chocolate in the top bowl and that will melt
you mustn't tip that up
hm
it smells good
now in the meantime let's get that icing we made the other day
oh yes
when it as melted
right
this might be a bit stiff now cause we did this the other day „ didn't we
what day was it Sunday
well we've got to melt it first „ haven't we
was it Sunday when we made these cakes
it was „ wasn't it
today
well no
we've just got them ready today to ice „ haven't we
don't sniff please
right
there we are
does that feel nice
right
now let's put this white icing on the big one „ shall we
there aren't as many left as when we made them „ are there
because what as happened to some of the ones
hm
I don't think it's that
it's that some of them have been eaten „ don't you
since we made them

why are you looking like that
have you eaten any buns
no
you wouldn't do „ would you
you wouldn't do that
no
course you wouldn't
robbers do that „ do they
are you a little robber
oh is that when the cakes were eaten
cause we made quite a lot of cakes „ didn't we
because we used little bun cases
course you can
yes
that's it
then in a minute I've got to go and find some sweeties
what
how to find sweeties
I thought you might
they're probably a bit dry these buns now as well „ do you think
gosh there's a lot of ice on that one
look at that one
it's overflowing „ isn't it
that's it
here's that for that one
chocolate doesn't seem to be doing a very good job of melting „ does it
it's just sitting there in the bowl not doing anything
oh
Purdie's crying now
is she lost in the dark
when you've finished but we've not finished yet
well why don't I just before you do that
don't do anything with the icing yet
let me move these that you've iced to the back of the baking tray and then we'll put the ones we haven't iced at the front
wasn't very much at all that „ was it
you could try practicing your name in icing on those buns
hm
perhaps not
what do you think „ perhaps not
perhaps not

just a minute
do you
that's it
you need more on your spoon I think love „ don't you
no
you're not licking that
hey
you cheeky monkey
I know we've not as many cakes to ice as we made but we've still got a good few without icing on
now don't be licking this spoon yet you cheeky monkey
Thomas don't
thank you blister
who's mister blister
is he

doesn't sound nice „ does it
a blister on your foot
blister on your foot
well it wasn't yesterday love it was quite a long time ago
you went to the
you went to the doctor's „ didn't you
it was on your toe „ do you remember
cause we know
well we noticed on your foot and we didn't know what it was on your toe and it was all infected so we daddy took you to the doctor
on his own and in fact it was the nurse who saw you and the nurse was quite cross and said we should have taken you before
and she said we hadta take you out the next day and when I took you back we saw a different nurse who didn't know why we had taken you
so there you go
I don't know why we had taken you really
that looks like a heart shape that one
doesn't it
right
I think we will eat the
hm
I think we're
you can lick it
we're nearly at the stage where you can lick the spoon
I'll just scrape this round
now are there any with white icing on that look like they need a little bit more icing
what are you doing
you're underneath the baking tray pinching all the icing that's running past
is it dropping off
hm
does that taste good Tom
you'll probably make yourself sick tonight by eating all these
there you are
would you like to lick that now
what I'm going to do I'm going to
I'm going to pop that in the microwave for a couple of seconds just to see if we can melt it quickly
we've got to be careful because it can go hard
back in the microwave
and when the chocolate's ready we can do the chocolate one
I'll just put this in for another ten seconds
don't pick any of the buns and then we've got to choose some sweeties to put on top
does that sound like a good idea
Mr Thomas Henry
hm
don't sniff please
it just needs a little longer „ doesn't it
a fraction longer
there isn't very much chocolate actually to melt
there we are
I think that as done the trick
steady
tastes of hm „ does it
banana
why does it taste of banana
all right
no more now
let's put a drop of chocolate on these ones
right Tom
before we do you stand still I'm going to get a tissue and wipe your nose and your hands
put that down please
right
stand still
Thomas
oy
right
no more doing that
let's wipe your hands as well please
no
you're not doing any more anything now
pop that chocolate on there
here you go do you wanna do it on your own
that's it
a squadge
that's right
oh
you've got sleeves on it's a bit thicker than the icing this chocolate
it as melted but it's a bit thick „ isn't it
there
right
do you wanna do the others
shall I go and
you want your feet resting
okay
what do you need
you need the chocolate to eat
I'm sure in a minute we can treat ourselves to one of them „ don't you

oh that's a nice one
which bun would you like a blue one putting on

we'll hafta be quick now because the icing's setting and the chocolate's setting and
oops
that as gone on the floor
where as it gone
there we are
right
we've got to be ever so quick with the chocolate ones really quick now Tom
because they're too late to put things on if we don't do it quick
do the chocolate ones first please because the other icing's a bit runnier
let's put something on
that's it
shall I put this orange one up here
well I tell you what
yes
I was going to say we could always use a little bit of that white icing there
to stick things „ couldn't we
how's that
then it doesn't matter if it as melted
no
not yet
we haven't decorated all of the cakes yet
no
we can't eat until the job's done Thomas
do you need some more sweets
you've got a lot on that one „ haven't you
how many things have you got on there
three
right
here we are some more smarties and a couple more jelly sweets

if you've licked your fingers you've got to come and get your hands washed
ah you have I saw you

that's it
those Rolo ones look really nice „ don't they
well you can have one that you chose then we'll save one for Daddy and Mummy will have one
well that looks nice
look
two eyes and a little bit of chocolate there that looks like a nose and can you see it looks like a smile at the bottom
hm
it is a smile „ isn't it
no
don't put any more on that one because there are others without anything on
is it
more chocolate
do you mean more smarties
when we made those cakes the big cakes
there we go that's the end of the tube
we've put them all in big cases these have been made in little cases „ haven't they
you must've just licked some icing because you've just wiped your hands all on your own
don't do that
all right do I put a one a red one on that please
okay
that one's got two smarties
right now
let's put
we've no more sweets now so we've got to put these on the other buns without icing on otherwise some will have none
no
put some on ones without anything on
just one on each Thomas
no
because we're going to run out
there aren't going to be any smarties left
that's it
one on each of the others
if you've any left you can put another one on
look at that one it as risen right in the middle „ hasn't it
yes

excuse me
all right
well go and sit in your chair then please
come and sit in your chair now
and shall I have this one
and shall we save that other one for Daddy
I'm going to sit on the floor
hm
that's nice you've got icing all round your mouth
this is a treat sitting down eating little buns with chocolate icing and Rolo on top and when I'm sitting on this stool
oh look Purdie as come
do you know what I can see
rows and rows of little buns with smarties on top
that's nice „ isn't it
mass of Rolos
I think there's only one more left with a Rolo on and that's for Daddy „ isn't it
are the buns nice or are they a bit hard these small ones
they've probably dried out a bit cause we made them on Sunday „ didn't we
hm
very nice
are you tired now
are you a tired boy
we've had quite a busy day today „ haven't we
sit up properly Tom please
do you
oh well
you'll hafta stay there then
a shame really because all these buns need eating but if you're stuck you'll hafta stay there
and you can get down when we've eaten them all
are we allowed another one
which one would you like me to have
this one
I'll have this because it's nearest „ how's that
this has got white icing on and a little jelly sweet
hm
the small buns are really quite dry now „ aren't they
it's a pity because I was thinking
hello ThomasHenry
I was thinking
I thought these would be nice for your party but not if they're going to be so dry
it's keeping us quiet eating these „ isn't it
hm
nice
yum
well I think that was rather nice
the one that as just gone in my tummy
it had white icing on it and a little jelly sweet
but it as gone
do you think I've got room in my tummy
will you choose another small one for me please
not that one
that one's Daddy's
that one
hm
what's this
a chocolate iced on with a little orange jelly sweet on it
that's very nice and then no more
mind you these tiny ones are only the equivalent of one big one
oops
the jelly sweet fell off
I don't think we were quite quick enough
with our chocolate icing putting the decorations on it set before we we ad decorated it „ didn't it
if you find that little orange sweet you can have it
hm
I'm quite sure
I will
going under
what have you found
a cone
right
look for the jelly sweet nothing else because your hands are a bit sticky don't
play with anything else
we're looking for a little orange
oh it's here Thomas
here you are
I'll put a little bit of white icing that as fallen off the table
here you are I've stuck it on top of your bun
hm
that's nice
we're being very piggy „ aren't we
eating all these buns
it's funny that the icing when it doesn't go to the bottom of the bun and it leaves a sort of semi circle at the bottom it looks like a smile „ doesn't it
I think when we've had this we ad better not have any more because we're not going to eat our tea
no no
you've not eaten that one yet
no
no
all you really want is the sweetie off the top „ isn't it
we're going to have pasta for tea tonight
would you like that
no
why
you do
you can have sausages with it
yes
put pasta with it
no
are you going to eat your Mummy
I don't know
I noticed that this morning
I don't know darling
there's a big scratch down my arm and the only thing I can think of is that perhaps I've picked Purdie up and she as scratched me
or perhaps I've caught my arm in something
Thomas come here
come here please
come on
we're going to put these buns in the tin now
right
can you help
that's for Daddy so we could take that up for Daddy „ couldn't we
when he comes home
how's that
right
we'll put this to one side for Daddy
are you still eating that one
I think you needta take the paper off poppet please
I don't think it will be very nice to eat the bun paper „ do you
I don't think it will be nice to eat the bun paper
do you think so
hm
I don't think that'll be very pleasant
hm
will it
oh a green smartie as just fallen down I think it must've fallen off one of the chocolate buns

no
I've popped a little bit of white icing on it and I've popped it in the bun tin
sorry
the chocolate ones with the little smartie on
look
look to me like little Easter nests they remind me of little Easter
well it was that green one but I've stuck it back on and popped it in the bun tin
there we are
how is that
is that fine
right
in this Tweenies part that we have the sweeties in shall we put that little bun for Daddy
there we are
that looks nice „ doesn't it
right
the lid's going on the tin now
oh good grief
I think we can pop some of these bun cases in the bin
well that was nice
are you hiding from Purdie
are you a little bit frightened that she's going to eat your cake
I don't think she I don't think Purdie really likes cakes „ do you
I don't think it's the sort of thing she would pinch from you Thomas
you needn't panic
what are you doing over there
you haven't pinched another bun „ have you
no
I didn't think you would
not my Thomas
when the come out I'll wipe your hands
and then we can have a little break while I tidy away
and then I've got another job that you can have a go at
well we have just had a little break we had a little sit down and eating some cakes „ didn't we
you didn't have any black currant juice
does that mean you want some now
what do you say
oh well you don't get any then „ do you
no
I don't get anything unless somebody asks nicely
please may I have
no
not doing it now
no
right
let's have a
no
let's have a little break
right
just wait here please
wait here
and then we can do a few more jobs in a minute when I've tidied up
how about that
right Tom
are you going to help Mummy do this
of course you can kiss me
well you'll need your sleeves rolled up this is why I thought we've do this while we've still got aprons after doing the icing because I've washed up
now this plant pot as been outside and it's very dirty and you see these little things here
they're weeds so I'm going to just pull those out
those are little weeds there
that's it
those tiny green things
now in this pot here
oops
sorry love
I'm ever so sorry
that was an accident
now we've got three plants here
ones we bought in Didsbury today
look
no
no
working on the kitchen floor it's not ideal for gardening but it's
yes
it says Homebaseq
it's obviously where we bought the shovel from „ isn't it
the little trowel
now I've got these three spring plants that I was going to put around this silvery plant
I don't know what this silvery plant's called but it looks a little bit dead on top „ doesn't it
so we'll put
no because that's not a dead leaf I'm just pulling off these two dead ones at the top
that's the dead bit
that's right
okay
and I thought a couple of these nice spring plants I don't know whether they're called Primulas or Primroses I always get mixed up
nothing at the moment
will you just sit a little further back please Thomas
you're too close
that's it
you pick that up then
look
this plant at the front door as always looked a bit tired
so I've brought these little spring plants to liven it up and now I've got it inside and looked at it properly can you see round here we've got some spring plants obviously from last year in the same tub
that are just starting to flower „ aren't they
shooting eh
we're not digging anything up Thomas
we're planting
we're putting new things into
do you think
do you think those would look pretty in there
how about
which two together because I don't think there's room for all three
we want that one in and which one shall we put with it „ this one
or this one
that one
right
well we're not actually digging up Tom
we're just going to
no
we don't wanna dig up
just planting up are you
right
I'm slicing up this big cheese
watch your feet
look at all the weeds in this little plant
now if we just stick that in there like that „ can't we
well we're not digging Thomas
we don't needta dig at all
we're just planting
what's it for love
that's right
we'll just put it in there
watch your feet
will you sit further back I don't wanna go through your foot
look
there's a little wooden worm in there
look
look in there
can you see
can you see that
yeah
tiny worm
Perhaps it's really a bit bigger but it's just hidden from us
no
we're not digging anything
now we needta put some of this soil round
that's all from outside that's compost I've just got it from the bag of compost round at the back of the shed
what
a bag of compost

well it's a great big bag I think actually your Grandad got it from B Q „ didn't he one day
do you remember that
well I've just gone out with a little bowl and got enough compost in the bowl for potting this
are you alright
can't you
do you wanna see a bit more of me
that's nice
right
now this is the pink plant that's going here
no Tom
I can't work with you on my back will you go round this way please
well you've just come from that way
you can't climb on my back darling while I'm doing this
and then do you know what we're going to do in a minute when we've done this
please Thomas
move back
we're going to get an apple and cut it in half
and plant the seeds
that's right
we'll use one of those little Tweenie's yoghurt pots because we seem to have a lot of those at the moment
what have you got
right
will you move them right out of the way I don't want anything that's going to get soil on it Thomas
put them down please
that's a good boy
yeah
now how does that seem
I haven't covered up those other plants we've just discovered „ have we
do you think they look nice in there Thomas
now we needta get these Tweenie pots
there's one on the welsh dresser up there
right
that's it now
if you would like to get some compost with that trowel and put it into that little pot
and I'll wash my hands and find another little pot for us
that's right
very carefully
very good
good boy
I don't think you'll need very much to fill a little pot like that „ will you
do you
oh yes
now there's two more pots here
ah
I tell you what before I fill them up
we've done one with soil
don't do any more just this
no Thomas
I'm going to get this very sharp stick that
this is what Mummy tests cakes with to see if they're baked
I'm going to make
well the soil won't fall out because the hole's not very big but when we start to water them we need little drainage holes
one two three four
yes
I think I'll do four in this one
there we are
if you would like to put some in those two pots
don't fill it very full darling
only about half way up
not as much as that
right
okay
now do the other one
just do it over here so it's not going everywhere Thomas
you're sitting too close
no don't
no
you must stay where you are
you can't walk round the kitchen filling up
Thomas
come on
concentrate
right
use two hands
use one to hold the pot
no not
that's it
that's better
right
now my hands are clean and I've got an apple here
right
no more compost in there
that's it
that's it finished now
move right over there please
well we can eat it later „ can't we
I'll just give the apple a rinse
yes
right now
well we'll have a snack later
now we've got to keep this well away from the soil if we are going to eat it
this sharp knife
right
one apple
cut it in two that's two halves
cut it again and we've got four quarters
now look at the pips
let's get the pips out
that's it
how many pips
have you never touched pips before
right
how many pips have you got now
three
there's four
right
no
just leave them where they were
just leave them there don't touch them any more please
no
you mustn't touch the apple
cause you've not washed your hands after touching the soil
right
we'll get another apple because I'm sure we'll eat it later
I'll give it a rinse
well yes cause now we've cut them up we'll eat them later so
we'll do the same
right
what am I doing now
I'm cutting it
two halves
that's two quarters „ isn't it
and when I've done it again we've got
four quarters
you clever boy
now how many pips
one two three four five
that's good

we've got to divide it up between the pots „ Thomas
just put three in each one please
that's too full we'll hafta tip some compost out
right
put three in that one

I've put one in
two three
very good
right
we get another pot now and put three in that one
one two three
now two pots can have one more in each
just two pots can have one more
that one and that one
very good
now we'll just move the apples well out of the way
now let's push these seeds down
you push the seeds down
that's right
not down to the bottom but just further down
how's that
you're planting them
very good
now we needta get a tiny bit more compost out of there
well let's use what's on the floor with your hands
just scoop it up with your hands and then we won't put it right to the top but nearly to the top
that's a good boy
no
we ad better wash them
we will hafta water these in a few minutes
oh are you
you're only saying that because you've seen some apples seeds
now which was the pot without the holes in the bottom
that was this one
let me get that sharp stick and we'll put some holes in the bottom of that one
the easiest way is if we do it like this
what's the matter
what have you done
cut your toe on the radiator
don't
where's your sock
you've taken your sock off „ haven't you
why did you take your sock off
because it was wet

ThomasHenry
you rude boy
you very rude child I heard you
right
would you like to put the three pots onto that tray
what as the tray got a picture of on it
what sort of flowers „ do you know
sunflowers
daffodils
very good
well I think that's a bit sharp to play with „ isn't it
are you
oh yeah
are you counting up sheep
it looks like LittleBoPeep
what's it called
Elaya
no
but she has a crook
that's the word
a crook
like a walking stick „ isn't it
but she uses it for pulling her sheep back
there
what do think to that
was that a good day's work
right
no
don't do that because it'll damage the kitchen sink and it's too sharp to play with
right
I think now we hafta go and get our hands washed „ don't you
and tidy up
all right
we can eat the apples
okay
say bye bye for now we'll be back later „ won't we
back later
bye bye
bye
come on let's have a little look at this
are you looking at your shadow in the sun

there's not really a lot of sun today „ has there
well I don't know
it was nice this it was quite nice and sunny and warm this morning then we had showers
about a tree in the jungle
well actually it's called TheLittleTree and it was really a book you got for Christmas but there's no reason why we shouldn't look at it now „ is there
called TheLittleTree
it was the middle of winter and in a deep dark forest a little tree stood in a clearing
there was the sound of rustling in the leafs and some tiny wood mice appeared with brightly colored toadstools
what are the toadstools
yes
but it says and rabbits came with strawberries
look
what are they carrying the strawberries in
