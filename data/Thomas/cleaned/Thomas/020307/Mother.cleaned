Purdie
Purdie went out last night and didn't come home „ did she
half past two this morning Mummy was looking for her
and she wasn't there
but then when we got up this morning she came out of a tree
I think it's a bit hot for Purdie at the moment so
she must have found a little cool spot and gone to sleep and decided to stay there for the night
Mummy was worried „ wasn't she
are you snoring
is that what Purdie must have been doing last night
anyway at least she came home „ didn't she
right
what does Mummy needta do now

so you can talk to me because I'm going to have a cup of tea and a piece of toast
as soon as I've done this you can talk to me and we can watch something like that later on

because that's a bag of feather cushions
and they're fairly new but
Mummy can't cope with the feathers
so we've hadta buy some different cushions
no
I couldn't manage the feathers
so Mummy as bought some different cushions to go inside the covers
and these can go in the back „ can't they
and somebody who likes feather cushions can have them rather than wasting them because they're in good condition „ aren't they
they've not been used in fact at all
so I've just put a little note on the back to say that
now where's that white plastic bag gone
oh here we are
do you think Mummy's black bag will go inside that white bag
oops

and now I'll put that little bag of clothes on top
a big truck's coming

there's lotsof crackling of plastic bags this morning
there's an aeroplane going over very fast „ isn't there

the jam or the cheese
look
Mummy's just going to put this outside Thomas
in case the van comes
because we don't wanna miss it after all that „ do we
yes
it might not be a very big truck Thomas
I think it's just a lady in a van collecting this one but we've got another bag that came through the door the other day
and that's for next Friday
yellow boxes
oh I know what you mean
yes
well it wasn't the postman but somebody came round and they posted through the letterbox „ didn't they
a plastic bag
that's right
it went bang as it landed through the door because the letterbox flap banged „ didn't it
and they were asking if we had anything so we'll see if we can find anything else and put it out next week
and that probably will be a big truck coming to pick that up
bye bye

oops a dear
what's going on
oh you're still asking me what's going on from the other day „ aren't you
and I really don't know Thomas
we saw lotsof police vans and a police car
but we don't know what was going on „ do we
we were having our meal outside and suddenly three police vans and a police car came racing down and they stopped outside „ didn't they
the icecream van
I think he ad just gone past
I can't remember
and we looked out
and there was a man walking along the road with crutches
he had crutches „ didn't he
he was limping
and one or two neighbors were standing there but we hadn't a clue what was going on
nobody seems to know
and Mummy kept saying what's going on
and you kept saying
what's going on
and we still don't know what's going on „ do we
when Daddy came home we said we don't know what's going on
what darling
oh dear
he as got a blue nose „ hasn't he
you've moved some strawberries now and you can see the bottom of the bowl
and it's the Kellogg's tiger „ isn't it
the big brown bear
yes
he's like a big brown bear
but it's a tiger and he as got a blue nose
and those are the three Rice Crackle and Pop men from the RiceKrispies „ aren't they
Snap Crackle and Pop Mummy means
not Rice Crackle and Pop
mm
you've eaten all the strawberries
a big brown bear
don't shout
I can't see a brown bear
oh on Tuesday we're going on a teddy bear's picnic „ aren't we
would you like some apple
two pears
does that mean you'd like an apple
chocchocs please
I don't think we've got any chocolate Thomas
shall we peel this apple
oh dear
what's the matter
you'd like a little bit of peel
there you are
you can't have the apple till I've done this for you Thomas
stop being whingy
hey that will do
going to start throwing things around now „ are we
well if it makes you feel better
I think it's silly
more please
I'm going to cut it up for you
you should not by now
look
how many apples do we have a day
you have at least two
so you should know that everyday we peel them and core them and take the pips out
what a sillybilly
you're not talking now
you're just whinging „ aren't you
in a minute
can you see the man getting into his car
it's Stephen
can you see him
there we are
that's all the pieces of apple
what do you want
your trains
your choo choos
there you are
you like to play with your toy train at the table „ don't you
there you are
so you can load the apple up into the back of the train
there's the man
but listen
that's the man that rides the horse
the train driver has gone
I don't know where he as gone
I think perhaps we've had him outside when we've been eating and he as just gone for a little walk
yes
the little man as gone for a little walk I think
do you think he as had a walk to the chip shop
what I'll do
I'll just have a look in the Lego box because I think the man who drives the racing car might very well be able to drive the train
there we are
this is the racing car driver but shall we see if he can drive the train
I think he can
look at that
ohgosh if he can drive a fast car he might be able to drive a train
we'll see „ shall we
but when we go outside later on we must look for the train driver
yes
vroom vroom
no
what does the train say
I think you're saying vroom vroom because you know it's the racing driver rather than the train driver
because the train says „ doesn't it
is the apple nice
it's very quiet this morning „ isn't it
what happened at music time yesterday
did we hafta be very quiet
you could be noisy as well but when he told us to be quiet we hadta be quiet „ didn't we
did you do some marching
that's right
stop and go
we did some marching and he told us when we hadta stop marching and when we could go
so we're going to go to music club on Friday and the following Friday and I think that's probably it then
two more Fridays
and then on Tuesday we've got the teddy bear's picnic at the toddler group and then that's the last toddler group until September
oh dear dear
but the Beehive in Didsbury that keeps going all Summer
so when
this one for the park
that's right
so when we went to the park yesterday
with Jo
yes
yes
we did go with Jo „ didn't we
I was thinking we only walked back with her
but we did go with Jo
so we can keep going there every Friday afternoon because that's open all Summer
in fact it doesn't just hafta be Friday afternoon
it can be any afternoon
we normally only go on a Friday because it's the only day Mummy as been free
but if we're not going to toddler group on a Tuesday and we're not going to music group on a Friday
we might be able to go to the park another day as well
what do you think to that
see see saws
Mummy still can't sing „ can she
I don't think you've said see saws before „ have you
oh dear
has the train tipped up and all the apples fallen out of the truck at the back
I don't think there's actually see saws though Thomas
at the Beehive
there's the big thing that you can walk up some steps and come down a slide and then you can walk up the steps and go along a platform and play with a steering wheel and look at some numbers and some noughts cross and come down a different slide
and there's lotsof tricycles and bikes „ aren't there
and inside you can paint or you can play with toys
there's slide inside
but I think you're thinking of the bee
it's not really a see saw but it's a rocking bee „ isn't it
and you can get on it and you can rock backwards and forwards like the see saw
are you going to sing see saw
come on then
no
the scream is from RowRowRowTheBoat
if you see a crocodile don't forget to scream
oh there we are especially for Dimitra
just buy her some paracetamol when we next see her for her headache
and Elaine
you'll be giving them a headache screaming like that
oh no

no
that's very good
what about Baa baa black sheep

it's Saturday morning
it's quite early „ isn't it
oh dear
the docdoc
sore knee
do you think you needta go to the docdoc with your sore knee
no
I think your sore knee's nearly better
when you went to Grandma and Granddad's
Granddad put some of his special cream on from a blue tube
do you remember that white cream
because he looked at your knee and said
dear dear dear
what a mess
you stayed with Grandma and Granddad at the seaside „ didn't you
sore knee Nana
yes
you told Nana all about your sore knee because you ad actually done it the day that we went to stay with them
and last week and the week before you fell over that many times Thomas
I lost count
I know you fell in the park and you fell going to Jo's house
well you fell at Jo's house as well
and then you fell on Tuesday at toddler group „ didn't you

aah everybody else said
oh poor Thomas
and we went inside and Mummy washed your knee „ didn't she
wash knee
and you weren't very happy „ were you
when I washed your knee
you didn't like to feel that water on your knee
and then when we got to Grandma's house you were telling them all about it
and AuntyTricia came round and you showed her your poorly knee
and you got all upset again „ didn't you
yes
because it brought it all back to you
shall I give you a kiss now
oh Thomas I do love you
