you don't need my dressing gown on
you've put it on the floor
I'd prefer it back in where it was Thomas
you've hurt your foot like Mummy
yes
Mummy as got a very poorly foot „ hasn't she
and you
you've got a poorly foot as well
like me
oh Mummy's poorly foot isn't funny
are you
why are you putting all your toys in your pocket
oh Thomas you've got an awful lot of toys in some very small pockets
let me do your dressing gown ties up
otherwise you're going to trip over them
let me let me just fasten the belt please
yes
we're both in our dressing gowns „ aren't we
yes
well yours is full of toys
mine isn't
a lot of things
well it's quite late at night Thomas „ isn't it
you should be in bed really
oh I don't think you'll get your fire engine in the pocket
that's silly
what have we been doing
sitting down
oh we've been taking the decorations down
helping Daddy
that's right
yes
Daddy as taken the tree down „ hasn't he
oh it's very
it's very bare in here „ isn't it
we've still got this pretty red plant though
look Thomas
that's quite Christmassy „ isn't it
but all the decorations hafta come down tomorrow
and seeing as Mummy's at work all day and won't be home till late I think we did right to get them down tonight „ don't you
and what have we done
we've had a walk right round Streetname and Streetname and Streetname looking at Christmas trees and lights
we were saying goodnight to them „ weren't we
it was better to go out when it was dark because
you saw the moon shining in the sky
we saw some very bright stars
they were lovely „ weren't they
to look at
you're putting your PostmanPat van in your pocket
Mummy and Daddy have been taking down Christmas decorations and you've been helping but you've also tipped this toy box out again
oh look at Purdie
she's sitting on the stairs watching us
can you see here through the bannister
up there
look
peeping
she's peeping
shh
and all the cards
all the cards that were blutacked to the door
and the bannister
they've all come down „ haven't they
this when we went for our little walk outside
it as all gone
we said goodbye to all the Christmas trees „ didn't we
and all the lights
we kept saying
no
Thomas don't shout now please
Thomas don't shout
Daddy's upstairs „ isn't he
no
I'm not cross
I'm just saying please don't shout
well I'd rather sit over there because I've got a glass of wine over there
is that alright
in this one
ah but I wanna sit in that one

oh please may I sit in the other chair
I can hear Daddy snoring
can you hear him
he as stopped now
I think he heard us say that
he as stopped
he was snoring very loudly „ wasn't he
well Daddy as had a busy day and he's tired
and you had a little sleep „ didn't you
before
and now you're rearing to go
which is just as well
what darling
where
what can you see
a berry on the top
what do you mean a berry on the top
oh I know
I know what you mean
because you call
when we make SantaClaus a glass of sherry you called it a berry „ didn't you
so you can see that glass now you think it's sherry but it's not
it's red wine
so when you're saying a berry on the top you're meaning a glass of red wine on top of the mantelpiece „ aren't you
oh the mantelpiece looks very sad Thomas
now
because all the cards have gone
and we had little gifts „ didn't we
up there and candles
and they've gone
and now I can look at the flowers and they've died as well
oh it's sad
it's sad
the cards have come down
and Holly the carol singer
she as moved as well
she's in the kitchen now
yes
waiting to go in a box
so when we went for our walk we had one final look at all the trees
you did hear a firework
yes
it was quite unusual „ wasn't it
to hear a firework because it wasn't fireworks
a big scream in the church
a big rocket
we saw a rocket in the road „ didn't we
I think it might have been UncleBrian's
when we went for a walk earlier on we saw that rocket because UncleBrian let off some rockets
no
leave Purdie
Thomas leave Purdie alone
don't you dare touch Purdie with those ladders or you'll be in trouble
Thomas
come on Purdie
would you like to come and sit on my knee because Thomas doesn't wanna sit with me
you come and sit with me sweetheart
oh that's nice „ isn't it
Purdie's a little fish
hello little fish
do you remember when we were looking at your Christmas teddy yesterday and it had a little red velvet nose
and I said feel that
now you feel Purdie's fur
she's so soft and silky
she feels like velvet „ doesn't she
I'm not sure if Purdie's as smooth as silk
or whether she looks like velvet
is she like a fish
she's probably enjoying that because you're stroking her nicely „ aren't you
oh you love Purdie really „ don't you
oh she's lovely
and Purdie as seen a lot of Christmass „ hasn't she
oh that's nice
you've given Purdie your little yellow car
I'll hold it for her
I'll put it there
she can see it
oh yes
she likes that
you like that little yellow car „ don't you Puss
yes
oh a traffic sign for you as well Purdie
look
yes
she can see it
yes
she can see it
oh no Thomas
don't start posting toys on Purdie's head
she doesn't like that
thank you
that's your yellow car that Granddad bought in Spain „ isn't it
do you remember that
that's another thing now that you've tipped all your toys out on the floor I'm seeing toys I haven't seen for a very long time
what's not good
shh
don't shout
what as stopped
the snoring
I can hear him snoring
listen
I hope this is on tape and then I can prove it to daddy that he snores
we can hear him when we're downstairs and he's upstairs with the bedroom door shut
what a noisy Daddy
Purdie's not crying „ is she
Purdie's probably very happy because she's sitting on my knee and I'm stroking her
and you're being very gentle „ aren't you
you're giving her a stroke as well
that's what she likes you see Thomas
she'll stay
do you remember the nursery rhyme about the pussy cat
why I said pull her tail your eyes lit up then
cheeky
and that's what you do you play very gently
you play gently
you don't pull her tail and you don't drive her away
and Purdie and I very gently will play
I love little Purdie
her coat is so warm
and if I don't hurt her she'll do me no harm
so I'll not pull her tail or drive her away
and Purdie and I'll very gently will play
no more
no
I'm not going to sing anymore
but you just take that little nursery rhyme in and think about „ won't you
think about not pulling her tail and not driving her away
and gently playing with her
what are you singing
she's licking me
yes
is she going to lick you too
ah lick me too Purdie
please
no
she
no
she might do in a minute
you see Purdie's being very gentle with you because her tongue's very rough
if you lick yourself it's nice
if Purdie licked you she as got a really rough tongue
really rough
it is
what's the matter with
I think she as got a sore place on her head
let's have a look
oh dear
something must have bumped her
yes
just look at this
look
she as got
oh no
don't
don't touch because she might
she as got a little scab
a little scar
somebody as caught her
ah poor Purdie
she as got a little scratch above her eye
somebody picked her up
right darling
what have you seen
your tape recorder

I think you needta press something else

would you like Purdie to say something
well hold the microphone
that's lovely
we won't be able to sing Christmas songs and carols anymore either

I'm really quite sad Thomas
I don't think I've ever been this sad when all the decorations have come down
we've had
I know the cards
we've had such a lot of fun „ haven't we
I think this is why we're so sad
everything as been wonderful
all those weeks coming up to Christmas when
yes
we were talking about Santa

Mummy's going to move now because Purdie's getting too comfortable here „ aren't you sweetheart

pardon
oh it's a paint
yes
when it was on the tree I remember you took one of the tassles „ didn't you
and pretended it was a paintbrush
there
we've got to just be careful with the ends
this is the thing Thomas
I feel awful keeping telling you to be careful
but Christmas decorations aren't toys „ are they
and if we wanna enjoy them each year we've got to treat them very carefully and gently
this is why we've got to pack them up nicely tomorrow „ haven't we
you're painting
you're pretending to paint with the tassel
oh and look there's another candle here
this is another one
it's called Festive Spice

this was the decoration that was made of all the fruit berries
it's pretty „ isn't it
yes
and all the gold bows
I think we only had one decoration broken Thomas
as well
which isn't bad „ is it
to say the tree as been up a long time
I think most of these Christmas tree decorations came from Grandma
you're painting the television as well „ are you
I think Purdie's enjoying watching the Christmas decorations being taken down
Purdie as always looked like the baubles on the tree

Purdie

I was just going to see if she'd liked to look at this bauble
look
oh Purdie likes chasing tassels
and playing with little balls like this „ don't you darling

perhaps Purdie's feeling very tired as well
I think she is
you're painting Mummy
well just be careful with it sweetheart
oh Thomas can you see this chain
it's a chain of gold stars
this is very funny because when we went to York we saw somebody's house decorated with these
and I said to Daddy oh they're unusual
I've not seen them before
and lo and behold we had some on our Christmas tree and I didn't know

aren't they pretty
what does that remind you of

would you like to put it on Thomas
there you are
you don't need your hat
it's your party hat „ isn't it
no
look
at these china plates
we better put these away as well „ hadn't we
you're painting a fire engine now
look
this plate has
can you see all those berries and Christmas roses and holly leafs
it's a picture of two little girls sitting on a cart collecting branches
and this one's another plate with holly berries
and it's a little boy and a little girl sitting on a swing
can you see all the snow around them
who's that
it looks like Thomas and Isabel to me
well the little girl's wearing a red velvet coat that looks like FatherChristmas
and she as got a fur hat
and you know how you wear mittens and gloves
can you see this little girl as put her hands inside a fur
where's the shiny stars
I don't know what happened to them
shiny stars
oh look Thomas
do you remember Grandma and Grandad buying you that
it's a gingerbread character
it's FatherChristmas „ isn't it
do you think we better take the NativityScene down as well
shall we put all these characters to bed
I think the box for this is still in the loft so I'll hafta wrap them up

and pack them in a box
can you remember who all these people are

and she's wearing a hat called a halo
be careful not to drop her
and look
we've got three kings „ haven't we
we three kings of Orient are
Orient are

look
there's gold frankincense and myrrh
gold frankincense and myrrh
you're having a lot of fun with those little stars „ aren't you
shh
they're going to sleep
yes
we're lying them all down „ aren't we
and then tomorrow or perhaps on Friday when Mummy as got a bit more time we'll wrap them all up in special tissue paper
and we'll put them back in the box until next year
all lying down „ aren't they
night night
oh look
Mary's lying next to Jesus „ isn't she
like we do
hm

Thomas please don't be cruel to Purdie
come on sweetheart
you go outside
gingerbread
would you like some
you saw it in Sainsburys
it's from Sainsburys
it says it's a Sainburys gingerbread pack
I think we can leave the candle there „ can't we
because the candle says
nineteen ninety nine Millennium two thousand
I don't know how we get into this
so I think we can leave the candle because that's not really too Christmassy „ is it
and then we've got the two reindeer and Santa's sleigh upstairs

Purdie's eating some food

she's just having a little bite to eat
oh I feel cold now
I was hot earlier on so I took my dressing gown off
