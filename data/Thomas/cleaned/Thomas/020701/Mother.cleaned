strawberries and raspberries
okay
I'll get the basket and I'll see if there's anything like that at the greengrocer
oh I can't see anything
I'll have a look on the shelves
I don't think we're going to get any Thomas
the strawberries and raspberries are fruit that are grown in Summer „ aren't they
and it's Winter now
oh

no raspberries but one strawberry
is that what you wanted
thank you
right

he hasn't got any more Thomas
he as sold out
there it is
what else would you like

there you are
just let me go back and pay him
there we are
we'll give him two pounds for those „ shall we
thank you
thank you kindly
oh thank you counter
yes
that was the fishmonger „ wasn't it

you'd like some hot chips
I don't think the chip shop's open at this time Thomas
it doesn't open until eleven o'clock
alright
I'll go and see if MacDonalds is open
it probably is
Thomas I came back from MacDonalds and I'm sorry
I've broke the box that the chips were in
look

we'll pop it there until later
we'll do that later on
so we've got fish
sorry about the chips
we've got a strawberry

well we have a green sofa but the greengrocer is the man who sells all the fruit and vegetables
do you remember that story about Pippin the monkey and Tom
they went shopping with Mummy „ didn't they
yes
buying carrots
I don't think they were buying carrots
but Tom took his little toy monkey along and he said to the man on the cheese counter

but the monkey didn't get the cheese „ did he
what happened to the cheese
a piece
a piece fell over
the cheese counter man
whatever he's called
I don't know
the cheese monger
the cheese man cut a piece of cheese and gave it to Tom and Tom ate it instead of giving it to Biffo „ didn't he
and then he went to the greengrocer and asked for a nice juicy plum for Biffo but he ate it
and a little piece of bread
he asked for some bread „ didn't he

oh it's run away in the trees with Purdie
I would imagine it would frighten Purdie if car suddenly comes through
oh dear

help you
right
we will do as soon
there are some pennys
smaller coins than these
they probably would go through the slot but Mummy as put those on a safe place because I thought they were a little bit too small for you
the only problem is I don't know what we've done with them
I can't remember the safe place
they won't go will they
what shape is this Thomas
is it a circle
is it round like a wheel
oh has Dimitra gone away
ah

round and round
sitting where Dimitra's sat
you're something else „ aren't you
this is funny
look
all the things that normally go inside the basket
are going onto the

no
I think that's a little too round „ isn't it
the eggs are slightly pointed
look
so they're standing better
some more
there should be three more eggs
what happened to all the fruit when you tipped up the basket this morning
no
we don't need the light on
where do you think they've gone

we needn't
oh look Thomas
they're all under that chair
can you see all the eggs
and there's a small lemon
can you find it

oh dear
I think some things like the grapes are too large to go on top „ aren't they
what about the banana
I still think we've got another egg under there Thomas
I can't reach it
oh no
it's not an egg
it's the lemon
a lemon
we're still one egg short „ aren't we
put them on my head
I don't know what as happened Thomas
it doesn't matter we've plenty of things here „ haven't we
it looks quite pretty „ doesn't it
are you posting
do you think the milkman brings eggs as well as milk when he comes
oh
well done
oh Thomas
now are you going to pick all those up
oh Mummy's not picking everything up
I wasn't the one to throw them on the floor
oh PostmanPat
I thought he could help because he's really good at posting things
PostmanPat with his black white cat
is that what you just said
there you are
yes
but he's very clever „ isn't he
thank you
just a second
it is the telephone
yes

there we are
we didn't talk to whoever that lady was „ did we
that's perhaps a bit rude but we've got deliverys to make „ haven't we
we haven't time to be chatting on the telephone when
we've money to get in the bank „ have we
you see you didn't want PostmanPat to help but actually he as been very useful „ hasn't he
hello Thomas
hello Thomas
right
he's ready to take some more money now
you dropped one
you're apologizing to PostmanPat because you dropped a coin
oh dear
oh he's getting some round the end „ isn't he
round the edge
he's not managing to post everything „ is he
