it's not a paper

so he's probably not bothered about that
yes
there's a letter for Mummy
oh and that's a letter for Mummy
that's a bill as well

Mummy's just going upstairs

Mummy'll go and turn it off
I'll turn it off
that's right

Mummy has a sore toe
more postman

I don't think the postman will be here now Thomas
yes
he went to Linda's house

oh that's a nice jumper „ isn't it
gosh
forty two pounds
I don't think so Thomas
I love you very much
but I'm not spending forty two pounds

forty two pounds is a lot of pennys
oh can you see that
on the front cover of the catalogue
that's a bird called a peacock
look at that beautiful blue tummy and head
and these are it's feathers
if we go to York to see Grandma
my Mummy and Daddy

one of the girls is holding a toy elephant
she must take it to bed with her
oh look at that boy

the flames were blue to start with
and then they went orange „ didn't they
no

which I might close at last
but when

yes
that little girl as got her mouth open „ hasn't she
oh what as that boy got
a wow wow

and at your age Thomas
you're going to grow out of them very quickly
that boy's carrying a boat
that is the most gorgeous jumper „ isn't it
isn't that lovely
Sonia and Isabelle
and Daddy Rod
Sonia and Isabelle's car
oh I can't see their car
what's that Thomas
a windmill
no
it's the colors of the windmills
that's called an umbrella
because that little boy looks like he's standing on the beach
at the seaside
he as got Wellingtons on
a coat
a hat
and he's holding an umbrella because it's raining
soil
that's right
he's
well yes he might be standing in soil

well this little girl's skirt looks like a zebra
look black and white stripes

would you like to sit in your chair
you can still play with those
ohgosh Thomas

bricks all down
bricks all down
well sometimes you knock them all down „ don't you
but that's one of those toys that you useta play with an awful lot
when you useta sit in your chair
and then we've not had it for a while
and Mummy found it the other day
and brought it back out again
and it's like everything else
when you've not seen it for a while you're very excited by it „ aren't you

they're both purpley colors
okay
and what about Cornflakes
would you like Cornflakes with milk
you enjoyed those yesterday „ didn't you

play in the sand pit with Grandma and Granddad
oh darling
you're sneezing
four plates down there
well when those beakers useta be near your highchair we very often used them „ didn't we
to put things like grapes in
and Cornflakes
when you were a baby they were just the right size for some things
you can still have grapes in them
or small pieces of fruit
cherries
we've not had cherries for a long time
I don't think they're really in season now Thomas
we might be able to get a few
not like there were a few weeks ago
we'll hafta have a look in the supermarket „ won't we
a supermarket

what colors

it has two flowers
a red one and a blue one
and the sun's shining

the red bib clashes beautifully with the orange pyjamas Thomas
right

Cornflakes
I'll do you another drink
would you like orange again
orange juice or blackcurrant
you can't have lemonade for breakfast
would you like orange juice or blackcurrant juice

there might be two men
on Friday we're getting a new cooker „ aren't we
and this
this one's brown
but we're getting a new white one „ aren't we
and you won't be allowed to touch it Thomas
why not
it's hot
that's right
it'll be much hotter than this one
you've never been allowed to touch this one
because it might burn
it'll be so hot
you can look at it when it comes
but you can't touch it
open the lid
what lid
a ginger pussy cat
oh yes
there's a ginger cat
oh that poor pussy cat
actually it looks a bit better cared for now but
yes
Ginger and Purdie fight „ don't they
in fact that cat fights with all the other cats
I feel sorry for that poor pussy cat Thomas
yes
it did
you see it fights all the other cats
and it's licking it's back now
it as probably got a sore on it's back
because it's not very well cared for
I think we oughta befriend that cat
and take it in
but the owners wouldn't be very pleased „ would they
the sun's shining again now
I can't work out what it's going to do
it's not raining now
but I would imagine it will
I've got some washing to put out
I'll ask Grandma if the sun shines
if she'll peg it out later
what was that
pop
toast is ready
I'll have mine now
and you can have yours in a little while
oh were you talking about pop
when the door popped
when the postman came
there was a big bang „ wasn't there
I'll put some more toast in when you're ready
it's orange
orange curd
pardon
dirty
pardon
nice white what
a sore what
Jo's Sooty
oh
Jo's Sooty
you're talking
you're talking about Sooty
Jo's dog
why should me bringing a jar of orange curd out of the fridge remind you of Jo's dog Sooty
out of the fridge
lemonade
shall I bring that bowl a little bit closer
because you're dropping all the Cornflakes „ aren't you
you'd like some more milk

spreading it on the toast
with the knife
yes
that was the noise of me cutting the toast with a knife
pardon
watch Pippin
well you can watch Pippin later
mhm
you usually watch Pippin when Mummy goes up to the bathroom
but I've actually had my bath
and I'm dressed this morning
I'm all ready „ aren't I
are you enjoying those Cornflakes
have you got a tooth that hurts Thomas
or a sore mouth
a sore mouth
I thought you had
because you keep eating on one side
and putting your finger in your mouth
what hurts
your gum
a tooth
sore mouth
oh
Mummy sore
oh I've got to see the doctor
I've just got a tiny scratch on my arm
that was through working in the garden
look
can you see it
tiny scratch
I don't think Doctor Harrison would wanna be bothered with a tiny scratch on Mummy's arm „ do you
I think we'll probably get better on our own without going to the doctor
I can see the sun shining now
quite brightly
mhm
in the garden
what do you think you'll be doing with Nana and Granddad and Daddy today
soil
soil
a machine
what machine Thomas
oh I see
are you talking about the episode of Pippin
you're talking about a machine and soil
where the potato harvester which is a big machine
comes and lifts the potatoes out of the ground
is that what you're talking about
there you are
have a bite off Mummy's toast
and see if you like that orange curd
mm
do you like it
is it juicy
mm
shall I put some more in the toaster
and then you can have a slice all on your own
pardon
oh you're talking about green crisps Pippin
you're obviously going back to this episode about lifting potatoes out of the soil
because AuntieMabel and Pippin then go to the factory
where they watch the potatoes being turned into crisps
and
and AuntieMabel says that her favorite crisps are cheese and onion
and they're in a green packet
yes please
and a red truck
I think the
the potatoes are delivered to the factory
in a big red lorry „ aren't they
with big wheels on it
is that the noise it makes
there we are
some more toast going in the machine
so where do you think you're going today
do you think you'll be going to Stockport
brushes
oh is that another episode of AuntieMabel and Pippin
where they're looking at brushes
do you think you'll be going to JohnLewis today
watch Pippin on
you're obsessed with watching Pippin „ aren't you
Mummy eat it
you not wanna eat it
you going to finish those Cornflakes
you've not had a lot to eat Thomas
you've only had a few Cornflakes
well I think when this toast's ready Thomas I'll put some Marmite on yours
yes
when it as popped
we'll put Marmite on yours
and then
you could have some fruit
in your tummy
pardon
oh I see
you can hear a noise
it's actually an aeroplane in the sky
but did you think it sounded like the noise when we pull the plug out of the bath
you just said plug off
you're talking about when we were upstairs
oh
did you hear the pop then
Thomas do it
more pop
yes
I've just popped them down for a second longer
because they weren't quite toasted
when we're upstairs in the bath we pull the plug out
and you always say plug off
and the water trickles down
and when you're downstairs you can hear it
so you must have thought that noise was the plug coming out of the bath
but it wasn't
it was a helicopter you think
mhm
I think it probably was
the ambulance do it
what
the ambulance make a noise
did you
Thomas did you just say it was a helicopter I think
did you think it was a helicopter
oh you thought it was an ambulance
a police car
you think it was a police car

but they're just coming here today „ aren't they
oh this toast is sounding very hard „ isn't it
