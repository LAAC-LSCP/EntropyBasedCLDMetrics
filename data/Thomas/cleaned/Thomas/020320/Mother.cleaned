I would imagine that's what it will sound like
Felix
baby mixer
that's right
it was a small orange cement mixer „ wasn't it

that's right
when we walked past the building site there was a small yellow mixer
it wasn't on the back of the lorry
it was standing on the floor

and it was going round and round „ wasn't it
BobTheBuilder uses a mixer
Christopher told you yesterday that he likes watching BobTheBuilder
you've not watched Bob for a long time „ have you

I've just had an idea as well
instead of walking all the way back into Didsbury
today we could go to the chemist on Queensway „ couldn't we
because we've got to pass that „ haven't we
to go to the park
so that will save us a lot of time
