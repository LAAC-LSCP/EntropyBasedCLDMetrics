RibenaToothkind
but it's strawberry not blackcurrant as normal
we usually buy the blackcurrant or the orange
what do you mean what as happened
nothing
it's just the way the packet's made darling
the bit of strawberry as gone
oh it's the pattern on the box
it's the way they've hadta fold the container over
so a bit of cardboard as gone over the picture of the strawberry
that's why a bit of the strawberry's missing

what are you saying about Daddy's car
the big wheels
flappy
it's a bit like a scarecrow actually „ isn't it
you could put these outside
although apart from they'd get wet
and they'd flap in the wind and scare the birds
very much like the scarecrow
I'm a flippy floppy man
with my flippy floppy hat
I shake my arms like that
and shake my legs like that
it seems funny it being Friday and there's no music lesson
and there's no Beehive
whose house
Linda's house
two snakes
yes
Mummy's doing another one
did you have a nice time at Linda's
no
oh it's a piece of gold paper
but it's not a paper chain
it's part of the packaging
what did we do at Linda's
have a little drink
and there was some chocolates „ wasn't there
they were nice „ weren't they
chocolates
oh yes
I think we had eaten them all „ hadn't we
and there were some crisps
and Linda had cooked some sausages for you „ hadn't she
and then Daddy hadta leave early
because he ad promised to take Nina shopping „ hadn't he
we stayed together „ didn't we
till the end
and then came back and had a lovely big bath
that's right
with Mummy
we got in together „ didn't we
was it nice
oh Abigail too

Abigail wasn't there
you have had a bath with Abigail in the past „ haven't you
Uncle
yes
UncleStuart came to see us this morning „ didn't he
you went helloq
did you wish him a happy Christmas
oh Thomas
oh no
don't say that
you're building a big bean bag
it looks rather like a bonfire
the way we've piled all these chains up on one another „ doesn't it
well UncleStuart bought a little gift „ didn't he
from Abigail
which we'll hafta open tomorrow
and we gave Stuart a gift to take back to Abigail
do you remember what it was
we wrapped them a long time ago
it was little slippers
do you remember those little blue slippers with the hedgehogs on the front
do you remember going to the shop to buy those
the shop in Didsbury
because you said it was a television shop
because when Mummy went upstairs in the shop you stayed downstairs with the shop assistant
and you could watch Mummy on the television in the shop
can you remember that
well that was the day that we bought Abigail's slippers
and the same day we bought this nice little fleecy top that you're wearing today
BobTheBuilder man

Abigail
and what's inside the present
a big tower
big ribbons
you've got a story book „ haven't you
of a little girl getting ready for a party
and she puts blue ribbons in her hair „ doesn't she
do you remember
when she's getting ready to go out
her Mummy says let's put a blue ribbon in your hair as well
I don't think that's the Christmas party she's going to though
it's a little boy's
her friend John „ isn't it
a little boy called John
it's his birthday
because she bought him some
according to the story she bought him some coloring pencils „ didn't she
and she wanted to try them out
and her Mummy said noq we've bought them for John
and then the little girl isn't very happy
are you saying again
you want it again
the little girl wasn't very happy was she
because she gave John the present and he didn't really even look at it „ did he
he just threw it on the floor and carried on with his party games
and then they all had tea
and the storybook I think said after tea they had games such as running and jumping and bouncing about
and balloons
that's right
and when her Daddy came to pick her up at the end of the party John's Mummy made him give her a balloon to take home
and he didn't want her to take the balloon home „ did he
so she ad been annoyed with him for not taking an interest in her present
and he was annoyed with her for wanting to take a balloon home
and did they have a nice birthday cake
you went to party „ didn't you
earlier in the week
no cake
there was
it was a barbie doll cake
Molly's party
yellow stripes
