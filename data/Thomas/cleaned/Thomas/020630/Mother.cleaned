Thomas was asleep by about eight o'clock

you enjoy bathtime
you've enjoyed
oh you've finished the blue crisps
you want the brown crisps
oops
watch your juice
who did you have a bath with this morning
no
you had a bath with Abigail a few weeks ago when she came with UncleVal and AuntieStuart
but this morning when you got out of bed who did you get in the bath with
Daddy
had a lot of fun
did you have a lot of fun
is that what Daddy said to you
you were having a lot of fun
well you said that earlier on that you were having a lot of fun
why were you having a lot of fun
were there lotsof bubbles
it was nice deep water „ wasn't it
nice and warm
was it hot
was it very hot
are you looking at my beaker
it says I love Mummy
and what else is on the beaker
a lot of numbers
well they're letters
they're letters of the alphabet
not numbers
I can count how many letters there are
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
actually it's twelve because it's I love my Mummy
not I love Mummy
it as got a picture of a ginger cat
and a picture of a lady
what's she wearing
what as her dress got on it
yellow and white flowers
that's right
and it says best Mummy fun kind and pretty
I don't think you'd say that about me
not today after I dragged you away from Isabelle to keep
pardon
I'm not a lot of fun
do you think Mummy's a lot of fun
oh
do you think Dimitra's a lot of fun
do you think Daddy's a lot of fun
having a bath with Daddy
is that a lot of fun
yes
oh
I must ask Daddy what you got up too
well after Mummy ad had a cup of tea at Sonia's and picked up the books we were ready to come home
and you didn't wanna come home „ did you
what did you wanna do
stay and play with Isabelle
so you weren't very happy with Mummy „ were you
you cross with Mummy
is Mummy not nice
oh poor Mummy
you'd like some cheese
what do you say
yes please
I probably offered you cheese before and can't remember
what did I say to Thomas would you like some cheese
and did you say yesq
and then I forgot
will you have this cheese darling
there you are
it's some cheese that Mummy grated yesterday for sandwiches
but there's some cubes of cheese as well in the pot
mhm
what are you saying
it's your spoon
you're using your spoon from your coleslaw to eat the grated cheese
there you are
that's quite a good idea putting it on a spoon
mhm
just thinking while I remember Thomas
I must write something on the calendar
because Mummy was really disappointed that when we were in Spain we missed having your photograph taken at the toddler group
do you remember the nice photograph that's on the mantelpiece of you
last year
and they took them again when we were in Spain
but anyway the lady's going to a school on the thirteenth of November which is next Saturday
and she as agreed to do our photograph then
now I think it was eleven thirty
because originally she booked us for ten o'clock
and then said that was too early and changed it
and I think we said eleven thirty
so I'll write it on the calendar
eleven thirty photograph
SaintWinifred's
that'll be nice „ won't it
you crunching crisps
do you not want some cheese
do you not like it when it's grated
it's just the same Thomas

I don't know what you're referring to
I'm very sorry
I haven't a clue

is she laughing
or are you laughing
what's in the mobile shop
it's not a mobile shop
it's a little bit of ginger bread left from the other day
and we've put it in a box
I think Daddy bought you that the other day „ didn't he
his legs have fallen off „ haven't they
oh poor gingerbread man
his legs have fallen off
has he got one eye missing
another eye missing
two eyes missing
two eyes gone

he as slipped again
what were you dancing to this morning
did you do same dancing at the playgroup

and the GrandOldDukeofYork
and you did the scarecrow song „ didn't you
enough dancing now
is he not going to dance anymore
what as gone
his teeth have gone too
oh did he have teeth
most gingerbread man don't have teeth
they might have a nose and two eyes and a mouth
but can't usually see their teeth
was it his mouth
you've no shoes
no socks
oh get your foot off the table Thomas
you don't put your feet on the table when you're eating
it's not very nice „ is it
that gingerbread man tastes very nice
he really tastes of ginger „ doesn't he
well I think if his legs have gone and his arms and most of his head he might very well need an ambulance
pardon
he as broken his arms
oh dear
poor gingerbread man
has he got a name
George the gingerbread man
how about that
would you like to call him George
no George
a steam roller
a baby steam roller
I must admit he looks flat enough to have been run over by a steam roller „ doesn't he
mhm
is that something that as happened on BobTheBuilder
a steam roller as run over a man
and he's very flat like the gingerbread man
he's always slipping „ isn't he
that gingerbread man
ouch
the gingerbread man bumped into Sam's mobile shop
with two wheels
oh Sam's mobile shop is from ThomasTheTankEngine „ isn't it
yes
it's the little blue mobile shop
it's a blue van that drives around Greendale and Sam has very dark hair and a hat and a moustache „ doesn't he
and Sam owns the mobile shop
pardon
are you saying knocking at the door
no
you mustn't kick the table Thomas
you mustn't kick the table
if I take your shoes off and you kick the table it'll really hurt your toes and that'll stop you doing it
the table's made from wood

you never hit wood
and you never hit glass
what's made from glass
the doors on this cupboard are made from glass

Mummy's glass are made from glass
no
you're not made from glass
what about the patio door
is that glass
and when you're drinking from glass
occasionally you have a sip from a glass
we always hafta say don't bite the glass „ don't we
because it could hurt you
that's what worries me when you play at Isabelle's house
because you like jumping off the bottom step
there's a glass front door right at the bottom of the stairs
and if you fall you could really badly hurt yourself
you wanna play with your trains now
mind the ginger man
oh there's only a mouthful of the gingerbread man left

the chair's pushed up against the window sill
but we can just see her with the top of the chair
a little bit of Purdie's back

where it's nice and warm and cosy and quiet

that's all four Teletubbies
but they're only very small „ aren't they
you've got a TinkyWinky there

and they all live in a big Dipsy's hat „ don't they
and what were they doing last night

and we were saying goodnight to them as they landed in the hat

Thomas

I think you're ready for a sleep „ aren't you

and where are you hiding
where as Thomas gone
shall we have a look at this new book Thomas
yes please
there's your digger
oh look
it's raining outside
oh dear
not nice „ is it
you'd like the big
well it's sposta be a boulder
a big stone
and it does look like an apple
and I notice it ends up in your fruit basket many times „ doesn't it
I don't know where to start looking Thomas
have you had it today
you've had it today
well I can't see it now I'm afraid
and the other thing we seem to have lost Thomas
is the driver from the digger
oh here we are
here's the boulder that belongs in the dumper truck
that looks like it's a red apple
so we'll hafta have a good look round „ won't we
thank you
a big apple for me
are you feeling alright now
you were a bit fed up „ weren't you
at the end of lunch
hm
were you a bit fed up
oh dear
oh is it smashed
right
let's have a look at this book
oh
what can you see
can you see a train
a crane
and what's this
a blue tractor
I'm not quite sure what that's called
it's a bulldozer I think
oh this is a nice book „ isn't it
ah
well it looks like the lorry with the builders in is going to a farm
Merryweather farm it's called
and look
what's that
a baa lamb
yes
but do you know what's next to it
you've perhaps not seen them pictures of this
but you sang a song about it this morning at playgroup
that's a scarecrow
do you remember
up jumps the scarecrow
and this is what he said
what a wobbly man
with a shaky head
I've got flippy floppy arms
and a flippy floppy leg
look he's made with
it looks like a broom handle and some old sacks and straw
and he as got an old jacket on with patches
and a felt hat and a carrot for his nose
can you see the carrot that makes his nose
I don't think we had enough snow last year to make a snowman
but if ever you make a snowman you'll probably use a carrot for his nose
oh
now what have we got
he's calling us his little yellow truck
looks like he's delivering crates of fruit
in FarmerStubble's tractor
there's no driver
no
because the gentleman there who drives the tractor is talking to the little girl
big fed up
what's on the next page
oh can you see all the fruit in the crate
that's a toolbox
look
it as got hammers and chisels
and all sorts in it
and can you see this gentleman here
what as the man got in there
it's tools „ isn't it
now look
if you look at the front of the truck what as happened
do you remember your story about Bertiethebus
when it hit a nail in the road
what happened
a flat tyre
now what as happened to the yellow truck
they've got a flat tyre at the front
look
so this chap's going to fix it with his spanner
oh
the little bit that I'm reading now says the truck wouldn't go
oh no
we're stuck in a ditch said Doug
and we've got a flat tyre said Dig
he picked up a spanner I'll fix it
but they didn't have a spare tyre
oh dear
there's another here
and what's this truck
BobTheBuilder
it looks like BobTheBuilder
yes
well one of these men must be called Dig and the other must be called Doug
I think that's Dig and that's Doug
he as got a wheelbarrow
that's like on BobTheBuilder „ isn't it
yes
it's a crane
well it's actually
it's called a tow truck
do you remember in your toy box you've got a little breakdown set
do you know the one I mean
shall I go and get it for you
and then I can show you what we mean
look
this is like this
only in the book it's a purple breakdown lorry
and here it's a yellow one
but look
they've got the same
can you see this on it
and this little lady's stuck in her car
look
and the breakdown lorry will tow her away
look
like that
oh now
there's another thing on the next page
this is called a forklift truck
it looks to me as if for some reason these men are carrying crates of fruit from the farm to the shop
but the truck must have broken down
or something must have happened
but without reading the book I don't know Thomas
but anyway the truck as broken down now
the truck's being towed away and it says Doug arrived with the forklift truck
so they're obviously stacking all the crates of fruits into the forklift truck to lift it high in the air
can you see the rake and the spade
he must have a lot of things in that tool box „ mustn't he

oh dear
what as happened
all the fruit as fallen over on the floor
well this looks as if they've hadta send for something else
it now says Doug arrived with a bulldozer
scrape went the bulldozer blade as it pushed the fruit into a big pile
oh
oh dear
what sort of fruit can you see there
strawberries
what are those
lemons
what other fruit
what as happened
well without reading the book properly I don't know Thomas
but they've had a bit of an upset „ haven't they
look
there's apples and pears and oranges
lemons
oh can't see any bananas
then after that they've got a digger
is there a digger come to scrape it up
and now they've got
they've got another lorry as well now
look on the last page it says Dig Doug and Daisy arrived at the shop
MissesGreen was surprised to see them delivering her fruit in the giant dumper truck
they must have used every type of truck to transport that fruit from the farmer's farm to MissesGreen's shop „ mustn't they
a big yellow van
oh
a
now this is your dumper truck
your dumper truck has a boulder in it that looks like an apple
and this dumper truck really does have apples in it
doesn't it
oh I love you Thomas
all done now
that's a nice book „ isn't it
well later on this afternoon when we sit down to have your drink of milk should we
that's the blue tractor
should we read this book again
would you like to do that
and this is the book that came with the video
so this is lovely „ isn't it
well you'll hafta watch it later
yes
oh I do think that's a nice book
oh can you see what these people are all wearing
these are called either dungarees or overalls
but look
you're all in trouser and you've got a shirt on top
but when you were smaller and even in the summer you useta have some trousers that went up here
do you remember
with the bib and braces
like that
read it again
well I'll have a little look at it
Dig and Doug had a job to do
FarmerStubble had asked them to come to MerryweatherFarm as quickly as they could
Daisy went too
a big digger
Daisy went too
you can't reach it
oh dear she said FarmerStubble must be in trouble
whatever the job said Dig we'll get it down said Doug
oh it does sound like BobTheBuilder to me Thomas
don't you think
yes
oh I see
you've got your digger digging the tree in the book „ have you
look there's a cow on the farm
so Dig and Doug sounds like Scoop Muck and Dizzy and Rolly too from BobTheBuilder

oh dear
what as happened
I don't know
what has happened
one shoe missing
a piece fallen over
oh it's from the tree

autumn time
when the leaves are falling off the trees
