I was puzzled cause I thought what child would be out in the rain

was that what she was saying

right
now do you know what to do
now I think you put some PlayDoh in there

at the Early learning Centre
look we're going to break a bit off
we can't put it away
there's too much
squidge that bit
ooh the smell is just like PlayDoh
I love that smell
ooh this is exciting cause the last time I played with soft stuff I didn't make at all right
I used your normal PlayDoh
that's right
now watch your clothes
and Purdie watch this volcano erupt
whee
yeah don't get cat hair on it otherwise it'll be the end of that
it says extrude soft stuff to make the volcano erupt
now then I'm sure we
with what comes out we could actually make something else „ couldn't we
hm
is it
oh I know
it was just you saying floppy
I know what I meant to tell you
you know Daddy and I went to have a look at that children's work that was on display
there was one with a picture of a dog in a basket
and somebody and written underneath it Floppyq
they'd called the dog Floppy in their painting
it's funny „ isn't it
oh Purdie's enjoying this
seems to like don't do oh no
cats needta like sitting on things we spread this sheet out
pardon

yes
it's a ground sheet „ isn't it
I thought it was ideal
it needs a wash actually
I needta put it on the on the floor
put it in a washing machine I think
last time we used it was outside and underneath here it's all grass
and dirt
do you like the smell Thomas
this is just how I remember playing with it
the last time we had soft stuff it smelt well awful really
hm
right
is it hard work
just watch your clothes please
put it on there please
just watch your clothes darling
can you do it on your mat not your clothes

that's right
with PlayDoh you can get all the little bits together Thomas
right
ooh squeeze like that
that's good
sorry
oh yes

now watch your face
you know those grass heads that you can grow
do you know what I mean
those
watch
you're sitting in it darling
right
just gather it up into a ball
like a ball but it's got knees as well
you know those things like stockings that you fill with grass seed
ooh Thomas
and and you water them
and hair comes out of their head
you know MrGrass head
ah she's come to say hello to you
that's nice
whoa
look at that Purds
no
don't sit on my knee now
does it look like hair
if we put a blue in that who would it look like
who do you know with blue hair
no
I don't
the Tweenies haven't got blue hair „ have they
look it's like Milo
is one of them's blue „ isn't he
a bluey purpley color
yes
is it
you could do a good sausage factory with this Thomas
it could „ couldn't it
and there's lotsof other
oh sorry
I'm screwing it up
there's lotsof other things you can make look
cause of all these cutters and rollers and
oh look
there's two little ones
you could do with your fingers
is that what they're for
let's have a look at the box
oh yes
one makes dinosaur's spines and the other makes the dinosaur breathe
fire
right
shall I use the rest of this blue PlayDoh
right
you watch this dinosaur that I'm making
ah look at this
do you want it
Purdie
yes
I suppose really you should do it like on the box
this orange dinosaur that I'm playing with ha orange PlayDoh
on the box that looks more exciting „ doesn't it
can you see it
now shall we make this one breathe fire
I think this must have been pretty new in the shop you know this
it's that I've not seen it before „ have you
I think they were just packing them when we bought it
yeah
look
rahh
do you like that
there
yes
everything could be sausage
is it
hm
just lately we laugh at Purdie just sitting with us on the mat
isn't she
just sitting quietly on your little mat
see this is it
she likes it Thomas
if we're quiet and gentle with her she might like to join in
what
oh yes
do you know what exams are Thomas
have you not hadta do anything like that at nursery school
well exams are
when you start to learn things
teachers give you tests to test that you understand and they're called exams
and I remember working with a lady who had a very elderly cat like Purdie and
that looks good „ isn't it
I like the colors
well this lady said that their old cat spent hours and hours with their daughter while she was working studying for these exams
just useta sit there like Purdie's doing now
cause they just like company „ don't they
look at that
perhaps you could do a long one there
it's quite hard actually to push it through the holes though „ isn't it
look at this
do you think he gets bigger as he gets older
oldener
older
oldener
yes
right
you just called me Nana then
did you know
is that cause you were thinking about old things
not that Nana's really old
yes
yes
makes good fun this Thomas
generally can tell
hafta have a good scrub when we've finished „ won't we
are you
I don't know whose car that is
I don't think it's Brum the yellow car „ do you
yes brumming
do you think that's why it's called Brum
brum
or did you say brum cause you think of Brum when you think of a car setting off
are you having good fun with this
this is easier to do than out of the volcano bit really „ isn't it
oh dear
it's very squashy

it reminds me a bit of a salt and pepper pot this
you know the little holes in the top
salt and pepper pots are usually quite small „ aren't they
hm
do you know what I've noticed with you Thomas
when you're concentrating on something like this
have you got blue left
you're very quiet
you don't say a lot „ do you
is it cause you're concentrating
oh look at that
he's got some little bits on his dinosaur back
and I'd be left with this
this looks like a thimble
do you know what a thimble is
a thimble is something that's
cor yes
you put on your finger
oh is it
you
Purdie
bless you
you put a thimble on your finger when you're doing a lot of sewing or a lot of needlework so the needle doesn't hurt you
and Mummy has what's called a rubber thimble at home
oh not at home at work
for when I'm counting money quick
I use a rubber thimble
on my finger
are you
well it looks to me as if it could be a nice iced cake
that's a beautiful cake

stop muttering
I'm not muttering

okay
watch my legs
right
shall we just stick with the blue PlayDoh for now
to get
look
let's just finish this cake „ shall we
that's right
slice it up with a cutter
fine

I'm still decorating this one here
I'll have a bit of that blue PlayDoh from there
it's so beautiful and smooth and „ isn't it
it does smell nice „ doesn't it
I adore the smell
hm
I think at MrsPlattford's nursery fair she was selling blocks of PlayDoh
wrapped in cling film
it was red and it felt really sugary
yes
oh that's a good one Thomas
and it just didn't smell right to me

yes

that is absolutely wonderful
that looks like a big trifle „ doesn't it
there you are
have you seen those nice things that sort of
yes
I don't know whether you remember when we went out for a meal last year
we were possibly on our way back from holiday
and somebody had a dessert that came with all sparklers on top
do you remember
sparklers are like fireworks
you were very young
I think you were very tired and out and you were dreaming
but that reminds me of that
they had this wonderful sort of ice cream dessert with chocolates and sweeties on top
and the waiter brought it and it had sparklers on the top and everyone was singing happy birthday to you
squashed tomatoes with what
oh Tom that's not nice
is it
right
so which one am I going to now this
the roller
or a cutter
there's a roller and a cutter
that's the cutter
and that's a roller
and this is a modeling tool
should we open the blue one
and then we've each got some blue to work with
okay
a sticking out of the
I'm quite sure there's loads
that's right
well I suppose you eat that in bakeries „ don't you
I'll see if we've got some cling film
you know some food film to wrap these up
oh
pardon
you're in trouble now
yeah
no
let's find the key
pardon
if I'm happy with it
go on
give me this Thomas
I'm struggling
hm you're right
no
on the chair thank you
in
are you all right with
I wonder if Daddy's seen that we're all sitting through here
he's probably
did you know we've got
there you are
okay
just keep it on that one
right
could I use pink for girls

is it a boy pizza
well it doesn't hafta be blue for boys
I wear a lot of blue
I like blue
do you think you really get
ugh
just used my teeth to open that and I wish I hadn't
taste soap in the packet
oh right
do you really think you get boy and girl pizzas
you pretend your next
right
I just opened this pink one and it feels wetter than the blue
oh look
it's got blue mixed in with it already
perhaps that's off my hands when I think about it
do you think it might be
oh that's good Thomas
that's like the „ isn't it
what was the other one
there was a stout one
oh is this the railway stop
look at this
rolling it out
oh look
well that would do good decorating „ wouldn't it
look at that
shall we try it on this pink piece of PlayDoh
right there
gently roll it once
no just once Thomas
it's cause you can't see the pattern
like this

time to walk
look at the print it's left
and this one look

yes
you can make all sorts with that one „ can't you
oh yes
look Tom
gently
makes that pattern
that's exciting
do you
a flatter
what do you mean
I could do with a little rolling pin
try and keep it all on the mat now
oh yes
I think your hands make please Tom keep it on the mat
and move a bit further away from the edge okay
will you just move that one please
near Purdie's fur please
please have a piece of blue
whose pot is too big
oh excuse me
Purdie and I are sitting here very nicely
but just watch all this
you hafta pick it all up as you're going along Tom
oh excuse me
no
I need all this now
I'm making a pink dinosaur look
like this
okay
that's one of its legs I think
oh actually on the pictures some of these things are just plain pink
and look
when I'm making it it's not just plain pink „ is it
blue pink
well it's pink and white at the moment
look on the box
the tail is just pink but the one I've got here is pink and white
would you hang on we've
oh it does
yes
absolutely
I know when we went to see Abigail and Sarah at Christmas they had all BobtheBuilder PlayDoh
do you remember
all the bits you could make Bob characters with
and I'd never seen that before and it had been in their shop a long time
and I think different shops even though it's the same store it's all the Early learning centre I think they stock different things because when we went to Wales she couldn't bring anything we've never seen here before
anyway I've seen soft stuff and PlayDoh but I haven't seen these things that you could make characters with
now look at this
Purdie don't you be frightened of this
look at that
what's this
she said hm what is it
what ever is it
do you like that Thomas
well I thought that was very nice

is it
does it
no
it's all right darling
don't get scissors
no
don't get
did you would you just come and sit on the mat Tom
come here
just a tiny little bit
what do you think to make with the green one
right
try not to get it too mixed up „ will you
the blue
well because when you wanna make say a green dinosaur it'll be all mottled „ won't it
hm this green coming out of the packet's nowhere near as squishy as the pink one Thomas
no
that's your green
smell
hm
no
no
I was just saying it's not as squishy as the pink
when I opened the pink packet felt really funny
the green one to me looks a little bit like
a Dipsy
Dipsy from the teletubbies
it looked like a pussy cat
look
don't you think
bit of a strange pussy cat I admit but
and it's the same on the packet
it's plain green yet what Mummy's working with is green and white
oh it's Purdie
it was
Thomas does this look a bit like a turtle
a rhinoceros
do you think
oh it's only its its head
looks like what
a little spine on it
oh do you mean on its nose
it almost looks like it's got a white helmet on its nose like a fireman's helmet
there we are
chocolate
is it
for all the chocolate models look
all right
it's just made with a piece of PlayDoh
oh dear
Purdie's dribbling now
pardon

this is the PlayDoh cakes „ isn't it
I think Purdie's looking pussy because I'm sitting by the glass door
and she can see my reflection
I think she thinks it's somebody else through there
she probably thinks I'm an alien
she's ignoring me because I'm sitting next to her
who's that there
on the floor
ooh
you like that one „ don't you
is that your favorite
oh yes
a bit of blue's coming off it
gosh this is superb
it's just different colored packets of PlayDoh
we've got orange
yes
pink or blue
and it comes with plastic things
rollers and cutters and stampers
and it comes with a little plastic pot so you can make your own dinosaur
oh right
at Christmas
they had well they had these and they had lotsof BobtheBuilder ones
you must have had them a long time actually
cause they
well they didn't have them for Christmas
they had them a long time before Christmas because I remember saying oh is this a Christmas present and they said oh no
this one's a strange one Thomas
we may hafta make the PlayDoh a little bit flatter
more egg shaped „ do you think
for this
are you a bit tired now
you look a bit pale
or is it that you're just concentrating
I'm not useta you being so quiet „ am I
oh no
don't Tom
no
don't love please
oh that's a nice cake
look at that Purdie
bright green cake
ah
now I think where I've gone wrong with with that dinosaur
yes
he's where's the yellow
I think he's orange not yellow
he's sort of standing up this one look
isn't he
he's got huge back legs
which he stand
they look like elephant's feet to me you know
elephant's feet
and you can't see from the picture but do you think that was for his tail
a wop
it looks like a carrot

ah
oh yeah
she's looking at her pussy cat now
it's
bet she's probably worked out now it's the door
oh don't make fun of her
this one
oh
he's not doing that on the
he's not doing that on the picture „ is he
hm Purdie I've got this wrong
oh
oh that's better
that's how it is in the picture
isn't it
yeah

or as it little dog peanut
oh I see

I don't think I've seen you grin quite like that
you must be ill
it's blue I love you
he's got big white teeth
do you think he brushes his teeth regularly
look at that Tom

like that
do you know what I've got from way back
a long time ago when we first started playing with PlayDoh you made me
we well I know we've got red and orange and green
blue plate but it always looks pink now so it must have faded
the red one
you made me a little heart with a heart shaped cutter
and it's now ever so hard
it's not soft squishy PlayDoh like this
and I've got it in my writing bureau
so when I open it ah there's a heart from my Thomas

the little things that we were pressing the PlayDoh into
well they were perfectly clean cause once they PlayDoh was out they were lovely
and then I wrapped the PlayDoh up in film and then I moved that ground sheet and it was absolutely covered in grease
so I've ended up hoovering the conservatory

did you enjoy playing with it though
it was good „ wasn't it
oh
well I've scrubbed my nails and I'm washing my feet now because I think I was treading in PlayDoh like you were
well you
are you still Jim the baker
right
hello Jim
hello
do you just make buns
not often
I was going to say at your other shop you made beautiful cakes „ didn't you
and all sorts of fancy shaped breads
you usually make liquorice „ do you
wouldn't have thought a bun maker would make liquorice but that's nice Thomas
liquorice faces
yes
oh yes
how much what
jelly
how much
churl what's churl
perfume you can eat
churl
oh
I can't even is this a made up name Thomas
gel
oh gel
yes
gel
gel is something certainly that it's like jelly actually but it's usually fairly clear
they do what they call glaze thinners with gel Thomas
gel
I'll tell you where I use it
and I hardly ever use it
but
yes
the gel
yeah
oh right
do you know how I make gel
with fruit juice and a little bit of corn flour
if I'm making something like a strawberry tart that I wanna put a nice glaze on
a nice sheen

I make a pastry base and then I'll fill it with something perhaps confectioner's custard or something like that
and then get beautiful fresh strawberries wash them slice them in half and arrange them all on the top
and then I usually have some sort of fruit juice
might be strawberry juice or orange juice or cranberry something like that
mix it with a little bit of corn flour or Arrowroot I think I usually use which is a very fine flour
boil it up or
I can't remember it's so long since I've done it but you heat it anyway
Tom what is this doing here
is that why everything's wet
that's naughty
you must not throw
well I'm sorry
it's got up there somehow „ hasn't it
and then when you boil it up it becomes and you pour it over the top and then you've got a clear glaze and it's called gel
that must be what you're thinking of I think „ do you
right
did that oh
I was just about to say did you wet your face now
dear you
right
so I'm just going to get a cloth and clean all this up
was it
why are you throwing water
it's gone all over the
later
no
not really ate it
ooh
radio
won't work
well it well actually this is a special radio that's sposta be used near a shower
but I don't think it means pour water directly onto it „ do you
right
are we still putting it up into your bath
right
so where have they all gone
for those dirty toys
right
pop it back there
sit down
sit back
you didn't
oh dear
well Daddy put you in the bath and when I came up the stairs you were saying I wanna get out of the bath
and it is late „ isn't it
that's why Daddy shouted you
been in it long enough for „ haven't you
you like it at their house
good
sit back please
well you could have done but you said you didn't wanna
no
but you told me too late Thomas
didn't you
don't
don't get
don't get upset
now don't get upset
come on
it's all right
it's absolutely fine
we can go back another time
come on
don't be so upset
you're upset now cause it's late and you're tired
are you not
oh
do you not remember when I spoke to you on the phone I said do you wanna stay and you said after lunch home
and I said are you sure and you said after lunch home
so you know once you'd told Nana and Grandad that they got ready to bring you back
no
you can't do that
sit down now
they'd made preparations then Thomas
well it doesn't matter cause there are other times
what people
no you don't
don't ever say that Tom
you don't hate them
no no no no
right
we stayed past when they said do you wanna stay you said noq you wanted to come home after lunch
and that's what happened
you came home after lunch
well
do you mean your jacket that David gave you
I'm sure some of them would be
I'm going to give it a wash though first
yes
oh no I don't think you'd be allowed to do it in the playground
too much
in their class
no
cause it's not a school uniform „ is it
oh
no
right
I might just give your face a quick rubbydubbydubdub
well we can have it on sometimes
I'm sure
yes
if you like
do you think Jeannine would like to see it
yeah

is it a truck driver's
hm
do you think they'd be very thrilled to see that
a
oh no
but you know if you take it you must be prepared to share
what I mean is
if you take it
and somebody says can I try it on then you must be prepared to say yes
oh no
you can't do that
if you take it in you hafta accept that some children will wanna try it on and if they do it's cruel to say no
when you took a pencil machine in
oh that
yes
well yeah but people did borrow that „ didn't they
they played with it
but they played nicely „ didn't they
well that's what I
green group
who's in the green group
Luke
so you mean really Luke
I'm just going to take my contact lenses out
who's yellow group two Thomas
you
you're in yellow group two „ are you
no you no oh I don't think you should take it in if you're going in with that attitude
that's not nice

well I would imagine ladies and mens are the same really cause it's only like a waistcoat
it's a fluorescent jacket „ isn't it
hm
well it's the same color and shape as the one from your police outfit but that one says police on it „ doesn't it
right
I've just taken my contact lenses out
and I'm just using this special wipe on my face
look
well that's to get my make up off
that's the whole idea
I don't wanna go to bed with make up on
well because your face isn't clean
you know I mean you've just had a nice bath „ haven't you
we go to bed nice and clean
and if I don't take all my make up off I'm not clean
and I could be spotty tomorrow
I'm spotty today
that was probably why I wear make up to cover up all the spots
and it makes them
well it makes them disappear but it probably doesn't make them any better
well I don't
oh no
you wouldn't really get rid of me „ would you
just cause I've got a
ah poor Mummy
that's not nice „ is it
oh
what would you say

no
it's not broken
right
going to film
right
