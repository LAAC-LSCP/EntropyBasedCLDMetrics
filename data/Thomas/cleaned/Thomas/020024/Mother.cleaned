pardon
Purdie
I don't know
she's here
hello Purdie
do you wanna go out
I'll open the door
perhaps she wants to go out
no she as gone back upstairs
but what as happened to your shoes and socks
have you taken them off
those are some cotton reels
and that's a basket in the shape of a cat
put the basket on the stairs because it has some sharp needles in it
