I don't actually know what they say but I remember being in the park once with a friend and we heard a noise
it was sort of November time and it was all the squirrels chasing each other
up and down the tree
and I can't remember what the sound was like but when I went to the park another time and I heard this noise I immediately thought ah that's the squirrels because I recognized it
knock knock knock tapping on the tapping on the shelves

woodpeckers sound like that
that's right
a woodpecker
Thomas please will you put your legs round
sit properly
now look at your clothes
just look

and it holds onto a tree and it goes wood wood wood peck peck peck
wood wood wood peck peck peck peck
most peculiar indeed
it's funny because I've only heard you sing that song once
but the minute you started to say wouldn't it be funny I thought I bet Thomas starts singing that song
and you did
whoops a daisy
the red light's come on here so we needta change the battery
I think

now what do you say
well done
you're a good boy „ aren't you
yes
very clever
there you are
there's a nice spoon for you
wait till you've eaten that before you open this in case you don't want it Thomas

I think I might have that piece of bread that you've not eaten
I thought I won't make more than one sandwich because I won't eat it but actually I seem to be a little bit hungry
that's right
that's what I mean
I needn't have two pieces of bread
I'll just have the piece of bread you didn't eat
did you
well you've had quite a lot because you've had the sausages and the bread
and one piece of apple
and a nice yoghurt
is it nice
tasty
do you remember we bought that in Tesco on Thursday
oh when was that Thomas
Thursday
why was I annoyed with you on Thursday
you were trying to go to get some sweets
what
you better not have done
in the shop
in the shop
I would be more than annoyed
would have been absolutely furious if I'd known
in Tesco
you ate a sweet in Tesco
that's stealing Thomas
no but nothing that's stealing
no I don't think he would Thomas
went out of my sight long enough for a security guard to ask you a question like that
seriously Thomas if you take things without paying for them that is stealing
doesn't matter whether it's one sweet one grape whatever it is if you take something from a shop without paying that is stealing
listen I'm serious if the security man had seen you you could be in prison now
what sort of sweet did you take
did anybody see you take it
is that when you ran round the corner
and is that when I shouted come here
is that what you were doing
you did it very quickly „ didn't you
now listen I didn't see you do that
I know you went round the corner and I shouted and you came back
don't ever do that
I mean it Thomas
do not do that
in future you hold my hand or your hold Daddy's hand or Nana and Grandad's hand
no you hold our hand anyway
I must see where you are
because listen if you ran round that corner and you took a sweet without me seeing somebody could have taken you without me seeing
couldn't they
but please don't do things like that Thomas
I know
I know it's very tempting when all the sweets are there and you're feeling hungry because it was quite late „ wasn't it
because I picked you up from school and then we went to AlphabetZoo
no it wasn't AlphabetZoo it was WackyWarehouse
and then we went to Tesco so I know it was near teatime
but you know if you'd been so hungry you should have said to me I'm very hungry
and even then I couldn't have let you eat something before we paid it but at least I would have known that you wanted something
don't
well you moaned on that you were hungry but you didn't say please can I have something now
please Thomas don't take things from shops
you're lucky this time that the security man didn't see you
but there are cameras watching
there is Thomas
I absolutely promise you there are cameras in shops watching
I am not joking now
I know I joke with you and I know I tease you about the police getting you and things but seriously Thomas there are security men in shops for that
Thomas why do you think security men are there
they're there in case there's any trouble and in case anybody takes something without paying for it
to keep you safe
to keep other shoppers safe from people who are stealing sweets and not paying for them
that's why things are so expensive in the shops darling
because if people keep taking things without paying for them the shop hasta make a
well I was going to say a profit but you won't understand that but
the shop hasta cover its cost
well that means
they sell things at a price
and if everybody goes into the shop and pays that price for things everything's fine
if a few people don't pay
then the shop
oh
well I'm going to tell you this anyway
you hafta listen now
the shop hasta take enough pennies in its till because the shop people hafta pay the people who deliver their sweets
say you have a factory and you make sweets
right
right you hafta find money to buy all the ingredients to make the sweets and to pay all the people who make the sweets
then the delivery men need paying as well
and so when the shop decides I wanna sell some sweets it's got to say to the factory how much are your sweets
and the factory will say such and such
well say twenty pounds
so the shopman pays twenty pounds
now the shopman must make sure that he has enough customers to give him enough money so that he gets his twenty pounds back
and if everybody pays there's no problem
but if a few people don't pay then he hasta put the price up really high for those that do pay
now how many times have we been out and you said oh I want that and I say I'm sorry I've got no money
because things are expensive in shops Thomas
but listen just before you go more to the point
you mustn't do it because you would
if the security man or a policeman had seen you in fact if a security man had seen you he might have asked the police to come
now you imagine spending a night without Mummy in a police station
all because you'd taken one sweet
it doesn't matter whether it's one sweet five sweets a toy whatever it is you never ever take anything from a shop
alright
I'm sorry to go on
please don't wander off
you've got crumbs all over
no
well sit back and I'll get you another yoghurt
which color would you like
right now you just take on board
you take on board please what I've just said
because I know it's boring
but it's serious Thomas
and you
MisterRighteous who's sposta be so clever and so good
and I find out you've been pinching sweets
oh by gum
mhm
there you are
orange
just one orange
whoops quick
no you're not having any more after that
no
because it's quite enough
quite enough for one day
they're only very tiny actually „ aren't they „ those

well could you eat that one first please before you get another one
legs down
come on
if you're still eating you're at the table properly
thank you
well four cost me ninety nine pence
and ninety nine pence is a penny less than a pound
you know one of those coins
those thick coins
the round ones
small
that say one pound
if you gave a shopkeeper one of those
that's if you pay for it Thomas
if you gave the shopkeeper one of those coins and handed them the fromagefraissfra they would give you one penny
that's the brown coins the smallest brown coin
they'd give you one of those back
one penny change
because ninety nine pence
ninety nine pence in a penny is a pound
no
yeah I don't think the people in the shop would like toy money
well because it's not real money „ is it
mhm
yeah but this is the thing Thomas
I know sometimes you think I'm mean when I say Mummy hasn't got any money but Mummy hasta go out to work Daddy hasta go out to work
when you work
if you've done a good day's work your boss says well done here's some pennies
and then I hafta make those pennies last to pay for the house the electricity the water treats toys sweets
all sorts of things
and when the money runs out that's it
I hafta go and do some more work
there's a saying money doesn't grow on trees
and it doesn't
you have to work for money
and only the people with money can buy things
well I wish it could grow on trees
but it doesn't
you hafta work hard for money
and you can only buy things when you have enough money
which is why many times we see things and I think oh I'd like that or I'd like to buy that for Thomas but I can't because if there aren't enough pennies in my pocket I can't do it
and if you
well Purdie knows this because I've spoken to Purdie about it before
and if you haven't got enough pennies in your purse or your pocket or your wallet to buy things then you can't have them because taking things without paying
well that's it you see
so you couldn't have it „ could you
now if you'd taken ten p and it was nine p you could have it and get a penny change
that's fine
you give them three pounds and they give you a pound change
or you'd be better just giving them two pounds and keeping a pound to yourself
but no this is it Thomas
you can only buy what you can afford and if you can't afford it you hafta leave it on the shelf because people who take things when they can't afford to pay it end up in prison
okay
people like you
it doesn't matter who you are
if you take things without paying for it that's where you end up
no in a police cell
and the policeman would be very very cross with you
they wouldn't be like they are now
when you see the policeman they say hello son how are you
they'd say naughty boy in the cell
and they'd klonk the door
and that would be it and you wouldn't see me
yes
think on
end of lecture
oh Thomas
yes alright
but Mummy always does pay Thomas because it's just not worth the risk „ is it
okay

are you alright
meow
right shall I tell you a little story now Thomas
when I was a little girl
I went shopping in York with NanaBealby and we went to a shop called Woolworths
and you know Woolworths in Stockport
the toy shop
remember the toys
I went in there and we were walking along and on the floor I saw a tiny bit of metal
it was only a little thing
a tiny thing
and I picked it up and thought oh I like the look of that
and I had a dolls house and in my dolls house I had all sorts of things like bedroom furniture wardrobes and beds and dressing table and things like that
and this little piece of silver that stood like that
it was almost like you know the letter a
a triangle
it was almost like that but it was all made of metal
ever so tiny
and it was so bright
I could see my face in it and I though oh that would make a superb mirror for one of the dressing tables in my dolls house
so I picked it up
and I was about to put it in my pocket and GrandmaBeably saw me and she went absolutely mad
and do you know what it was
in those days
you know how now you have little stickers on everything
a man goes round with his sticker gun and all the prices are put on the goods
well in those days
it happens a lot now as well
they useta have these little sort of price tags are the only way I can describe them above the goods
say I was selling that
above it would be a little piece of metal and the shopkeeper would put the price on the metal
and these little metal things useta slide along the bar and they would show all the shoppers the prices
and I didn't realize but what I'd picked up was one of these little metal bars
so I thought oh it's just a bit bit of something on the floor nobody wants it
I'll take that home for my doll's house but NanaBealby made me put it back because it did belong to somebody
it belonged to the shop
and she made me understand
I don't know what she's said to me but I've never forgotten it
she made me understand from a very early age that you don't take things
because even if you think it's nothing if it's in a shop it belongs to the shop
oh if somebody gives you it in the shop
I mean occasionally we go to shops
well when we went to MrsSweets shop do you remember she said oh have that and she gave you the odd sweet
that's totally different
usually because you've been a good boy
they don't give naughty boys
you know rowdy boys sweets
but you never take anything
even if
what is it
yeah
I think what we'll do next time we go shopping
you know the little toy purse that we brought from Spain
well it's not a toy purse it's a real purse that we brought from Spain but you use it with your play shop
when we next go shopping we'll put some proper money in there
and when we go to a shop and buy something you can pay
and then you can see how much change you get
because at the moment you always come to the till with me and we always say please and thank you
always pay for things sweetheart
yeah
you can if you get any change
right
I love you
I don't want you in prison
what shall we play
how about policemen catching naughty boys
where's the naughty boy
Purdie
no
oh right well let's get our hands washed and finish lunch

why
oh well
don't yet because we wanna go out and post the letter now
no let's post our letter and then perhaps
well we can play it when we go to the post box
you could put your police helmet on to go to the post box if you like
no
I could be the naughty boy and you could hold my hand as if you're arresting me
okay
oh I'm not going to the post box with handcuffs on Thomas
that's taking it too far
you'd probably end up posting me
stop smacking my bum
you messpot
not really
