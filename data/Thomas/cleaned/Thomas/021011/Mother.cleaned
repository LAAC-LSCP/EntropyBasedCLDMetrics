and all sorts of different compartments
look
and this is called the jewelery roll
when we go on holiday Mummy can put rings and earrings and some necklaces in there

that one goes in the middle there
that's it
lower down
a little bit lower down
that's it
that one goes at the bottom

and that tray goes at the top
I thought it was black but I think it's actually navy blue
it's very dark navy blue „ isn't it
I'm not quite sure what this is Thomas
look

a knicknack
it's like a little secret tray „ isn't it

look
I'm plugging the iron into that
let's hope it works

the light as lit up
oh that's good „ isn't it
I don't normally bother ironing your socks
no
I don't usually bother ironing your socks but they've got so crumpled up
they've been drying on the radiator and they've been screwed up
I'll just give them a quick press with that
you've got lotsof socks „ haven't you

oh you can't

I can't let you strike the match
there
how's that
this is a match
that's the candle
it smells like what
a what worm
a cheeky worm
well it's sposta have a nice smell Thomas
I don't think the smell as had a chance to get out yet
but it smells nice
smells like dirty
oh I don't think it does
oh the iron sounds a bit like a snake „ doesn't it
what's it saying
what's the iron saying

psh
it's a steam iron
like the steam train
it's a steam iron

it sounds like a steam train
anything with steam makes a noise „ doesn't it

oh I see
you're pretending the Smarties are letters in the back of the train „ are you
it's a mail train
and where's it going to Thomas
Mummy's house

oh thank you darling
very kind of you
thank you
well it was the hospital
it was the hospital ringing Mummy
I've just got to go for a check up
people do now and again
yes
a check up
you know like we go to the Doctor's
and Doctor's just check us over to see we're alright
well Mummy hasta go to the hospital in March
and that was the lady just phoning up to see if we could go
or if I could go
I'm sure you'll be with me
yes
well Daddy might come as well
I don't know
it's at one o'clock on Thursdaytheninth of March
Daddy might very well
it might be Daddy's lunchtime then
Daddy might call to look after you so that you don't hafta come to the hospital
they're quite exciting places to look at but sometimes
oh that's a different hospital
yes
yes
you're thinking about the one in York „ aren't you
where there's a huge post box at the entrance to the hospital
but this is WithingtonHospital just down the road
and they can be exciting places to watch but if you're waiting a long time which sometimes you are I think you'll get terribly bored
do you remember when we went to Wythenshaw last
WythenshawHospital
in the waiting room there was that beautiful big red bus
and Mummy and Daddy had tried all over the place to buy a big red bus and we couldn't find one
and we went to the Outpatients in WythenshawHospital and they had a beautiful big red bus
and you played with it all the time
you probably don't remember that
I sing it
I can't sing it darling
what do you want me to sing
the little red bus
I only know one song about a bus and that's the Wheels on the Bus
is that the one you mean
a big red bus
I don't think I know a song about a big red bus
well how does it go
Thomas you sillybilly
that's the Wheels on the Bus go round and round but you've substituted the word red
no wonder I didn't know that song
you've just made it up
alright
we'll sing that one then
red

that's the little book you have called a little yellow bus and that plays a little tune and at the end it goes „ doesn't it
well it is ValentinesDay Thomas
so I suppose we can sing about red
I'm not sure where the book is sweetheart
well let's just sing it again
can you not remember
well the driver is called Pete and he has a little yellow bus
and one day
pardon
well I think he just calls it his little yellow bus but we could give it a name if you like
what would you like to call it
AuntyFrank
oh Thomas you've called your fish AuntyFrank
you can't call a bus AuntyFrank as well
can we
no
well we'll think of a name for the little yellow bus
and the driver and the bus is stuck in the traffic „ aren't they
one day
and the driver's fed up with this
and he said
it's time we had a day off little yellow bus
it's time we took a day in the country
so the following morning the driver gets up and he washes and he polishes his little bus „ doesn't he
and they set off for a day in the country
and I think it's just sposta be the driver and the bus
but all the way along he meets people who want lifts „ doesn't he
like there's some people riding bicycles who were stuck in the rain
and there's an elderly lady
and there's a lady with some children and they're all tired of walking and two boys
one of them has a flat tyre on his bicycle and all sorts of things happen
and one by one the little yellow bus picks them up „ doesn't he
and then who do they meet at the side of the road who as broken down
that's right
yes
one of the things
yes
a pilot lands in a field „ doesn't he
and helicopter
and he says
may I have a lift home
but
no
that isn't part of the story
he doesn't say
Thomas Lastname you do make up storys
no
what happened
who breaks down at the side of the road
the ice cream man
and the ice cream man says to the bus
my ice cream van as broken down
all the ice cream's going to melt
so he gives it to all the passengers on the bus „ doesn't he
so there they are
they've all had a nice day out
they've all had a lift
and they've all had an ice cream
and the driver says to his little yellow bus
oh it's been a great day out
it's been just like a normal day picking up all these passengers
and who else is in the story book
do you remember there's an old lady
and what's she
what was she riding in before she saw the bus
in the what
in the dotdot
you're just making things up now
well she was riding in the basket of a hot air balloon „ wasn't she
oh Thomas you're going to knock the horse off
ah poor horse
that's not nice „ is it
oh the train as turned into a police car „ has it
that's interesting
has it
it as got flashing lights
why is the horse crying
and has the police car come to the horse because the horse is crying or is the horse crying because he as seen a policeman
oh what as he done then
naughty horse
has he been a naughty horse
oh dear
how can a horse be naughty
what as he done
he as frightened somebody's what
frightened somebody's beer
what do you mean
pardon darling
the policeman said naughty Mummy
why
what am I sposta have done
I've bashed the train
what train love
train
oh the tray
Purdie's tray
well I walked into Purdie's tray earlier on and her water bowl fell over „ didn't it
I hardly think we need call the police over that though Thomas
did he
the policeman said what's going on
ah
and what did Mummy say
well it's a funny thing Thomas
because when I walked into the tray and knocked Purdie's water bowl over I remember the water going on the floor
and I remember picking up a cloth and wiping it up
I don't remember any policeman coming and telling me I was a naughty girl
you didn't even bother to come through to see what had happened
you just shouted what as happened
did you look
did you peep
did you see me moping up the water
no
you didn't you see because you didn't bother coming through „ did you
no
you just asked me what had happened
you're a monkey Thomas
look
we're getting all this ironing done
this is good „ isn't it
oh no
I said all the Smarties had gone
no more
that's why I asked you twice
have you
oh so you have
that's why I was asking you if you were sure you wanted to give them away to me
did I

I can't remember
what would you like darling
okay
alright
I heard
how's that
you don't like the little boy
well let's leave him
let's put him over there by your juice
he is the driver of the car though
pardon
what did he say
oh the little boy's crying because he wants to go in the trailer and you said no
oh no
it's not Thomas
no
what have we said about sharing

some things may belong to you but when other people come it's nice to share „ isn't it
you go to Becky's house and you go to Isabel's house and Bethany's house and Jake's house
just imagine when you got there all the time they said you can't touch my toys Thomas
they're mine
you can't go in there Thomas
it's mine
you can't have a Smartie
it's mine
you'd be terribly upset „ wouldn't you
precisely
because you'd want one
you'd wanna join in
you'd like to play with the toys and see what's happening
and look
fair enough all those people have at times got a little bit upset and said things are theirs
but in the end it as all been sorted out and you've both played with things together and done things together
it's the same when people come here
at first you might enjoy showing off your toys and then you get a little bit fed up because other people are playing with them
but that's all part of playing together and sharing „ isn't it
it is nice to share things
and if you let people share things here then when you go to their house they're happy to let you share their toys
yes
because you're very generous with Mummy and Daddy „ aren't you
and Nana and Grandad
you want us to share things with you
is that the racing car driver
is it
well our train driver as gone missing „ hasn't he
I don't know what as happened to him
pardon sweetheart
who's under the chair
no
the train driver as been missing a long time Thomas
the train driver
the little Duplo train driver has got little blue dungarees „ hasn't he
and his head moves round and his arms move round
but we haven't seen him for a long time
he as gone missing
I don't know what as happened to him
you had him one day and then gone next „ didn't you
it's at playgroup
no
we've not taken him out Thomas
we've taken the train many times
when we've gone to Weddings and Chirstenings we've always taken the train because it's something you've been happy to play with quietly at tables „ isn't it
we haven't got anymore trains love
but we've never taken
we haven't a crane either
but when
yes
we've got a digger
would you like a digger
what do you mean what about
oh Dizzy's upstairs
Dizzythemixer's in the bathroom and he has been for quite a few weeks now
he as got vegetables „ has he
is he a fruit and veg lorry
are you

cheeky „ isn't it
cheeky meeky
Mummy's not cheeky „ is she
pardon
so when we've taken the little Lego train to places we've always checked that we've got everything before we've gone home
this was just one of the days in the summer Thomas
when one day you had the train driver and the next day you didn't
so we don't know what as happened to him
is it
the train as turned into a fire engine now „ has he

yes
and where are they going to Thomas
they're in the FireService but where are they going to
who as got a fire
I have
oh goodness me
well the candle's lit
and I've got a hot iron in my hand but I don't think we're on fire yet „ are we
ohgosh where
where have we got a fire that Mummy doesn't know about
oh there on the edge of the table
ohgosh
well I hope
oh I hope he gets to me quickly before it spreads
hello fireman
oh I am pleased to see you
Thomas says we've got a fire on the edge of the tablecloth
can you help me please
thank you fireman
appreciate that
oh well done fireman
thank you Thomas
for pointing out the fire
that's very clever
bye bye fireman
thank you
would you like a cup of tea before you go
oh are you driving off
well would you like some tea first or do you hafta go and put out another fire somewhere
another fire
ohgosh so really the fireman's a little bit too busy to have a cup of tea with Mummy „ isn't he
oh near the flower on the tablecloth
there's another fire „ is there
I hope he doesn't notice the candle burning at the other end of the table Thomas
otherwise he will be upset because it's a big flame „ isn't it
look at that
oh here you are fireman
there's one I've just made
a nice fresh pot
would you like milk
ah but would you like tea or coffee
tea
and would you like milk in the cup first
no
you'd like some sugar
how many spoonfuls would you like
one
there we are
there's the tea
there's the sugar
look
we'll leave a little jug of milk at the side just in case he changes his mind and he wants to pop some milk in it
he as had tea coffee
a tea and a coffee
oh that's good
he as put the fire out „ has he
I hope this iron isn't making a nuisance with the noise
it as gone a bit noisy now „ hasn't it
can you hear it
can you
is the noise annoying you Thomas
you've put your hands over your ears
does that mean it is
I've got a fire there „ have I
did you get wet then
Mummy pressed the spray button on the iron „ didn't she
did you get wet
I'm terribly sorry
it does take more help to put the fire out Thomas
the more water there is
is it
the fire's better
good
all the engines are parked up
are they all at the fire station
help fireman
I've got a fire on the tablecloth
please come quickly
oh I haven't got time to talk to Grandma and Grandad
there's a fire to put out
quick
help
you've finished your talking
you've finished your talking to Grandma and Grandad so you're going to come and rescue me now „ are you
help
oh I'm just cooking some chips for Thomas's tea and oh the chip pan as caught on fire
it's AuntyMabel
do you think the firemen will help me Thomas
on that flower this time
oh I see
you're pretending that the flower is a chip pan „ are you
oh right
well let's get a tea towel
where as it gone
there you are
that's right
that's what you do with chip pan fires „ isn't it
oh no
you dampen the tea towel
you run the tea towel under the tap till it's damp
and you squeeze out the water and then you throw the cloth onto the chip pan
you must stand well back but you throw it on
but you never pour water onto hot fat especially a chip pan
the fireman probably used a fire blanket „ didn't he
we have a fire blanket somewhere
I think it's
oh Thomas
oh dear dear
oh dear dear
I'd forgotten we had a lit candle at the end of the table

oh no
I shouldn't laugh because that was really very dangerous

no
it wasn't actually
no
I didn't laugh actually because the tea towel darling
wasn't damp
it's just dry and I didn't realize you were going to throw it on top of the candle
and the tea towel's on fire now
oh dear dear
oh
I wasn't quite expecting that
yes
goodness me
that took Mummy by surprise
no
I wasn't laughing but it was shock Thomas
it was
I was horrified
I was shocked at what you'd done
now you only ever put it on the chip pan fire Thomas
I didn't expect you to throw it onto the candle
because the candle isn't really a fire
it's a special sort of a fire „ isn't it
when the candle's lit
no
it's a candle
can you smell the nice smell
oops a daisy
oh dear
it looks like the fire engine as had an accident there
has the fire engine crashed
oh heck
oh dear
you look shocked now
have you just had a fright
oh the police car as crashed too
why have they both crashed
what as happened
don't be silly Thomas
did they slip on some mud
did they both skid on some mud on the road because they were going very quickly
oh dear dear
well who is going to rescue them if the police car
luckily the ambulance hasn't crashed „ has it
I bet you do
yes
you need something
it as been a terrible accident „ hasn't it
do you
well I'll go and see what we can find
would you like to blow the candle out now Thomas
right
now don't touch it
you leave it there
it's like a birthday cake „ isn't it
right
now sit still
you mustn't touch it
are you going to sing happy birthday to somebody
you needta blow it
okay
oh well done
now can you smell that nice smell
it smells beautiful „ doesn't it
right
I think it's time we changed you
look at the smoke now
no
you really do need play on the table but I think we could do with getting you changed
you don't need it at all
yes darling
you can carry on playing in a minute
but I think we needta get you changed
oh Thomas don't get upset
well listen darling
if we don't get you changed oh then you're going to end up very wet indeed
oh sweetheart I know
getting changed
you'll hafta go upstairs and have a big bath and then you'll be even longer without playing on the table
now would you like to talk to this little man
no
you don't like it at all
no
I'm not going to battle with you
what's upside down
what's not fair
that little boy that you wouldn't let sit on a car
he as just jumped down your vest
you don't know whether to laugh or cry
shall we put Teletubbies on
let's just put the picture on
„ won't it
while we're doing this
no
you don't need the
it's not your dress
it's your vest
no
that's your vest
you wear a little vest „ don't you
you don't wear dress Thomas
Mummy wears dress
Grandma wears dress
no
Grandad doesn't wear dress
nor does Daddy or Thomas
it's a bit confusing though really because you wear trousers and so does Mummy
but Mummy wears dress and you don't
Mummy's lucky really „ isn't she
right
are you going to just lie down
you sound like a steam train going
or a little puppy
it's a funny noise „ isn't it
what a funny noise
what a funny noise
can you see the Teletubbies
well let's be quicketyquick about this and then we can
shall I tell you what as happened
looks like a little boy's eating
oh I'm not quite sure what he's eating
a lemon
no

it might be an apple or a piece of toast
you know I can't tell what it is their eating
I think they're all eating different things actually
ah you've seen the video before so you
I bet they're not
you've just said that
you needta wake up „ do you
why are you making that silly noise
I've just got rid of the steam iron
we've finished doing some ironing so that noise has gone
now you're starting up
right
will you lie down please Thomas
the sooner we get this done the sooner you can go
no
would you like a pillow
you're propped up with a pillow
because listen
the longer you're messing about the longer it takes us to do this
if you could lie still we could have it done in two minutes „ couldn't we
you're a spot
I'm not
I'm not
AuntyMabel
well AuntyMabel's on in the mornings
no
it isn't
it's just that the Teletubbies are on a video
mind you we do have AnutyMabel on video as well
which is your favorite Teletubbie
Dipsy
and NooNoo
well NooNoo cleans up Tubbie custard and TubbieToast when the others have spilt it
do you what I think it is Thomas
you're right
they're lemons
they're lemons
I didn't believe you when you said they were lemons
it's oranges and lemons „ isn't it
I don't know
yes
he is
I think it's in Spain
well I think what they've done Thomas
they've picked
ah that's an orange
they've picked some lemons off the tree
and they've picked some oranges and they've put them in a basket
but the two little boys are now peeling an orange
it's an orange they're eating
but they certainly did gather some lemons
it looks like it's either their Grandfather because they're with a much older man „ aren't they
more like GrandadBeilbie „ is it
yes
I don't think GrandadBeilbie as ever been picking oranges and lemons in Spain but
Grandad as got a poorly tummy
oh dear
is he better
well we haven't seen him for a while „ have we
FiremanSam's up in the air
well Grandma and GrandadBeilbie do live a long way away
Grandma and Grandad Lastname live quite a long way away but they're not quite as far as Grandma and GrandadBeilbie „ are they
there we are
we've got a beautiful clean boy again
you're not a dirty boy
little white van
yes
it's just driving away „ isn't it
it as been to the house next to Sue's
what do you think it as been doing
being doing what
you can see TinkyWinky and Po
what are they doing
they're eating Tubbie custard „ are they
did you
what did you hear
big birds are coming out of my hair
and a lion
well that would be a funny noise
and I think if Mummy realized that was happening she'd be making a funny noise as well
shh trousers on quick
oh Thomas
come on
you're the slowest child to dress
will you be quick
LaLa as got a ball „ has she
LaLa as got lovely hair like me
ah that's nice
no
slippers on
slippers on quickly
no
we don't need powder now „ do we
or that
come on
slippers on
and seen as we've got the hairbrush let's just brush your hair
right
you brush it then
you brush it and make yourself look a
a smart boy
what
your head's warm
it is quite warm
it isn't too hot though „ is it
I think I'll just finish it off sweetheart
how's that
when you get very hot your hair sticks to your head „ doesn't it
you get very sweaty
okay
how's that
get down
Thomas
