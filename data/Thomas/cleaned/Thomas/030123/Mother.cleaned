what are you playing with
are you
no
it doesn't work „ does it
that
it's Daddy's old telephone „ isn't it
some sand
let me look
some sand
no
I don't think it has Thomas
it might have a little bit of dust
he has „ hasn't he
yes
Daddy as got whiskers near his chin
have you got whiskers
on your teeth
oh I don't think you have whiskers on your teeth
oh there
above your lip
yes
who else do we know that has whiskers
no
hopefully not
but who do we know that has whiskers
who lives in this house with whiskers
Purdie
are you
what did Purdie say
what do I eat
you wanna play with your snake
well let's have our breakfast Thomas
and then you can play with it
you shouldn't really have toys at the table „ should you
well you can have your snake but the telephone as got to go
I know
but when I say it as got to go I just mean when you're having a meal
no
don't keep saying hey because listen
I know it's yours and I'm not taking it away but when you're having a meal you should be concentrating on eating your food
and your hands get sticky
and then everything you touch gets sticky
and we hafta wash it
so there's the snake
the telephone's just going a minute
is it
is it on the table
going
is that what Daddy does when he's making a snake noise
I don't think a lot of people like snakes Thomas
don't they
is that what they tell you when they see it
no
you can
right Thomas
would you like a cereal bar or would you like some cereal in a bowl
cereal bar and honey nut loops in a bowl
oh sorry
there you are
BobtheBuilder bowl
who's on that
big skip
let's have a look
oh yes
what's in the skip
bricks
yes
a lot of bricks
Pilchard's sitting on top
yes
BobtheBuilder
yes
we can't

he'd soon go out of business if he couldn't do a lot of the jobs „ wouldn't he
oh look at that honey nut loop Thomas
all the others have a hole in the middle
look
that one as got something in it
there you go
how's that
you're going to pretend the dustbin bag's on the road
excuse me
why
does he
well I'm sure you can share your honey nut loops with the snake „ don't you
you've got a lot there
I don't think you'll eat them all
oh is that what the snake's saying
and what do snakes eat Thomas
ham
do they
oh
ham
I didn't know that
it's quite a noisy snake „ isn't it
are you
or the snake is
you mean the snake is having a sip of your drink
right
I see
you don't mind sharing „ do you
oops be careful
oh this is why I say no toys at the table
because you end up knocking things over
but it wasn't your fault really „ was it
it was the snake
the snake is a dustbin man
oh yes
well the dustbin man did he shout oy once
because the driver started to drive away before they had put all the bags in „ didn't he
he did „ didn't he
you mean the dustbin bags started to fall on the road not the man
that's your windmills whizzing around because it's a horrible morning „ isn't it
right
yes
it's the windmills turning round quickly because it's windy and it's raining
it's not nice „ is it
do you remember we had all that lovely sun a few weeks ago
and you were wearing shorts „ weren't you
and you hadta put suntan cream on and a hat to keep you cool and not get burnt
and now we're back to putting things on to keep you warm and dry „ aren't we
oh Thomas don't put the snake in your ear
that's silly

would you like a real snake
would you really
they're slippery slimy things „ aren't they

what's the song Julian taught us about the snake
in the slippery grass
do you remember that

I know it's in one of your rhyme books „ isn't it
but I can't remember it now
that's right
it's something like I saw a slippery snake
what was it
slithered and slithered on by or something
oh I can't remember
I'll hafta have a look in the book
can you feel how rough the snake skin is
can you feel the skin

I'm feeling it
yes
it's all rough „ isn't it
it's nice and strong like a sausage
who's being daft
oh look
he's going to eat those honey nut loops

do you remember that big snake Christopher had
that was from the EarlyLearningCentre like this one
it was a huge snake „ wasn't it
really big
who did you scare
your Daddy or Christopher's Daddy
what with the snake
did you go towards him with the snake
did he
oh dear
yes
he can hold them on his tail „ can't he
oh dear
that's a funny way to eat honey nut loops
you're threading it onto the snakes tail and then using the snake's tail as a spoon „ aren't you

I can't remember now
you had one snake and then Purdie bought you another one for your birthday
which
you've got this one and an orange one
which was the one Purdie bought you
this one
she did
that was nice of Purdie „ wasn't it
you're hugging it on it's nose now rather than it's tail „ are you
right
well Mummy as finished her cornflakes
oh look at the rain
it's not nice „ is it darling
that's right
pitterpatter
that's what it's saying
we'll hafta change your little chart round „ won't we
on the door
to the one with the umbrella

oh it's on cloudy at the moment
shall I change it to the umbrella
and then later on you can change it to something else if the weather changes
I don't think we've got a bicycle on the weather chart Thomas
yes
we've got an umbrella for today when it's raining
a cloud for when it's cloudy
a sun for when it's sunshining
and a snowman for when it's snowing
I've just found Daddy's work keys
oh dear dear
no
he didn't „ did he
silly Daddy
well I think he as been at work for about an hour now Thomas
if he'd wanted his keys I think he would have been home by now
look what I found when I went to take Daddy's keys to the door
I found the other snake
that's something
yes
because there are two snakes now to share your breakfast
oh yes
Thomas would you like some bread
some toast
would you like a slice of this
doesn't it
I think he just likes honey nut loops
I'll do some toast but I wondered if you'd like to try a piece of this
we haven't had hot cross buns for a long time „ have we
and this is a
no
we haven't got any hot cross buns but I wondered if you'd like to try that because that's quite like it
it's called a spicy bun
spicy bun loaf
oh we haven't got any hot cross buns Thomas
well when we go in to Didsbury we'll see if the Baker still has them
I doubt whether they do
Tesco might still sell them
I'm going to pop mine in the toaster
would you like yours toasted
yes
would you like some ordinary toast
okay
there's little sandwiches there from lunch yesterday
would you like those
yes
Mummy's going to have a piece of cheese with this spicy bread
would you like some
oh just the bread
do you not want it toasting
just bread
oh there you go
are you going to have some as well
are you sure you don't want some jam on it
would you like a piece of cheese
no
I'm asking if you'd like it
you'd like some cheese
which cheese would you like
what about having this one
little strip cheese
well if you have the little strip cheese now there's not going to be any for lunch Thomas
you that „ don't you
no
we haven't got lots
mm that bread smells nice when it's toasted
can you smell the fruity bread
well that's just ordinary bread
mm that smells nice as well „ doesn't it
the nicest smell is when we've got the bread maker on
it smells lovely „ doesn't it
when we get up in the morning and smell that
there you are Thomas
some cheese
blue green and red
what's blue green and red
green and blue
but what are you pointing to
oh I think he's sort of red and orange
that one „ isn't he
not really green and blue

did you
oh you smell Mummy's bread now
it's hot
be careful
doesn't that smell nice
are you sure you don't want some
you want a little piece
a big piece
oh I don't think I've got any quite as big as that Thomas
oh no
it's just some butter
you don't want the butter
okay
just let it cool a minute though
it as just come out of the toaster
there you are
Mummy'll do herself another piece
it does smell delicious „ doesn't it
you like currants and sultanas „ don't you
would you like some cheese to go with it
there's your strip cheese there
more like a block of sweeties
what sort of sweeties do you buy that looks like that
jars
I don't think we've ever bought any yellow scarecrows Thomas
there's a little sweet shop in Didsbury we like because they sell sweeties in the jar „ don't they
and loose sweeties
they still have a penny trail though it costs about three pence for us to buy something these days
when we went in yesterday the man was serving at the counter and you said where as the lady gone „ didn't you
and what did he say
he said well with any luck she's at home cleaning and shopping
and I said ah poor lady
that doesn't sound like a very nice day off „ does it
he did
he laughed „ didn't he
oh dear dear dear
I can't get the bread out of the toaster
toast on fire
not yet anyway
I think I've possibly put too thin a piece of bread in
that's the problem
uhoh
oh I don't think we need a fireman Thomas
it certainly is
are you enjoying that
I thought you would like it
we actually bought this in Michael's shop „ didn't we
he's a butcher not a baker but he sells some nice loaves of bread
they're all wrapped up
sausage and bacon
yes
he sells fruit as well „ doesn't he
yes
yes
he sells lotsof fruit „ doesn't he
I'm having problems now because
the bits of bread got stuck in the toaster I can't get them out
the toast's not on fire but we've just got a problem because
yes
I hafta unclip the toaster altogether Thomas
I don't know how I'm going to get it all out
what a nuisance
pardon
well I cut the bread very thinly
because I didn't think you were going to wanna eat an awful lot
and then you ate my piece so I put you piece in the toaster for myself but it was really too thin
right
there we are
we've still go some more
if you've ever got to do anything to the toaster like Mummy's doing now Thomas
you must unplug it from the wall
you pull the plug out
altogether
because
it's very dangerous to do what Mummy's doing now if it's still switched on
I wouldn't want anything dangerous to happen
oh that as added a bit of excitement to breakfast time „ hasn't it
bother
that's what I'm thinking
I wish I'd just taken a piece of ordinary sliced bread
right
here we go
the toast is free so we'll try again
I'll put another piece in it that's a lot thicker this time
I've probably done it too thick this time it'll get stuck again
ah dear dear
would you like some more
you would
okay
let Mummy just finish cooking this piece of bread
Mummy's bread
ah when this one's cooked we'll share it
it's very nice „ isn't it
we'll look at the list of ingredients and see what it as got in it
oh it says vine fruits
that's grapes
tangerines and pears
and citrus peel
and there's a picture there of oranges and lemons
that sounds nice „ doesn't it
do you remember that orange bread we useta buy
we've not had that for a long time „ have we
mind you
we don't really buy bread now since we make our own
who can paint a shed
I thought we were talking about bread
bread not sheds
painting breads
I thought you said painting sheds
mm
I think you're saying silly things
oh dear
this smells like it's well done
yes
little strip cheese
you like that „ don't you
no
I'm fine
thank you
I've got this nice crumbly Lancashire cheese here
no
I'm fine Thomas
thank you
there we are
we'll put this other piece in for you
now remind me we've got toast in the toaster
what's hard work
eating sweets
oh you better not eat any then
I wouldn't want you overworked
don't you
what about some grapes or some strawberries
or a banana
nothing
are you full
is your tummy very full
oh
a little cough then
ow that's very hot
I know because it was very hot when I picked it up
I think I must have been touching one of the fruits in the bread
you like currants and sultanas „ don't you
and raisin
it's toy time on the table
oh
you want your tea and tea lorry
well please just give Mummy a few minutes longer to finish her breakfast
at least I'll finish this slice of toast and then I'll clear your plate
and then you can play with some lorrys on the table while I finish the rest of my breakfast
how's that
does that sound a good idea
no
of course not
no
don't put them in a drink Thomas
pieces of cheese don't need a wash in your drink „ do they
no
what have I said
if you don't want food you leave it alone
now don't do that Thomas
listen
you've got to learn that when you've finished a meal that you push to one side what you don't wanna eat
you don't start playing with it Thomas
it's very bad manners
you don't do that
that's right
now if you've finished with it
now put the cheese you don't want onto the plate and push it to one side please
you don't start squashing it up and messing about
that's much better
these bits of cheese you don't want pop on the plate and any fruit you're not eating pop back in the bowl please
that's a good boy
oh that's a very good boy
that's very clever
pardon
put the piece of cheese back on the plate like I want you to
good boy
what about that small piece over there
you might as well it that Thomas
it's such a tiny piece
you won't
okay
pardon
are you rolling up your place mat now
is it
hello beady eye
oh yes
that was the other thing in the song about the snake „ wasn't it
he looked at you with his beady eye
was that the snake or was that the one about tiger in the jungle
he looked at me with his beady eye
yes
thank you
right
we're going to clear these plates
are you sure you've had enough
you've eaten quite a lot this morning „ haven't you
right
just hold your snakes now while I wipe the table
and then I'll wash you hands
and would you like to just stay at the table and play with some lorrys
that would be quite good „ wouldn't it
the snake's disappearing through the place mat
oh dear
Thomas there's another piece of cheese at the side of your chair down there
are you enjoying your drink
no Sir
oh don't start that again Thomas
it's not fireman choice
it's when he hears the fire bell chime
no
it isn't fireman choice because fireman choice is not a person
it's meaning when FiremanSam hears the ring of a fire bell
well I think it's probably his
I don't know whether it's his alarm
it's like an alarm clock I would imagine Thomas
it'll be something at the fire station
a little alarm that rings to say come on FiremanSam
it's time to get out of bed
you're needed
what's this cheese doing here
that's right
FiremanSam's asleep and then it says
when he hears the fire bell chime FiremanSam is right away on time
either right away on time or right on time
right on time
he gets up quickly „ doesn't he
well what happens on the television program
that's right
he slides down his
on his bannister
that's right
yes
that's right
he holds onto the bannister and he slides down it „ doesn't he
and when he gets to the bottom of the stairs what comes out of the wall
a hat
his helmet
his yellow helmet
and a cup of tea
and his shoes
isn't that wonderful
yes
all these cupboards opening
cup of teas handed to him
and a helmet and his shoes
wouldn't that be nice in the morning if you came downstairs and somebody immediately handed you a nice piping hot cup of tea
I think that would be lovely
do you
well let's
Mummy as not quite finished her
let me just wipe your hands again sweetheart
and then would you like to look at your lorry
that's what you asked for
I'll put the snakes back on the table for you because they've fallen down „ haven't they
there you are
would you like to dry yourself with a towel
I'm watching
yes
shall I take this off now
you don't need that „ do you
are you feeling warm enough darling
there's your tea and tea lorry
well there's your bus
and there's your tanker
would you like the postbox as well
you don't want the pillar box
well look
it's the same as the tea on the tea lorry
you see this clip underneath
well in a minute
yes
look
you put it in sideways
just like you do on the tea and tea lorry and then you turn it around and it'll work
do you want me to do this one for you
you put it on sideways
that goes into that hole and you turn it round
I will
right
have you got the doors ready
you slide the money
that's a two pence piece
thank you
and that's a pound coin
oh dear
can you open them
knock
has the man appeared and opened them
is that what you said
where did the man appear from because his cab's over there
can you not put the cab on there
there we are
that's not harming it „ is it
do you know what that coin is Thomas
what is it
fifty pence
that's a fifty pence
and that's a
twenty pence
the big one with the funny sides is a fifty pence
the small one with the funny sides is a twenty pence
that's right
that's the bottom of the postbox „ isn't it
oops a daisy
the cab as come off now
no
it's too big
we'll put it over here
that's right
leave it on top of the bus
oops a daisy
why does this keep falling off Thomas
it doesn't wanna work „ does it
do you know what these are
ten pence
five pence are the smaller ones
right
I'm just going to finish this breakfast that I've been trying to eat
pardon
fuming breakfast
what do you mean fuming breakfast
fuming breakfast
oh I've not heard him say that
what does he mean by fuming breakfast
oh I see
are you sure he says fuming breakfast
well we nearly had a fuming breakfast when we set fire to the toast
there were fumes all over „ weren't there
oops a daisy
botheration
oh bother
the parcel as got on the bus
can you tell me which is the fifty pence Thomas
no
only one of them's a fifty
which one is it
no
they're twentys
that's a fifty that you have in your hand now
I would put the coins in the bus Thomas
because you can't get them out
it's different with your T N T lorry
where's your post lorry
is it
what do you say
that's right
that's more polite than get it Mummy „ isn't it
please may I have
no
I'm saying that's what you should say
that's a nice way to ask for something
sorry
I can't see it in the drawer Thomas
is it in the train track drawer
I can't see it

last year you played with that all the time „ didn't you
oh what as happened

just be careful with that Thomas
because if you drop it's going to break
well I've looked in all your toy boxes Thomas
and your post lorry isn't there
oh I wonder if it's in the mail sack
no
not there „ is it
I'll just have a look in the chair
have a look in the toy box Thomas
there's an awful lot of things
you'd like your train track
well the table's not very clear for that „ is it

I've looked in every box and I can't see it

and then Mummy must do some jobs in the house

you can help if you like
right
what are you doing
are you a train delivering lotsof money
oh carriages
mm
oh doesn't the wood smell nice on this train track

I don't think we'll make such a huge train track today
no
we'll have another one coming out of this branch „ shall we
is there
do you wanna just get that side of the track
my little dumpling
who's a little dumpling
Nana useta say that when you were a baby

oh is that mine

I'm was trying to get that to come round here

it can go under the bridge „ can't it
how's that ThomasHenry
alright
I still think it could do with a little bit more track „ don't you
I can hear a train now
yes
can you hear it
are you
Thomas I'll put that there and then it won't fall off the end „ will it
we're going to have a bridge

Mummy was only teasing
right

ThomasTheTankEngine's going to sit there so nobody can get past the
how's that
those trains don't really work on this train track very well „ do they
they're more for playing on a flat surface
no
it's alright just on the floor but it doesn't really work on the tracks
these wooden trains are built especially to go on the wooden train track „ aren't they
but the little ThomasTheTankEngine is better for when you're playing at the table or just on the floor
where did we buy a ThomasTheTankEngine
do you remember
on your birthday
it is was in the PasstheParcel „ wasn't it
do you remember
you want a sweetie
it is it because you're not having sweeties Thomas

oh you haven't
you mean that's a threat
you'll wee in your nappie if you don't get a sweet
that's not nice
no
that's not a nice threat
shall we sit you on your potty
what's too late
