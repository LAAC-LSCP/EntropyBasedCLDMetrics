where is he now
he's here you think
is he at Sue's house
loading up Sue's rubbish
he's going round
bye bye
we can still see the flashing lights „ can't we
yes
the van as gone
but we can still see the reflection of the flashing lights
on the cars „ can't we
all the bin bags have gone
yes
you can still see the flashing lights in those cars „ can't you
can you still hear the noise
no what sweetheart
what do you mean not press my button
oh did you not see them press the button today
to churn up all the bags
well the trouble is it's only four o'clock
but it's very dark „ isn't it
outside
so I don't think we could really see what they were doing
we can't see the lights flashing now in the cars „ can you
Mabel come out
no
she's called Sue
she's not called Mabel
you thinking of AuntieMabel
it's Sue's neighbor
she's also called Sue
well her lights on the car flashed because she was just setting the burglar alarm „ wasn't she
not a burglar alarm a car alarm
that's it now for the bin men for another week Thomas
oh look she's driving off in her car
she must have been unsettingv the alarm ready to go
she fell down in the car
she as driven off
can you see where the bin men have left us a new bin bag
in the drain pipe
no
they've not taken that
they've brought that
they've brought that
it's a clean new bag
for Mummy to put in the dustbin now
and that's what they'll take next week
this clean bag you see now will go into our dustbin
and we'll start putting rubbish in it
and then by next Monday it'll be full
and they can take it away
won't be nice and clean like it is now „ will it
ah isn't it funny Thomas
in winter
on a day like today when it's raining
the fireman's going now „ is he
oh I see
don't worry fire engine
bye bye

on a wet day they don't half get on with the job
you want Mummy to sit down
is that Purdie crying
when it's a wet day they're really quick getting all the bags into the bin
and they're off „ aren't they
on a sunny day it takes them a lot longer
oh what's the matter with Purdie
no
don't upset her
you come through here with your toys
oh you blowing her a kiss
hello Purdie

all the rubbish out
stop it pushing you
I wasn't pushing you Thomas
I was just trying to stop you going out of the door
because it's raining
it's wet
we've just left the door open so that Purdie can go out if she wants to
you mustn't go out
you've got your slippers on
Thomas I'm
what lot of things
you're not going that way
it's too dirty
what do you mean you're not going that way it's too dirty
too muddy
you've been
you've been for a walk
you've got your wellies
oh well you've still got your slippers on
but we're going to put your wellies on in a few minutes Thomas
I think
I think it would be nice to get out for a walk
even though it's wet „ don't you
what are you saying to Purdie
like a carrot
what do you mean like a carrot
that's what Mummy puts on the radiator to dry some clothes
why's Purdie crying Thomas
she's hiding from you „ is she
are you chasing
you're throwing rubbish
are you gathering all the cushions off the chairs and throwing them like bin bags
are you showing Purdie what the bin men did a few minutes ago
is that what they did
Thomas
a lot of rubbish bags
yes
oh
have you just given Purdie a kiss
food over there for you Purd
are you showing her where her food is
are you turning her round and pointing her in the right direction
why are you telling Purdie not to go that way
it's too dirty
do you mean it's too dirty because you've got all your
all your bags of rubbish
you're being a dustbin man
I'm watching
why are you showing Purdie in there what you're doing and shaking your head
did one of the dustbin men shake their heads
well why are you shaking your head
I can't understand
why are you doing that
you've pressed the button on your PostmanPat book to play the tune
let's draw the curtains now Thomas
because it's dark and wet outside
it's not nice „ is it
a lot of rubbish bags
in a
in a moment Thomas
let's put your Wellingtons on

two cushions
they're dustbin bags

don't throw
you're pressing the button
is that for the rubbish all to be ground up
see a flashing light

do you know why she's running about
she's running away from you because you won't leave her alone
right
let's leave Purdie to eat
we'll get your Wellingtons on and we'll go out
okay
are you strapped in
right
well you sit there
and we're going to melt some chocolate now „ aren't we
right
now that's very hot water
so you mustn't touch it
it's straight from the kettle
look
can you see we're putting water in the saucepan
and then we've got a jug „ haven't we
inside of the saucepan
and we're going to melt some chocolate
yes
very hot
because tomorrow it's Purdie's birthday
and we're going to make a cake for her „ aren't we
and Mummy was going to put some chocolate pussy cats on top
so we've bought some chocolate and we're going to just break a few squares off
would you like to eat one
I thought you might
there you are
what do you say
what do you say
yes please
so I'm going to pop the chocolate into that jug
and we'll melt the chocolate
and then when it's all runny we'll pour it into some shapes
then it should come out as chocolate pussy cats to put on top of the cake
what do you think to that
I don't think we need melt too much
I'll just do two more squares
there we are
we'll save the rest
would you like to eat another piece
I thought you might
pardon
oh I see you're holding that piece I've just given while you eat the one that's in your mouth
that's okay
it looks very dull outside „ isn't it
now
look at it
no sunshine today
no
all done
you've put the other piece in as well
right
now if I bring this nearer to you you won't touch the pan „ will you
because it's very hot
but look
we've got a spoon with extra long handles
so we can stir „ can't we
here
you stir it
but you mustn't touch the pan because you'll burn yourself
there
okay
I think we'll put a little bit more hot water in that Thomas
there we are
well let's just leave it a few more minutes to melt a little bit more
it'll soon start melting when the hot water reaches the jug „ won't it
now this is what we're going to do Thomas
when the chocolate as melted we're going to pour it into some moulds
so we'll get the moulds ready
oh that's funny
there's a tray now with a pussy cat on it
what's happening
there we are
we'll put that liner on the tray
a fire on board
what do you mean there's a fire on board
fire nice and smooth
oh you're putting the sheet of parchment onto the tray
are you thinking back to the program when AuntieMabel and Pippin had a chip pan fire
and the fireman covered the chip pan with that cloth „ didn't he
is that what you're thinking off
mind the pan
no
you've got to mind the pan because it's full of boiling water „ isn't it
the chocolate's melting quite nicely now Thomas
I'll hafta leave it a little bit longer
that's a pussy cat tray „ isn't it
are you going to sneeze
well if you're going to sneeze don't sneeze near this
it's just a little mark on the paper
no
don't lick it Thomas
not when we're going to put food on it
no
are you kissing Mummy's arm
kiss the fire engine's arm
is Mummy a fire engine
who were you kissing yesterday
Isabelle
you kissed Isabelle a lot of times „ didn't you
do you wanna just have a little look in the pan
no don't touch it
because it's very hot
but just look in there
can you see
chocolate as melted
can you see
it's running off the spoon
no
that's right
Mummy do it
where as Thomas gone
you're playing with the piece of paper „ aren't you
hello Thomas
you'll be able to stir this in minute
because it's nearly all melted
and then you can see when we pour it into the moulds
the fireman's making chocolates
there
I think it as all melted Thomas
that beautiful chocolate
right
now if I take that out of the pan
would you like to have a little stir
be careful
the jug'll be hot
but the spoon's fine
that's right
you stir it
round and round
oh there's
keep the spoon down
you're using your left hand a lot „ aren't you
do you prefer to use that hand
there
right
do you wanna use the other hand
you've had enough mixing
I think that's lovely
look at that
oh
lick it
no
you can't lick it yet
we'll just have it back in the pan
Thomas be careful
now will you put that piece of paper back onto the tray please
pop it back on the tray
right
now these are very hot
what are these
you'll burn yourself
don't touch them
what are they
shapes
what shapes are they
no
they're not triangles
are they pussy cat shapes
look
that's a cat sitting down
and that's a cat standing up
now let's see what we're going to do with this chocolate
yeah
now we won't move them
we'll just leave them where they are
and we're going to spoon some of this chocolate into there
like that
oh can you see
no
it's not a horse
it's a pussy cat
does it look like a horse
you think it looks more like a horse
a jumpy jumpy jumpy horse
there
I think another spoonful should do that
we'll fill in all the shapes
no
be careful now Thomas
you mustn't knock it because it'll spoil
let's just get some chocolate there
can you see where the pussy cat's ears are
at the top of his head
oh I just wanna press the chocolate right into the corners
right
we do the same on the other pussy cat
and then we'll see how much chocolate we've got left
and we can put some more on „ can't we
and then we'll put these in the fridge to set
and then tomorrow we'll make the cake and we'll put some cream in the middle
and we can put some icing on top
and then we can stand these two chocolate pussy cat shapes on top
do you think Purdie will like that
and would you like some birthday candles on the cake
no
you'll be able to help Purdie blow them „ wouldn't you
you would
because I don't think Purdie would be very clever at blowing out birthday candles „ do you

you useta do that when you were a baby
and you were tired
instead of saying go to sleep you useta lie down and go ahphss
do you remember doing that

everybody go to sleep
because Granddad snores and Daddy snores

do you not want me to lie with you

this is a little book called Snowman's squeaky song
shall we read it
oh Purdie's here
hello chicken
yes
there's dinner for her
oh no
there isn't
no
the cake's not ready
no
we've just made the chocolate to go on top of the cake tomorrow „ haven't we
don't tell her about it
it as got to be a surprise
once upon a winter's day when snow lay down around
three elves made a magical snowman who sang with a squeaky sound
just once
that's right
when Mummy says squeaking or squeaky or squeaked or squeak you can press it then
at first the snowman's squeaky song was just a touch off key
but once he ad coughed and cleared his throat he squeaked most tunefully
the story spread around the town about the snowman's tune
they marvelled at his clever squeak
how he did it no one knew
soon the snowman could be found each day of the week
in the park where skaters danced
where he would cheerfully squeak at Christmas time
on starry nights the snowman traveled round
his squeaky voice so sweet and clear bringing joy to all he found
and who do you suppose they choose to lead the ChristmasParade
the snowman thrilled the festive crowd with his squeaky serenade
on Christmas eve the snowman squeaked a Christmas song so sweet
but all who heard it snuggled down to a cosy cheerful sleep
can you see the little boy there asleep with his teddy bear in his arms
oh there's another little boy asleep up there
even the bird's asleep in it's nest
look
on ChristmasDay our snowy friend sang just for SantaClaus
and Santa loved his squeak so much he clapped without a pause
no
one squeak when Mummy says squeak or squeaky or squeaked
they say the snowman sings his songs in snowy lands the whole year long
a tree as fallen down
yes
it's just a log „ isn't it
it's a branch
and what's sitting on it
a little mouse and
a pussy cat
no
that's a fox
and if you listen carefully you just might hear his squeaky song
did you like that
you want the FatherChristmas one
this is called Santa's squeaky boots
so it's the same sort of thing Thomas
when I say squeak or squeaky or squeaked or squeaking you can press it once
oh I've not said anything yet
Santa had some brand new boots the day of ChristmasEve
but when he walked they made a squeak that no one could believe
once please
he wore them to his workshop where the elves were making toys
each time he squeaked they all stopped work and cried what is that noise
when Santa walked out to his sleigh his boots squeaked in the snow
the reindeer started giggling to hear him squeaking so
then Santa waved goodbye at last and disappeared from sight
when Santa stepped out on the roof his boots squeaked in the night
slipping quietly down the chimney with the sack he creeped
but when his two feet touched the floor his boots made such a squeak
why are you biting your thumb
does your mouth hurt
those squeaky boots woke one small child
who wandered out to see
just what could make that squeaking sound
so Santa hid behind a tree
all through the night that squeak was heard
on floors and roofs and stairs
in fact his squeak brought out the mice
by morning Santa's squeaky boots had squeaked the whole world round
he even grew to like the squeak
and smiled to hear the sound
so if you're waiting up for him
and wanna take a peep
you're sure to hear him coming first
you'll recognize that
that Christmas
that squeak
do you see the Christmas tree there
hold the star
there's a star on top „ isn't there
Thomas is it your mouth that's hurting
or is it your thumb
not teeth
because you're biting a lot „ aren't you
oh isn't it miserable and dark
oh
what as happened
nothing as happened
I think Purdie wants some food
shall I give her some food
we can't give her cake yet Thomas
no
but listen
even when we bake the cake
FatherChristmas is coming to see Purdie
and he'll have a present
wow
that sounds exciting
very exciting
I think
do you think it's very exciting as well
but Thomas when the cake's made I don't think Purdie's going to actually wanna eat the cake
we can eat the cake
and we can put candles on it for Purdie
but I don't think pussy cats really like cake
we'll give Purdie some chicken with some salmon
we'll give her something that she likes to eat
we'll have the cake
we can sing happy birthday to her
and we can put some candles on it and blow the candles out „ can't we
what as happened
well it looks like the racing car as got both it's doors open and it's bonnet open
is the fire engine coming and the police car
are you a tired boy
what as happened
you want the fire engine to mend it
am I the fire engine
okay
shall I mend it then
I'll shut the doors
they're quite stiff actually
and put the bonnet down
there we are
it says number one
number one's mended
one door open it
another door open it
what do you mean the
oops
what do you mean the fireman do it now
it's squeaking „ isn't it
a little bit like Santa's boots
and the snowman's squeak song
can you hear the car squeaking
why are you calling Purdie a fish
a yellow fish now actually
can you see the snowman as got a hat on „ hasn't he
a little bit like the fat controller's top hat
and he's wearing a nice red and green stripy scarf „ isn't he
is he waving
no
I don't think the digger will fit in there Thomas
that's the little shed that you put the in
it's far too small for the digger
shall we try the digger in this box
it's a little bit bigger
oh it still won't go properly „ will it
it won't go in properly
let's try backwards
no
it still won't go in backwards
what funny noise
it's the car
the car's hiding there „ is it
stay there
what the car
you'd like the car to stay in there
you want the car to hide behind there
right
you can't see it now „ can you
because it's hiding
where as the bus gone Thomas
where's the bus
where has the bus gone
where as the bus gone
when you were a lot younger that's all you useta say
where's the bus
where's the bus
do you remember
you useta spend hours looking for the bus
you useta hide the bus under the stairs
and then say where's the bus
and we'd all hafta look for it
and you would always know where it was
I think the bus is in that box
it's not in that box
because that box is empty
and it's not in this box because this box is empty
I think it's in
