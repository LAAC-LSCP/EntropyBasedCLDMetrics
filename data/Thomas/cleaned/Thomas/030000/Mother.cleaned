I think it clips on there
do you think it goes there
I don't know love
let's have a little look
ohgosh it all comes apart
look
the back comes down
now you could use that as a dustbin lorry „ couldn't you
what happened today with the dustbin lorry men
we didn't see them coming properly „ did we
we only realized they were here right at the last minute
what are they Brian
oh you're pretending it's a dustbin lorry
it's a superb yellow digger „ isn't it
but the back comes down and you can use it as dustbin lorry
it as got a on the front
where's the driver gone
it came with a little driver „ didn't it
what as happened to the driver
you've got a lot of nice cards „ haven't you
lorry man where are you
I don't know where he is Brian
yes
but I don't know where the driver is
I can't see him
that's the digger man from your old digger „ isn't it
you got that digger from DaveKelly when you were one
that's for your first birthday
this one
and have you got your friends coming round later
for the party
who's coming
who's coming Brian
I don't know
we've got B and C „ haven't we
and R and J
J and Georgia
I
B
J and J we're doubtful because his Mummy doesn't think they can make it now
B
and A providing A's Mummy hasn't had a baby
because A lives near O
and her baby brother or sister was due last Saturday and they haven't arrived yet
you're too busy looking at that to talk to me „ aren't you
no
I wonder what as happened to the little man Brian
when you were showing people before
did you put it back in the toybox
who as touched it
ohgosh I've pulled the toybox out and found a crocodile on the floor
it gave me a bit of a shock
well it didn't quite bite my finger but I think it would have done if wasn't
if I hadn't been a little bit more careful I think it could easily have bitten
yes
well I hope you find the little man Brian
because if we don't
we keep losing little men „ don't we
well we lost a little man from the train set
well he as just disappeared „ hasn't he
and this little man
was exactly the same
he was wearing different clothes
a bit like the racing car driver „ wasn't he
would you like the racing car driver to be the digger man
because I know where he is
that's very strange Brian
I'm sure he'll turn up somewhere „ don't you
FiremanSam as put it away somewhere
and who's that from
J and B
what is it
it's a DizzyMixer „ isn't it
from BobtheBuilder
is he the dustbin man
oh and that's what you got in PasstheParcel yesterday „ isn't it
because when Grandma and Grandad were here we did a little PasstheParcel „ didn't we
who's that
you got some sweets
yes
inside every layer of paper there were sweets „ weren't there
and then the final parcel had this in it
who is it
ThomasTheTank
and we've wrapped another one up „ haven't we
for today
well exactly the same
there'll be a lot more layers than yesterday because yesterday it was Mummy Daddy Grandma Grandad D and S and Brian
and today we've got lots and lots and lotsof people wanting to play PasstheParcel
so Mummy'll do what she did yesterday and keep turning the music off
and each time the music stops somebody takes a layer of paper off
and they'll get some sweets „ won't they
we've got milk buttons
we've got Smarties and we've got JellyTots
they're little round jelly sweets
different colored sweets with sugar on top
and then whoever opens the very last parcel will get a little ThomasTheTankEngine like that one
you need some sweets now
you didn't eat the sweets before we were playing with so I hid them
I didn't think you'd realize
there you are
oh do you want
do you want some JellyTots
is that what you mean
right
well I don't know if I've got any left
I've wrapped them up
I don't think we've got JellyTots Brian
oh yes
we've got a few
these must have some JellyTots you won yesterday
there we are
JellyTots
there you are
be careful with those

that's a superb mixer from Jo „ isn't it
it says
not suitable for children under three years of age
yes
but that's alright „ isn't it
because you're more than three now „ aren't you
you're three
oh you're sharing with Mummy
thank you
you are three now „ aren't you

this is really good „ isn't it
it says
turn the handle to rotate the mixer
is that what you're doing now
and does it go on it's own
like that
the JellyTots are nice „ aren't they
have you noticed the orange mixer is the same color
as your lorry „ isn't it
oh and what's this

and then who gave you that one
P

wriggly snakes round our neck
has it dropped on the floor
let me have a look at this snake
ohgosh that looks like real snake skin „ doesn't it
look at that
all scaly
I wouldn't like to touch a real snake
watch the JellyTots because they're sugar
shall I put them in the little pot
no thank you
are you going to eat them
no
I was just going to wipe the sugar up so you can carry on playing with your toys
you don't wanna get everything covered in sugar „ do you
it'll make everything sticky
Mummy was trying to tie balloons on the door this morning and it was so windy „ wasn't it

it's in here
let's open the tools

right
oh it squeaks as you bang it down
just be
just be careful with the table
do you remember what happened with the other hammer you had
you broke it „ didn't you
yes
yes
don't be rough with this one
it says there's an adjustable wrench but I can't see
let's just check on the back of the box
adjustable wrench
that's not in the box „ is it
or has it fallen out
no
that wasn't in the box „ was it
oh Brian there's actually something missing from the box love „ isn't there
you've got the builders hat
you've got the hammer there
you've got the nails nuts and bolts
you've got the tool belt
there's no screwdriver either
oh Brian I'm sure it should have everything in it
there's the saw
clickety saw
oh yes
that makes a nice saw sound
but there's no screwdriver and no wrench „ is there
and that box was Sellotaped up „ wasn't it
well Sonia and Isabel but they'll be very disappointed if they think it wasn't
but I can't have dropped it „ can I
because I know you've taken the wrapping paper off
but it was tightly fastened up „ wasn't it
we've just taken the Sellotape off
and it's still Sellotaped up at the bottom
oh how funny
well there's one thing Brian
if we tell them it wasn't in there there might be some other kits that were a bit short
look
and there's your belt for putting all the tools on
that's a bit disappointing „ isn't it
there you are
ah ha ha ha before we get excited what are you holding there
the screwdriver and the adjustable wrench
I was getting all excited then about complaining to Woolworths and you're sitting on it
ThomasHenry

oh
and your hat as fallen off
look at this
screwdriver
oh
a hammer
look at this wrench
look at this wrench
right
do you needta put your belt on
your BobtheBuilder belt
this good because it as got velcro so you can adjust it
you'll probably need a bigger belt because of all this party food later on „ won't you
oh look
that says BobtheBuilder as well
let's clip it in to place
it's like the strap on your pushchair „ isn't it
and what are we doing with this
he has „ hasn't he
have you dropped something
right
now look
Bob puts all his tools in there like that „ doesn't he
look at that
do you wanna put your hammer in that one

so you've got a BobtheBuilder video
and you've got this box of BobtheBuilder toys from Isabel
do you
and you've got the Dizzy from Jo and Becky

you've got a BobtheBuilder jigsaw from JakeJimmy
Dizzy from Jo and Becky
and this from Isabel
and I think perhaps you'll get some other things this afternoon „ don't you
oh not the edge of the table Brian
Daddy'll be very cross
there you are
you can bang on that
and that
what do you wanna bang
I don't think that's nice banging that
how about banging the box

what's that banging
and you've got a BobtheBuilder birthday cake
it's BobtheBuilder

you look very smart with your BobtheBuilder belt on Brian
you've stopped for a little chat
it says a squeaky hammer but actually
does it squeak
oh yes
look on the box
the hammer is red and green and the one we've got is red and blue „ isn't it
oh not too loud
do you know what else it does
the hammer
let me show you
look
there's a little wrench on the end
so you can probably pull
you can lift screws up with it
and pull screws out of things
look
that's a good screwdriver „ isn't it
look
this turns round quite easily
do you wanna have go with that
you can do it
you put the screwdriver in there and turn round and round and round and round

do you know what happened on your first birthday
you were teething and you weren't very well
we had a party and your friends came round
and half way through the party you started to cry
you were so tired
Mummy gave you some Calpol
you know that special medicine
and I cuddled you
and within a few minutes you were going
and Daddy put you over his shoulder
and he carried you up to your cot and all your friends carried on with the party
and you were fast asleep in your cot
and then a lot of people went home
but when you woke up there was still Val and Stuart and Grandma and Grandad
and I think Jake and Georgia were here and Isabel
because they didn't wanna go home without seeing you again
and last year
I can't remember
oh it was a beautiful day
wasn't it a nice day last year
it was really hot and sunny and everybody played in the garden
and little Daniel was on the swing for hours „ wasn't he
and you got your slide „ didn't you
last year
that was from Grandma and Grandad
last year's birthday present
and everybody was going up and down the slide
Isabel enjoyed that
and this year it's a horrible day
wet and windy and cold and blowing

we won't go out in the cold and rain „ will we
today

I'm not putting my finger in your crocodile's mouth

and where as the digger man gone

oh just the little wooden trains go on there
I see
what am I asking
