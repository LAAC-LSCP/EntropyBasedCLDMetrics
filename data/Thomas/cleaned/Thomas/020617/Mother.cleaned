and I can only see one ladder
oh no
well I can see a ladder and a chair lift
right
would you like some RiceKrispies
a biscuit
you want a biscuit for breakfast
you're only saying you want a biscuit because you can see I've got them on the table „ haven't I

and there's a piece of Grandad birthday cake „ isn't there
no
you're not touching it
actually we've got masses of biscuits
I don't know why I've just opened a new packet
did you see how full the other tin was
we don't really eat biscuits „ do we
jolly good
let's check we've got enough tea
yes

don't sweep the crumbs on the floor
I don't like that Thomas
Mummy doesn't like you doing that
it's naughty „ isn't it
I don't like that
it's naughty
you don't wanna be a naughty boy today „ do you
at playgroup yesterday you were playing with a fire engine „ weren't you
two ladders
it had very big ladders „ didn't it
and then we went in for storytime „ didn't we
I think you were a bit disappointed because you ad only just discovered the fire engine
when they shouted story time
and I think you wanted to carry on playing with the fire engine „ didn't you
never mind
I'm going to make you some toast now Thomas
do you think you will be going into Stockport today or JohnLewis
no
you usually do „ don't you
but not today you don't think
pardon
JohnLewis is shut
oh no

and Grandma and Grandad said they were going to take you today to buy you some new shoes
what do you think to that
that sounds nice „ doesn't it
new shoes for Thomas
lucky boy „ aren't you
shoes for
more biscuits
would you not like some RiceKrispies
you would
well I think that's the better option than biscuits for breakfast
I've put some toast in the machine as well
you can have that with some marmalade „ can't you
we'll put some milk on your RiceKrispies this morning
and what as happened to your drink of juice
we had it „ didn't we
a while a go
oh it's here
look
there we are
where as the lock gone for the fridge Thomas
oh it's inside the fridge
fair enough
do you feel any better today
no better
you're poorly
oh dear
you have been poorly for the past few days „ haven't you
you've had a bad cold
oh dear dear
poor old Thomas
I think you're getting a bit better now though „ aren't you
is Thomas feeling better now
that sounded like a car pulling up
no
it wasn't
no car pulling up
that's a funny noise but it's not the noise from the RiceKrispies
it's the air trapped in your juice beaker „ isn't it
yes
is that what it's doing
making a squeaky sound

you're very dramatic Thomas
yes
alright
we got the picture
PostmanPat
did you see our Postman this morning
I thought you had
what happened to the letters
two PostmanPats
you saw the real life PostmanPat and you saw the PostmanPat on television
two PostmanPats
sorry poppet
has he finished
asleep
does he
did you have a nice night's sleep
yes
you woke up „ didn't you
when I came to bed
what a night last night
Mummy got into bed and Daddy put the pillow on her face
Daddy was still asleep but I hadta wake him up to move him
then Purdie was sick
I cleaned that up
and I got back into bed and I said to Daddy what's the beting Thomas wakes up within the next few minutes
and just as I said it guess what

excuse me
you woke up shouting Mummy
who woke up shouting Mummy
yes
like that
pardon
you came into Mummy and Daddy's bed „ didn't you
well we didn't actually
Daddy got up and came down here „ didn't he
we were all awake then
why are you shouting
why are you shouting Thomas
you shouldn't shout
right
where's the bin bag lorry
are you implying my kitchen looked messy

yes
well we're trying to get it tidied up
Mummy as got to get ready for work in a minute
I've got to
yes
the ice cream bus
well I really don't know what you're talking about now
an ice cream bus and a red bus
I think Mummy will pour herself a cup of tea and I'll get something to eat before I iron a skirt
Mummy's going to wear a skirt today Thomas
a RiceKrispie
what do you say about the RiceKrispie
you've found a RiceKrispie
where did you find it
on the table
had you dropped it out of the bowl
landed on the table
Grandma and Grandad are calling into the shops on the way here today to buy Purdie some food
because when I went to feed her I realized that we hadn't got any Whiskas
no Whiskas
we ad run out of Whiskas Thomas
all done Whiskas
tin of pussy cat food
Purdie as got whiskers on her face „ hasn't she
what else has she got
oh no
don't say that about Purdie
no
she hasn't
she's a little girl
she's a pussy cat
yes
that's right
she says she's a little girl pussy cat not a little boy pussy cat
we'll hafta try and find a fire engine that has an OpenDay soon Thomas
and take you to it
well there was one a few weeks ago and we were away at the time
something like that
we were going away
we didn't find out about it until afterwards
would you like to go and have a look at a real fire engine
because you like buss and we've been on a bus
you like trains and we've been to the Station
we've been on a train
and you like aeroplanes and we've been to the airport and on an aeroplane
we don't really want a fire engine coming to the house „ do we
because that'll mean there's big trouble
it's better if we can go and see a fire engine at the fire station
right
is Mummy allowed to sit down with you a few moments and have some breakfast
we get worse on Wednesdays Thomas „ don't we
rushing
rush
is that all we ever do
rush
what a rush
so I'll leave that tray Thomas
with Purdie's water bowl on it and a plate and a fork and then when Grandma comes with the pussy cat food we can feed her „ can't we
and if Mummy forgets Grandma can feed her and you can show her where the things are
you can say that's Purdie's water bowl
this is Purdie's plate
and this is the fork we use
I can't see the fork
yes
I can
here we are
that very big one
is the toast nice
is it not nice
dirty
it's not dirty
it as got Marmite on it
I was just shaking the duster outside because I used it last night
when I went to shake it the phone rang and I just left it on the washing machine
it's very windy out there this morning
it nearly blew me away
very windy
I bet there'll be a lot of leaves falling of the trees this morning
your swing's blowing in the breeze
can you see it
and if you look out of the front window can you see all the leaves blowing of those trees near Sue's house
more leaves falling
yes
it's nice to watch them „ isn't it
another leaf fall over too
off Thomas's trees
yes
we've been watching leaves falling off the trees near Sue's house and when we look out of the patio door we can see falling off our own trees „ can't we
do you remember going for that walk and picking up all the leaves
and we collected some from Jo and Becky's house „ didn't we
and some from our own garden and some from the park when we were walking back from toddler group
your nose sounds very blocked up Thomas
when you start to eat
are you stuffed up
little nose blocked
oh look I've just seen some more marks on the tablecloth
that must be out of the green paper
we used green yellow and red paper
or was it green blue and red paper „ wasn't it
and we used yellow paper but that was to cut a shape „ wasn't it
pardon
it's dye from the red paper
it as marked the cloth
I think it'll come out when we dry clean it
PostmanPat
PostmanPat's not on now „ is he
is the toast nice
no
Mummy made it especially for Thomas
