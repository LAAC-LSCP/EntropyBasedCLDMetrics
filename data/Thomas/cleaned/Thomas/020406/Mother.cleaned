when we were walking there this morning the rain was absolutely pouring down „ wasn't it
and you had your Wellingtons on
and we hadta have the rain cover on in the pushchair „ didn't we
splash water
yes
there was water everywhere
so when we go there we played inside
but then we stayed for lunch
and after lunch
we managed to go outside
and do some playing outside in the garden „ didn't we
because the rain stopped
but it was still very wet underfoot
you're all dry now
the rain as all done
there's no rain now „ is there

you've got all your toys spread on the floor „ haven't you
well not all your toys
but it's all your trucks and diggers and racing cars and helicopters
and things like that

you were playing this morning with Isabelle in a garage „ weren't you
a toy garage
when Mummy was a little girl she useta enjoy playing with a garage
I useta enjoy playing with a farm as well
and Isabelle had some little animals „ didn't she
that belonged on a farm
and Mummy realized that we've got the same ones
but they're only quite small animals
so Mummy put them in a box out of the way
but we've brought them downstairs now
so we might have a look at them in a few minutes
car „ isn't it

little blue mini
Granddad bought you that little blue mini „ didn't he
stop

when the light's on red we hafta stop
when it's on amber it's wait a minute
and when it's on green what happens

we can go „ can't we
and when we're crossing the road
the little red man comes on „ doesn't he
to tell us to stop
and then the green man comes on
and what happens then
go
we can go
that's right
the blue one's at the back
you've put the blue mini behind the racing car
so when something's behind something it's at the back
oh have you come to sit on Mummy's knee
open Mummy's tummy

do you need your nappie changing yet
well I think fairly soon we needta change your nappie
and have a little sleep

because the parts are very small „ aren't they
what's this now

I'll let you off because you don't know what you're saying
Thomas

a sign
and it says home farm
oh dear
what as happened now
oh has the nappie fallen on the floor
do you need your nappie changing

I think Mummy should have paid a little more attention to how Isabelle's farm house was made
because I can't work out how to do this
oh Thomas
they've come off all together now
oh I think we've managed
oh no we haven't
I was just about to say we've managed to do this now

Thomas is sorry

ohgosh

are you having a good look in your toy box
what can you find Thomas
you're quite quiet „ aren't you
you concentrating
oh you've found the balls now „ have you

oh and are you going to let them talk to Purdie on the telephone
do you think they'd like to talk to Purdie
right
well just be careful „ won't you
oh yes
no

I think you perhaps could do with a sleep „ don't you
who else are you going to talk to on the telephone
Sonia
well would you like to thank Sonia for a nice day
bye bye Sonia and Isabelle
were you telling them Daddy was working at the chip shop
no

oh look who as come home now
Daddy
Daddy doesn't really work at a chip shop „ does he
are we going to talk to him when he comes in
they're little haystacks
look there's the farm
there are some trees
and a wheelbarrow
and a haystack and a windmill
yellow wheelbarrow
you had a nice day so far
we've been in Sonia's car
it's a windmill
a windmill
no
it's a windmill
look
look
when the wind blows the sails go round
and those are the haystacks
and some trees
and what do you think these are Thomas
I think they're sposta be plants „ aren't they
yes
we're still trying to work out how to do the
upstairs
there must be a little knack to it that Mummy can't work out
perhaps that's it
oh no
don't throw the trees
you throwing all the trees
it's a windmill
it sounds like you're saying an ice cream bus
but it's a windmill Thomas
now
yes
in this bag we've got all the animals
and the fences „ haven't we
what
it's the fence
look we've got horses
and cows
and pigs
and sheep
look at these little hens
that's a horse
what does the horse say
moo
they're all different are they
look at all the cows
open the lid
what have we got here
well they're lego bricks „ aren't they
thank you
Mummy's looking at all the cows
blue ones
red ones
green ones
oh look
there are a lot of cows on the farm „ aren't there
there are a lot of sheep
and there are horses
baby horses are called foals
and there are a lot of foals I think
because they're very small horses
and lotsof ducks and geese
and I'm really not quite sure what those animals are
perhaps they're goats
because they're not sheep are they
now does this remind you of Sunday
when we went to the park
do you remember seeing that big pig
and she had all those piglets
she had all those little pigs
it's the windmill
you wanna play
you wanna sleep
or shall we play together
Mummy do it
you want Mummy to set up the farm
well shall we do it together
I think you're getting tired actually
you getting to be a tired boy
you pulling my hair
no
don't hurt Mummy
that's not nice „ is it
all done now
you're playing with the telephone again now „ aren't you
that's the farmhouse
and the stables
what have we got here
they're haystacks
what's
no Thomas
look if we put them all there inside this lid all the will get lost
there's the haystacks in the field
and the windmill
Thomas
stop it

that's making a lot of noise now Thomas
do it on the floor please Thomas
we can build a fence now Thomas
and the fence separates all the animals „ doesn't it
look you're going to fall Thomas
don't climb up on boxes
what animals shall I put in here Thomas
should we put the horses in here
the horses
look
that one looks like it's washing
they don't stand up very well „ do they
and look at all these
tiny foals
the baby horses are called foals „ aren't they
we've not really played with the toys inside for a long time „ have we
because the weather as been so nice
have you found your doll
has she got a big tummy
a big willie
I don't think she has Thomas
she's a little girl
we've called her Sue
I don't think Sue has a willie „ do you
we could get some bread Thomas
to play
there's ducks on the duck pond
oh are you sitting your dolly Sue on her potty
have we got some hens outside of the farm
they're picking up corn from the floor
Mummy's doing it
and we've got more ducks on the pond
and we've got all those horses in the field
and their little foals
and there are a lot of sheep and a lot of pigs
what are baby sheep called
lambs
baby lambs
pigs live in stys Thomas
we saw that big pig on Sunday
she had all those piglets „ didn't she
what are you doing now
I thought you were
because you've gone very quiet
you've hidden behind a chair „ haven't you
well tell Mummy when you've finished
and we'll change your nappie
paper
oh yes
you've got the post box there „ haven't you
postman comes
I don't think we've got anything to post in the letterbox today „ have we
we usually have something
are you alright Thomas
you're having a wee wee now
and a poo
oh at least I know what you're doing
you want Mummy's purse
well be careful
can you reach it
oh well done
here it is
what color are all these little pigs Thomas
what color
pink pigs
don't lose any of the money out of Mummy's purse „ will you
oh thank you
that's one penny
one penny
Mummy's still busy putting the farm together „ isn't she
you're counting all the money
have we been to the market with some of these pigs
and you're counting all the money
did farmer sell some of his pigs at the market
and you're counting all the money
oh Thomas
have you seen what you've just done
what has Thomas just done
you're clumsy „ aren't you
is Thomas clumsy
yes
no
don't put it on there Thomas
because it will scratch the surface „ won't it
Thomas is very clumsy
because he as just walked right through the middle of the farm
are you taking the money from Mummy's purse to go shopping
show Mummy
I can't see
what is it
a pea
I don't think it's a pea
black pea
no Thomas
are you coming to look at some of these things
I don't think we need the big truck out as well „ do you
we've got so many things on the floor
Thomas
what're you doing
no
don't climb
you're going to hurt yourself
are you saying bye bye Mummy
do you not want me to come round the back of the chair with you
well I'm going to gather all this money together
because you're going to lose it
and if we wanna go the shops
and we'll get there and the purse will be empty
and the shopkeeper won't sell us anything
we won't be able to pay for anything „ will we
have you finished doing what you were doing now
so could we change you
no
you don't want changing
I think you do really Thomas
because you're a bit smelly „ aren't you
poo
poo
is there a little red balloon
I bet most of the air as come out of it now „ hasn't it
you do know you've got to pick all these things up in a few minutes
look at the floor
what a mess
is there a big mess
I think we could probably use one of the old nappie wipe boxes as a storage box for this farm set
think that's a good idea
very quiet
what are you doing
you've found a big moon
a baby one
no
don't drop any more out Thomas
it's going to take too long to tidy up
would you like to come and start putting these animals in the box
Mummy do it
oh poor Mummy
she as hadta put the farm together
play with it on her own
and now tidy it up on her own
I don't think there's room for a big truck
big digger coming
well let me help you lift it over here
there you are
oops a daisy
that's your racing car „ isn't it
you're looking puzzled
can you not find the rest of the car
where's the racing car
it's here look
you see what we do with this
put that on the back there
and where's the racing driver
is this him
and we sit him in the car
and somewhere I thought there was a medal
I thought there was a cup that the racing car driver won
when he won the race
but I can't see it „ can you
right
now stand back
we press that and
oh
off he goes
push that in
now you press it
oh
again Thomas
that's it
have we lost the little cup that the man wins when he wins the race
no pop
no pop
does it not pop every time
no pop
Mummy do it
that's why it's not poping
because you've got to press that in first
and then pop
right
you do it
now press
that's
no
press that in first
that's better
that's it
you've got to press the red brick in
all the way
oh it's not working because you've put your hand in front of it
now press it
that's it
I'm looking for the box with all the lego things in
I'd like to see if we can find the medal
we seem to have lost a lot of toys recently
the little wooden bricks though from the shape sorter turned up „ didn't they
can you hear Daddy walking about upstairs
is Daddy
there's noone there
no
there's the cup
that's what the man wins
look
when he wins the race
we'll stick it on there
pop it on the back
oh yes
that's splendid „ isn't it
oh this is keeping you nice and amused
a big noise
yes
that's it
I'm not surprised he as won a cup
because he's a very good driver „ isn't he
is it a gold cup that he as won
a gold cup
that must be the best prize possible
there is a mess down here
I quite agree
I think we oughta start picking some of the things up
is that the pussy cat
no Thomas
don't start banging
because Daddy's upstairs
if Daddy hears you banging he'll be cross „ won't he
I think we'll pack this farm away Thomas
and we'll get a different box to store it in
and we won't keep it down here with your other toys
we'll put it away
because then it's something different to look at
if you have all your toys out together you lose interest „ don't you
another time when we have a look at the animals on the farm we'll hafta see if you've got a favorite animal
and we'll hafta give it a name
Thomas don't start throwing things
yes
Thomas has pooed
there's an awful smell
no
Thomas don't
you're going to scratch my back
that's not nice
no
you've got to wait to do that
we've got to go upstairs and get you changed in a minute
and do you think it's time for you to sleep
no
not to touch that
because you've had a busy day „ haven't you
today
who've you been playing with
no
we've not been to Stockport
who've you been playing with this morning
Isabelle
Thomas
you're not to touch the stereo
it's naughty
Isabelle
and who else
does that balloon shine
and Rachel and Jonathan
and did you have something to eat
did we have a picnic inside
you're falling over because there are so many things on the floor
bye bye Thomas
in the kitchen
wash your hands
tea ready
right
are you going to get off
and Mummy can put the top back on
the lid off the table
that's right
you put it on
that's a good boy
that's a good boy
then we can put the abacus and the shape sorter back on top of it
those balloons have shrunk a lot „ haven't they
yes
oh that's a new one
this one
oh don't pop them
that's left from your birthday balloon
it's a yellow balloon with a picture of Lala
and her ball
but this balloon
oh it has popped
has WinniethePooh on it
it's broken now
I'll hafta mend it „ won't we
I can't think where you got the WinniethePooh balloon from
was it from Bethany's party
I can't remember
but we haven't had it so long
has it hurt your finger
pop
right
I've just broken WinniethePooh balloon
but it was very flat anyway
it has gone
quite small „ hadn't it
right
one Thomas
right
would Thomas like to go to the shops
oh yes
well Thomas
I think Thomas has spent all Mummy's money this morning
he as had Mummy's purse
and we've had money everywhere „ haven't we
so I think if we go to the shops we won't have any pennys left
Purdie's at the door
look Thomas
wanting to come in
no
what're you doing
