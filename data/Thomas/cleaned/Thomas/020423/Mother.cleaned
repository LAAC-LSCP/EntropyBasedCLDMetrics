you're tired so you wanna sit on Mummy's knee and have a bath
you've just got up
what happened this morning
you came into Mummy and Daddy's bed „ didn't you
and what happened to Purdie
yes
you kissed her but why did you kiss her
you kissed her like that but what happened to make you kiss her
she's back outside now
she came into Mummy and Daddy's bedroom at the same time and tried to jump into the window „ didn't she
fall down
she fell down „ didn't she
and that woke Daddy up
and you went to comfort Purdie and you woke up Mummy and Daddy and Daddy was cross „ wasn't he
a big mess
there was a big mess when Purdie fell „ wasn't there
because she knocked some things of Daddy's bedside cabinet
and you wouldn't settle then so you came downstairs
and you had a drink of milk
pardon
what about a tail
and in the end we came downstairs and you had some milk „ didn't you
because you wouldn't settle and then you went back to sleep on the sofa and you ad only just woken up
but the thing is Thomas
we've got some things to do today
no
we're not going on a green bus
you've got a green bus in your jigsaw but there aren't any green buss in Manchester
red bus
there might be some green buss in Manchester but not the ones that we take
is it Purdie
Purdie's outside in the garden
can you see her
is she looking at the trees
pardon
no
Purdie doesn't brush trees
Purdie's a good girl in the garden
is she coming back in
I don't think she's coming back in
I think she's going to her favorite place to peep through the fence at Felix and Tiddles and Molly
can you see that big slug
put it in the bin with some paper
oh that's it
when they're dead Mummy picks them up „ doesn't she
with paper and puts them in the bin
but that one's not dead
a butterfly
where's there a butterfly
I can see a bee on the ladder though
can you see this bee
buzzing around
right
let's have some breakfast
because we're going on the bus this morning
and then this afternoon if the weather's nice we'll go to the Beehive in Didsbury
because you've not really seen any friends this week „ have you
would you like to do that
okay
you've got a spot on your face Thomas
pardon
oh can you see that slug going up the chair
it's crawling up the leg of the garden chair
ooh
not nice „ is it
don't ever touch slugs „ will you
butterfly
caterpillar
it's a slug
it looks like a very big caterpillar „ doesn't it
do you remember your story about the very hungry caterpillar
oh I see
on AuntyMabel and Pippin there's something about butterflys and caterpillars „ is there
yellow one
oh I see
talking about yellow one
you were walking round before with your yellow helmet on
I don't know what you're saying Thomas
buzzy bee
caterpillar
that slug's fascinating „ isn't it
they're horrible things but they're quite clever „ aren't they
look how he as crawled up the leg of the chair
and it's turning round now
it's in a u shape
it's tail's off the floor and it's clinging
hold the chair
and it as left a trail
can you see that little trail where it as crawled on the patio
it's like a caterpillar
but it's not
it's not going to turn into a butterfly
yes
it's coming down again now „ isn't it
no changing
no
it won't be changing
not Pippin on and changing
you've seen on AuntyMabel and Pippin „ have you
caterpillars changing into butterflys
a few minutes ago I thought it was going to be very sunny and it as gone quite dull now
what's what darling
it's the same slug
it's just doing different things „ isn't it
Purdie face
what's she doing
a bee near Purdie's face
I'm going to just have a look over the fence to see what it is that Purdie's staring at
oh I can't see
she must be watching Felix
I think
on the patio door
look up here
look at this
what's this
a butterfly
no
that's a Daddy long legs
look at how really long it's legs are
it as got one two three four five six legs
two wings
you've seen one of those on Pippin as well „ have you
you're going to fall off the coffee table in a minute if you're not careful
don't climb up
it's like a spider „ isn't it
but it flies
they come in especially at night like moths
when the lights on
outside they
yes
like a moth
are you going to have some cornflakes
hello moth
down
oh yes
it as come off the chair and it's going towards Purdie „ isn't it
it's probably not bothered
those slugs eat Mummy's plants Thomas
they eat the green leafs
you're watching it „ are you
it's going to disappear at the moment behind the plant pot „ isn't it
then we can't see it
it's a Daddy long legs Thomas
what was that story about the moth and the butterfly
come on poppet
cornflakes now please
in your chair
and then you can watch teletubbies later
you're not happy
you wanna take this off
you wanna take your cardigan off
and when we got up this morning Thomas
before six o'clock it was a little bit chilly so Mummy put that cardigan on you but it's alright for in the house but you couldn't wear it
oh it says three to six months Thomas
three to six months
gosh you were a lot smaller than that when you were three to six months
big box of cornflakes
I think they must have got the size wrong because you were only wearing that
Thomas eat it
well I've got a bowl ready for you
there
look
would you like a spoon
or are you just going to use your fingers
I didn't think we'd bother putting milk on today because
we've not really been eating a lot of food
and we've already had some milk this morning
you quite enjoy them when they're crunchy „ don't you
Thomas do it
you wanna do your straps
pardon
down there
that's the one
yes
and where did you go yesterday with Grandma and Grandad
Blackpool
no
you didn't
the Centre
you went to the TraffordCentre „ didn't you
TraffordCentre to do some shopping
was it a nice day
you had a good time
pop your bib on
bib on
oh well done
you've done your straps all on your own
well done
would you like a spoon sweetheart
no
fingers
okay
and would you like orange juice or blackcurrant juice
orange
what do you say
orange
good boy
you missed the postman as well this morning because you were asleep
but having said that
when the letters came through the door I heard you say something
did you see the red bus then
yes
yes
Ray came
you were asleep on Mummy's knee
but I think
yes
he didn't wave this morning but when there was a big bang when the letter fell through the letterbox you said something about the postman
I can't remember what it was but
ohgosh the patio door's stuck Thomas
and I can't open it
Purdie's outside
oh there we are

oh there she is
Percy
Purdie
oh are you saying pussy perhaps
it sounded like Percy
oh she's having some breakfast now
talking of which
it's a long time since Mummy had her breakfast
so I think I'll have something now
I had a drink earlier on
well Thomas where as the sun gone
is there a mess
well she's eating

excuse me
little chunks of food

on to the floor
not to worry because she as got a tray underneath
but when you drop something on the floor you shouldn't eat it „ should you
but if Purdie knocks some food off her plate it goes onto the tray underneath so we can just pick it up with a fork
pardon
all done food
has she finished eating
and you didn't see daddy go to work this morning „ did you
because you were asleep
are you going to eat something poppet
some cornflakes
bless you
oh that was a put on sneeze
I don't think you've really got a cold „ have you
Mummy what darling
what about the orange juice
oh right
the train passed the orange juice
you're playing with your yellow train you've just wheeled it past the orange „ haven't you
on the table
have you got a cough Thomas
I know the sneeze sounded false but have you got a cough
oh you're just making it up
cornflakes now
the train's going to pass the cornflakes
are you going to give the man some cornflakes
shall I put these pieces of cheese in the back of the train
it is clean because I washed it last night
here you are man
is the man eating your cornflakes
do you think Purdie would like a little piece of cheese
no
Purdie's eating some cheese already Thomas
you eat that cheese
is that the cornflakes stuck
oh you've taken the driver out of the carriage and then you were tipping the cornflakes straight into your mouth „ weren't you
oh right
it looks like Purdie's all done as well
bye bye Puss
see you tomorrow
did you say see you tomorrow
Thomas don't just play with your train
why don't you eat something Thomas
you really haven't eaten
much food for quite a few days
come on
look
the driver
mm
look
he's bringing you a cornflake especially for you
oh
he wants you to eat it
look
he's bringing another one to you
what do you say
thank you driver
oh he as taken a piece of cheese out of the back of the train
mm
here you are Thomas
oh what a nice driver
the driver's really worried about you because he said Thomas normally loves his breakfast even if he doesn't eat a lot during the rest of the day
he likes his breakfast
and he said I've noticed that he as not been eating his cornflakes and his cheese
open the door
has he got back in the carriage
what about his mouth
oh look
have you shown him
have you opened your mouth and shown him that you're eating something
let's turn the train round and then the driver can look straight into your mouth
open your mouth
oh yes
he said that's very clever
he said here you are
have another piece of cheese
oh that's a nice driver „ isn't it
looking after you
making sure you have plenty to eat
all done cheese
would you like some more cheese
now let's see if the train driver can find anymore cheese
are you going to ask him to drive to another station and you might find some cheese there
oh
look
he as loaded some more cheese into the back of the train
Mummy's going to have some marmalade on her toast
I've not had marmalade for a long time
would you like some milk on the cornflakes or are they alright as they are
you're going to eat cheese
I think Purdie wants to come back in
no
no
close the door
she's obviously quite happy sitting on the mat
it's quite warm outside though
and it's better really that she can be out
because when it's very wet or very cold and windy she doesn't like to be outside
we've got to organize what we're going to do with with Purdie when we go to Spain
because when we go on our holiday Purdie as got to go on hers Thomas
do you remember the other day we were looking at Liam's Mummy putting the two pussy cats into a basket into the car
and we thought they were going on their holiday
yes
they might have been going to the vets because they were poorly
but when we go away we're going to hafta do something with Purdie
but Grandma's poorly at the moment and needs to go into hospital
so it might be that Grandma's in hospital when we're on holiday
she might be better
and if Grandma can't have her we'll hafta take her to a pussy cat hotel
she as been in Catterys before so she doesn't mind too much but it's better if she can stay with Grandma „ isn't it
because then she as got the freedom to run around
because when she goes to the Cattery she as got to stay in a little pen
and the Cattery we go to Thomas
it has a little pen inside where she has a bed and her food
and her litter tray
but then she can climb up a piece of wood and go through a cat flap and go outside into an enclosure
or she can run around
pardon
what darling
David and Sharon
what about David and Sharon
oh yes
they gave you some Smarties „ didn't they
on Saturday
here I am talking about cat flaps Thomas
and you're off on a tangent about Smarties

tummy
yes
I think it's all you think about sometimes
Smarties and your tummy
would you like some more orange juice
no
don't mess with them Thomas
eat them up
yellow fish
you saw some yellow fish at the TraffordCentre with Grandma and Grandad yesterday „ didn't you
did they not open their mouths wide
I see
Purdie's washing herself outside
are you bringing the cheese to me in the train
oh thank you
I've got a piece of cheese here
thank you Thomas
that's right
we've each got a piece „ haven't we
one Thomas and one Mummy
two peas
yellow fish no open wide
did they open their mouths
machine
what machine Thomas
you saw a machine in the ShoppingCentre „ did you
what sort of machine
a blue one
what sort of machine
was it cleaning the floor
was it
with brushes
oh you saw a big red truck
does it taste good
you saw a train on a bridge through the trees
a pink one
a pink train
oh
are you sure it wasn't red
it was a blackcurrant one
oh right
and where was that
at Tesco
because you can usually see the trains on the bridge through the trees at EastDidsburyTesco „ can't you
did you go to Tesco with Grandma and Grandad yesterday on your way out
Grandma's at home this morning
Grandma's house
we'll ring her later
you can talk to her on the telephone
Purdie's big feet
paws
are you talking about when she fell this morning
what happened
Mummy had been doing some cleaning yesterday and I'd moved the things on Daddy's bedside cabinet
and I ad put a pile of glossy magazines
quite near the window
and Purdie jumped as she normally does to get into the window onto Daddy's bedside cabinet
and she couldn't get past all the things put there and then she
yes
a blue truck
and she jumped onto the pile of magazines and they all slipped and she fell „ didn't she
a big bash
magazines and Purdie everywhere
and Daddy wasn't very pleased
but you went to comfort Purdie „ didn't you
I think you waking up woke Purdie up
Purdie falling out of the window woke Daddy up
hello
are you saying hello to the driver
hello driver
where've you been
just one train „ isn't it
do you want me to play with it
if I push it back towards you
would you like some toast Thomas
pardon
no marmalade
you'd like some toast without marmalade
well we're not putting Pippin on now
but the teletubbies will be on in a few minutes
would you like me to peel you some fruit and you could have some fruit and watch teletubbies
we haven't any peaches but we've got some grapes
grapes apples bananas
that's what we've got
what would you like
no
grapes apples bananas
yummy
yummy in your tummy
and I'll give you some more juice
and you might as well have the grapes because there aren't many grapes
and then if you still want something else I'll peel an apple for you
what's Purdie doing now
I don't know
I can't see her
oh yes
I can
she's back at the fence watching Felix
is she going to jump from the fence
it's orange juice
I thought you wanted orange
oh well have some blackcurrant at lunchtime
there aren't many grapes this morning Thomas
when we go to the shop we'll hafta buy some more
well I'll cut them in half and they look to be few more than there really are
yes
we're going to the shops to buy some more „ aren't we
there you are treasure
okay
how's that
shall we have a little break now and watch teletubbies
so that was a bit of a bonus „ wasn't it
after teletubbies what happened
what came on after teletubbies
you wanna sleep
oh the teletubbies were sleeping „ weren't they
what was happening
they were all lying down
LaLa what

LaLa in particular
she was in bed a lot „ wasn't she
and then what did they say
wake up
what were they using to wake Po up
were they using a bugle
what was it going

was it doing that
but what happened after the teletubbies
what came on the television that we weren't expecting
PostmanPat
that was exciting „ wasn't it
the big van
yes
we weren't expecting PostmanPat „ were we
he was only on for about five minutes but it was
and Jess
what happened to Jess Thomas
come on Jess
come on Jess
and sit down
oh that was very exciting „ wasn't it
we really didn't
I don't think we've seen PostmanPat before on television
I have but not with you
in fact we've got a PostmanPat book „ haven't we
that we bought the other week
what's our postman called
what's our postman called
Jess
no
our postman's called Ray
because I think this morning on PostmanPat did it not say that Pat was busy waving to his customers
and Ray waves to us „ doesn't he
you look quite pale today Thomas Lastname
do you not feel very well
I tell you what
let's clear away this apple
and get rid of the cornflakes

what a mess now
what's the train doing
he's driving with your help through the cornflakes that you've just tipped onto the table
oh dear
what's broken
no
the train hasn't broken
I tell you what Thomas
in the Lego catalogue that I was looking at yesterday you can build a little track and a bridge in Lego for that train
so I think we might talk very nicely to Daddy and see if Daddy will go to the shop or we could go to the shop „ couldn't we
but if Daddy goes to the shop daddy will pay for it „ won't he
yes
is that cheeky of Mummy
Mummy cheeky
did you just say sorry Mummy
and you gave me a kiss
why were you saying sorry

there ad been an accident „ hadn't there
a big bash

you saw it
no go
oh dear
was there a big bash and then the car stopped
his head
you saw it
all done
it didn't sound very nice to me
and the police car went racing past with his siren and his light
and then a few minutes later you saw him
that's what he was saying
shall we just wash your hands
two beebas
what love
you watched Pippin on beebas
are you talking about the fire engine on the AuntyMabel and Pippin program
but it wasn't a fire engine you saw yesterday
and did you see an ambulance as well
and that was saying beeba as well „ was it

and you've watched PostmanPat
and I think that's enough „ don't you
yes
you can't sit in front of the television all day Thomas
you enjoyed what you watched „ didn't you
but you won't enjoy it if you just sit there all the time
it won't be anything new
right
let's brush these teeth clean
do you not wanna brush them
just remember all those Smarties and all that juice you're eating
it's no good Thomas
you've got to have your teeth brushed
Jess
here's Jess the pussy cat
she wants to
she wants to watch you having your teeth brushed
she's having her teeth brushed
we do down with the top ones
she's opening wide
there we are
round and round
like this
let me show you
this is what we did with Jess
there we are
we'll do
I'm doing Thomas's teeth now just like I did Jess's
I'll rinse it under the tap
ah are you giving Jess a cuddle and a kiss
what else did they have in PostmanPat's PostOffice this morning in Greendale
it wasn't just letters
they had parcels „ didn't they
ah are you giving Jess a cuddle
top ones again
no
just let's just finish brushing yours first then I'll go back and brush Jess's
there you are poppet
no
just let me rinse it before Jess has her teeth brushed again
listen
when we brush Jess's teeth though we don't do it quite the same as yours
we don't actually touch her mouth
there
now don't try and do this on Purdie „ will you
because Purdie goes to vet to have her teeth done
we don't use your toothbrush on Purdie „ do we
that's right
that's lovely
is Jess having her teeth cleaned
well Pippin went to the vet to have her teeth cleaned and AuntyMabel
open wide
is that what the Dentist says
open wide
well I drew the blinds before because when you were watching teletubbies the sun was shining so brightly that we had a job to see the television
it's a shame to keep the sun out „ isn't it
all done Jess
Jess has had her teeth brushed „ has she
I think when we next go shopping Thomas
we needta buy a new sponge and facecloth for you
they're getting a bit tatty „ aren't they
right
shall we have a look at this book now
let's do it without the music though
we'll just look at the book
pardon
the red bus
it says RoyalMailE R
E R two
that's for QueenElizabeth
yes
Jess is sitting in the back of the post van „ isn't she
and that's MissusGoggins
she runs the PostOffice
and Pat as obviously collected all the letters from the postbox outside the PostOffice
shall I read it to you
oh we'll play the music afterwards
yes
let's just read the story
and look at all these things
PostmanPat's van
the lady on the bicycle
the gentleman on a motorbike
the man on a tractor and another man driving a shop
Sam's MobileShop
inside that van Thomas
he as got all sorts of things that you buy
he might have vegetables and fruit and bread and milk
that looks like a little boy putting a saucer of milk down on the floor for Jess
a cockerel crows
cockadoodledoo
what does it say
yes
they're green ones „ aren't they
not yellow ones
not red ones
they're green Wellingtons
look
and what's that
cockadoodledoo
can you see the farmer sitting on the stool milking the cow
when you have milk on your cereal and drink milk in a bottle
it comes from a cow
I can see a Police man
the Policeman's standing in the road helping the children cross
now what are they all bringing Grandma
presents and flowers
and chocolates and fruit because it's her birthday
we went to a birthday party last Thursday „ didn't we
happy birthday
I think it was last Thursday
are you dancing and kicking
don't kick
oh dear
Jess has fallen off the table „ hasn't she
this is the book that when you press the button it plays PostmanPat's tune „ doesn't it
there's a van about to drive past
I can hear it
did you see it go past
you wan to play the tune again
hello darling
pardon
I can't tell what you're saying
there's a man on a tractor „ isn't there
a big machine a big tractor Nana and Grandad
you must be talking about your trip out yesterday
what can you see in that room Thomas
a little boy and a little girl eating their breakfast
cornflakes
that's right
there's a box of cornflakes on the table
it says
Tom and Katy eat cereal for their breakfast
do you think she has milk on it
no
I think Tom must have had milk
oh mind you
Tom's giving a bowl of milk to Jess the cat so perhaps the milk that Tom should have had on his cornflakes well Katy should have had on hers they're giving to Jess
Thomas's
isn't it funny how many books we read and the little boys are called Tom
because we've got your favorite books Tom and Hippoq
that's a Tom
and this book Tom and Katy
which is quite funny because if you ad been a little girl you were going to be called Katy of Kate
Thomas Lastname
oh
I've just banged my toe on the table leg
ouch
ouchyouchyouchy
oh dear
Mummy's going to
ah are you kissing me better
you're so affectionate Thomas
here you are
what's Jess for really Thomas
she's for doing this with
she's a neck hugger
you put her round her neck
you got that from Mothercare when you were a baby
you were only about four months old or perhaps even less
I don't think you should of maybe had it when you were quite so young
there you are
you put it round your neck like that
it's neck snuggler
and then when you're in the car and you to sleep instead of your head going and falling all over the place
Jess cuddles your neck
the only trouble is
when we went on a very long journey it was August and it was a jolly hot day
it was too hot to have a furry pussy cat round your neck
but still Jess goes in the car with us „ doesn't she
I think she needs a wash actually
her black coat at the top is made of a velvet type material and it as got all sorts of white
and her white tummy looks a bit grubby
let me just see if we can wash her
it says
PostmanPat Mothercare hand wash
so we can give Jess a wash
oh no
don't pull the label off otherwise Mummy won't know „ will she
Nana and Grandad would be cross „ would they
oh
what color are Jess's eyes
they're not pink
are you wearing her on your head „ are you
look
she as got green eyes a pink nose and her coat's black and white
who does she remind you of
who do we know that's black and white
a white tail
well a white tip on the end of her black tail
who do we know that's black and white
what's UncleBrian's pussy cat called
Felix is black and white
that's right
Mummy sit down
next to you
is that what you'd like
well I'll sit down in a minute poppet
