what are you saying
magic sofa
I wouldn't sit on that because it might break
right
Tesco truck
any ideas where we're looking
his tow truck from Tesco
oh we're always changing boxes „ aren't we
right
how about this draw
is that the very one
you need the cup don't you
no
I haven't got your little Tesco counter there
A hasn't got a cap either
yeah
oh right
you've just lost a green lorry
that's okay
hm
the easiest thing is just to get the box out with the green truck
and put it
on to that
there we are
mhm
are they both Scaner
we'll hafta look at that but we're going on the red train next
to see if Tesco lorries really are Scaners
this
wheel
doesn't seem to go on quite so well
does it need screwing on or
hit
well you're surrounded by trucks and I might have a go at a jigsaw while you're doing that
please don't
well no I'd like to go have a go at one
hm you might do
right
yes uhhuh
you can do if they fit
I think they should do „ shouldn't they
right
jolly good
right
I've just popped a blob of BlueTac on that wheel Thomas

it seems to work all right
let's just try this
your EarlyLearningCentre lorry
right
do you want that left out then
alright
okay
well if you're playing with trucks I'll have a go at this jigsaw
well I might do the fire engine one
would you help me do the fire engine one
oh we've got a disaster
the battery's running out on the microphone
I just saw the light
blue
I love
I love you
I love you
I thought that's what you were going to sing a little rhyme
blue blue I love you
I am silly
I just walked all the way upstairs to get a battery
the batteries are downstairs because
don't you
ugh
that's even less silly
well the microphone battery went on the other microphone
and I should really have changed them both at the same time but I didn't
I only changed the one
that ran out
and now this one's run out
right
fitted and working
what are you pretending to be now
well you're lying on the floor with some trucks but I don't know what you are
Thomas don't be cheeky please
well a Tesco driver yes
but you could be the man that repairing the Tesco lorry
you could be
I don't know
if
if you're a Tesco petrol tanker driver then all you do is fill up with petrol and go to the petrol stations at Tesco
if you drive one of those big lorries you've probably got all sorts of nice things in the back
and you hafta go to the supermarkets and deliver everything
what do you think you are
both
you're both
you'll be a very busy man then
do you
well you're a superman then in that case
oh is it
hm I didn't know that

that's a good little shed
what were you saying
move out of the way
men out of the way
sorry what we're you saying
oh do they
who's Roy
Roy the builder
Roy the Early learning bus
well I'm doing this jigsaw from Marks and Spencers
I do yes

are you
oh dear why
because you think Mummy will always be there
women's things
is that what Nanna makes you do
look at women's things in Marks and Spencers
well I think this is a busy route that I'm making
this jigsaw has ten
big cardboard cut outs of vehicles
well
oh dear
I thought the fire brigade would be involved somewhere
and each of these vehicles
taxis fire engines buses
yes
they each have a number on them „ don't they
and the number on the fire engine number nine
how many firemen are in the fire engine
nine
how many people are on the bus
very good
that's a nice blue that Tesco lorry
is that the one that UncleDavid bought you
you've swapped the cabs „ have you
ahhah that's why it looks very blue
yes
it doesn't really look like the Tesco lorry that you see on the road „ does it
does it not fit properly
no
it doesn't look strange
I just thought it looked a beautiful blue lorry
but of course that's the difference cause usually the cabs are white „ aren't they
that's fine that's okay
it's fine by me
right
you know what we could do one day with these as well
we could actually draw round them with stencils and color them in
is that the supermarket
I do
oh is it
okay
what nice things have you got in Tesco truck Thomas
wow
doughnuts and crisps
mm
sultanas
coke
brandy you
and brandy and coke
who've you heard
oh right
who do you know that drinks brandy and coke
David
I don't think so
don't be silly you always
this is a record we heard on the radio one evening „ isn't it „ coming home

look the wheel's bent look
look the wheel's dropped off sweetheart
don't drop it
collapsed
it was a record about a man driving his truck with his
no

a man driving his truck with his high heels on „ wasn't he
driving my truck
with my high heels on
I bet you can't really drive a truck with your high heels because of all the pedals
you've got to work your feet on the pedals
and I don't think many lorry drivers wear high heels
well lady drivers I still don't think would wear any high heels when they were driving trucks Thomas
that's right
it's hard to drive in high heels
which is why when Mummy drives I've got some flat scruffy shoes that I have in the car
because apart from it being hard to put the pedals down you ruin all the back of your heels on the bottom of the car when you're putting the pedals down
and apart from that whether its a man or lady if their driver drops
say you were going to Tesco and you had all those huge trollies to push in full of boxes
that you've unloaded from your wagon
you wouldn't like to trip around in high heels like I do „ would you
you would
you'd fall over and break your ankle „ wouldn't you
would you
if the trolley fell on your head
yeah
you could yeah
and it could be slippery really „ couldn't it
Thomas where's vehicle number four
how many police people are in the car
four
oh is are you thinking that's a limousine
well it is a limousine „ isn't it
but it's a black car rather than
rather than a nice white wedding car
that why you were saying
kiss the bride
is it
that's right
well I think people driving through the night still need petrol
but I quite agree
there's going to be far more people at the petrol station during the day „ aren't there
right
and I've made this jigsaw look on the floor
all these
all these vehicles
is it
oh wow I keep
losing the vehicles off this track
ah
ah that's what's missing
what sort of car do you think that is Thomas
cause it
well I don't
hm I don't think that's a Ford Fiesta
it's like a Ford galaxy
a people carrier type thing
that looks like Sister Eileen same hair
do you think so
ah right
shall we put
ahhah
is this where they're all stopped
Thomas you're talking in a funny way
right
you're using your funny voice „ are you
hm
do you know what I can see
in this
it's a jigsaw
well apart from traffic lights
teeth marks
you must've been chewing on this
when you were a baby you
even so I don't think it was when you were a baby
cause we didn't have this when you were
no
that's the halloween one
no
cause you keep on saluting
you keep putting blue tack on the carpet
and it gets trodden in and it makes a real mess
no
not with your
ssh
I'm not recording when you're making a lot of noise like that
nobody wants to listen to that
no
they don't
just think you're really silly
right
is this the road then
what have you got in it
a car
a van
another car
police car
taxi
people carrier
limousine
minibus
and a fire engine
and a bus
oh post van
number two
do you think that looks like a post van
it's a red van „ isn't it
which is your favorite
the police car
the fire engine's number
nine and four
good boy
pardon
three quarters
a three and a four did you know that was three quarters
have you learned that Thomas
a three at the top with a line and a four at the bottom is three quarters
ah that's very clever
and do you know what a half is
two minutes off one

do you know what a half looks like if you were writing a half down
you can do
well it's nice as it is for a change
but if it runs better with the proper cab on then I'd pop the old cab on
yes
would it
do you know what that Tesco tanker says
Tesco why pay more
why pay more
and there's a question mark at the end of the word more
cause it's asking a question
why pay more
more jig
what do you mean
more jig
silly jig you
watch Thomas
watch this
I was asking you before
do you know how a half's written down
a one
a line
and what's under the line

a number two
well actually we can have an apple at lunch and you can cut it up
mhm
if you're very careful
no I'm not
I haven't
the duck's behind me
right
that's an apple
that's cutting it in half
ah you're drawing a nice leaf on top
that's nice
apples
mhm

and strawberry donuts
one century
I've never had lemon donuts
oh right
is that new for the millenium

can you say millenium yet
good boy
are there
right
you said there were apple donuts
blueberry
blueberry pie yum yum
do you remember that book
orange donuts
not had those either
Men in Black donuts
right
that's a half
if I cut into four it's cut into quarters
that's a quarter
yes
just a minute
right
then if we have that one
three of those that's called
three
go to
you can do whatever you like darling
just show me which ones
you always scribble
which one's the quarter
shh
which one's a quarter
which one says a quarter Thomas
no
no
one quarter
no
yes
which one's a half
and which one's three quarters
that's right
so it's just the one quarter you got muddled up with
wasn't it
that's beautiful
are you going to rub that out and draw me something else
this is the Megasketcher „ isn't it
you've just erased the picture
that's what the noise was
well
yes
a bit
a bit oval
I think it's alright
it depends whose face it is
it could be a really big smily face
you'd get a huge wide smile on that „ wouldn't you
do you
well have a look at
oh right
okay
well you draw that
oh well my hair probably is messy so
nothing wrong there
will you have a look at this jigsaw Thomas
and all the people that are on the jigsaw
and they've all got different sorts of hair
a lot have got hats
look at the people on the bus
at the top we've got that elderly lady knitting with a hat on
oh I don't sit and knit
Mary
and then we've got
a lady with
yeah
then we've got the lady with the headscarf
that looks like the queen
cause the queen often wears a headscarf
and look at that man
oh he's got a bobble hat
what's he doing
do you think he's going achoo
I know what it
z it's a
I can't say it
I was just about to say is he asleep
I was trying to say
is he asleep and is he snoring
and I went
is z
so
and what sort of hats are the people on the fire engine wearing
right
and what about the people carrier
I think the people carrier's got people that are either going to a football match or going camping
no
not the seaside
do you reckon
going to where
going silly
were you thinking of skiing
no
going to the north pole
well certainly they're dressed for winter
they've all got woolly hats on and they look like they've got coats
what about the limousine
ah there's one person with a hat in the limousine
number seven
are you too busy drawing now
well that's the chauffeur of the car
he's got a cap
the people carrier
number six
I can't see any hats
number five
the taxi driver's wearing a cap
number four it's police people
so what are they wearing
that's right
number three is a car
looks like a Mummy driving her children to school
they've no hats
number two is a red van
which could be a person
it looks beautiful
you look like you've got a banana for your mouth it's such a big smile
oh is it
oh I thought you said that it looked like you
number two is a red van
and you said it looked like a post van and it's quite true
bom bom bom
Postman pat
PostmanPat
PostmanPat
PostmanPat
hey
that's a
both of those men have hats or caps on
and number one's a man on his own in a car
he's no hat
and the traffic lights haven't got hats „ have they
pardon
that would be silly „ wouldn't it
the thing is though the lights are in a cover „ aren't they
so the traffic lights are sort of a cover for the bulbs
that's a nice picture Thomas
big ears
have I got very short legs
it's a nice picture
I like that
my nose seems to be right between my eyes that's the only thing

oh glasses yes
Thomas
I don't have a snotty nose
I don't
not at the moment
well I'm not a big old lady so that's alright
not yet anyway
oh yes
it doesn't really look like me now though
my hair just seems to be stuck on top on that picture Thomas
well not now I've just brushed it thank you very much
have I

you can do
nice family picture
yes you can do
shall I start doing that fire engine
I meant this
this
fire engine jigsaw
do you like it
oh
two firemen in that one
this is a huge one
if you carry on with the kitchen we'll do this in a minute
I'm cold now I've changed seats
it was warm sitting there
well not really Thomas
well that's alright as long as
four legs
that's right yes
this is
I was just about to say it looks like a head with four legs

and messy hair
Billy the octopus
ah that's
oh that looks more like a pussy cat now
don't forget the big fluffy tail
ah that's lovely
P
O
what do you think s next
no
R
then it's
no
you said it a few minutes ago
D
you're right
you're it's D
let's see if we can find a picture of a D if we can Thomas
D
D yes
that's it
remember
b the babby in here
and
yep
what are you
that only says Purdie
are you going to make an E
Purdie
I
i
Purdie
oh just Purdie
right
Mum and Purdie
you've a small face
but I think you're a little bit larger than Purdie actually
aren't you
pardon
it actually looks a little bit like a skeleton Thomas
yes
it's very good though
it looks like a ghost
do you remember halloween parties those masks
listen is that what it looks like
I think you've put Mun instead of Mum
you've put m u n
it's m u m
Mum and Purdie
and skeleton which is you
Mum is an idiot again
oh no that's not nice
don't put that
three eyed Thomas yes
do you think when you're drawing you're putting the nose a little bit high up
a sweetie with sticking up hair
well you're
you're a little sweetie „ aren't you
my little sweetie
no
you can't
no
I'm not giving you a sweetie Thomas
I'm just there's a lot of noise at Liam's house
they're doing something with those
well no it's not
they're doing something with those trees
you know that they're putting at the front

I don't know what they're
some of them have died
I think they're cutting some of them down
that's always typical
whenever we set this thing going
there's always noise of some sort „ isn't there
and it's
well it sounds like a lawnmower but it isn't it's
you don't usually cut your grass after sort of autumn
it's always full of fallen leaves and you hafta sweep it
but then usually it's about March time when you start cutting the grass again
and then it grows really quickly
especially in the summer when it's very warm
and you hafta do it once sometimes twice a week
but
yeah
yes
well how do you spell Dad
no
I'm just saying
Dad
very good
I think Liam's Daddy planted those trees last summer
hoping
no
Daddy's not big headed
well he's got a larger head than you
but big headed means something else
big headed means not very nice
well that's me
snuggy boots
no
Liam's Daddy got those trees in the summer
thinking that they would grow nice and tall around the side of the house
and then they were going to put a conservatory there
but he wants it a bit private before he builds it
but a lot of them have just died so it looks like they're taking some
some of them down
sorry
well it looks
I'll tell you what it is
you've drawn the most beautiful eye
with gorgeous eyelashes
but you've got beautiful eyes and beautiful eyelashes
and you're not a girl
are you going to kiss her now
so Daddy's only got one
Daddy's only got one eye „ has he
according to your picture
it could be his side view
cause if I stand sideways you can only see this eye „ can't you
eye eye
I'm keeping
I'm keeping an eye on you there Thomas
that's beautiful
now
how come he's only he's got one eye with beautiful eyelashes
and you've drawn the other eye
yes
I think so
no they're ears
well you've just done a d
for for Purdie's name „ haven't you
d and
now
because it's a person's name you could actually have done a capital d
what's a capital d
capital d
would you like me to show you
no
what about a capital p
or a capital m
no
well
it can be fun
well I think that's a beautiful drawing
shall I write on it
our family
or not
what are you
Thomas
you're not being very nice
oh on the picture
yes actually
I've got the biggest head of the lot of you

big head Mummy
big headed Mummy
you're quite right
big headed Mummy
our family
there we are
I think we oughta have that printed
and made into a Christmas card
right
Steve's coming round
so I'll just hafta have a break on the tape
I think he's about to ring the doorbell
oh or bang the knocker
right
I'm going to have a go at that fire engine jigsaw now
well that's fine
I'm just going to sit with you
I seem to think last time we did this though it actually took a lot of room up „ didn't it
do you remember
Thomas what's this off
ah I was just about to ask you what it's off
I know that
I was about to say
what's this off
but has it got something to do with that racing car track
what
no
oh well it's
I found another one
and when I picked it up I knew I'd seen it before
and I couldn't think what it was
but I've remembered now
gosh
that's so noisy „ isn't it
I can't even see where the men are
the truck's out here „ isn't it
I'm just wondering whether we oughta stop for a while
yes love
sounds as if he's on our roof
well they can't be round the back cause Liam's house is over there
look the equipment's on the front
can you see it
if you look out of the window you can see the white van
but I just don't know
I mean there are some trees round the back of their house
but the back of their house shouldn't affect noise here should it
I don't know
right
I'm going to have a little go at this
ow
if we
well I was just thinking
I was just thinking perhaps we needta get this fire engine built quickly
if you've got petrol in that tanker
yes
do you think there's room to do it here or not
do you wanna try and help me find a bit of
fire engine wheels
well shall I do it through there then
well it might be a bit quieter actually if we go through there mightn't it
supervise it
I'm worried more about the noise than the size of the jigsaw
what we going to do with
ah are they stuck at the traffic lights as well
oh never
well which one's beeping
well I would imagine if two petrol tankers had crashed
not lorries
and one's a tanker
the police would hafta come „ wouldn't they
cause what would happen if the petrol spilt all over the road
yeah
I'm not sure
cause a normal police car would have a blue light „ wouldn't it
I don't know darling
how many wheels can you see on this fire engine Thomas
fire engine jigsaw
fire engine jigsaw
I'm just wondering which bit I'm doing now
which part of the jigsaw do you think I'm doing
do you
I can see a wheel
ah it must be the door look
yes
why
which little screws
yes
that hold the wheels on
yeah
has it
just now
has it
do you think the wheel's going to drop off
don't crash any more please
cause this isn't ready yet
this fire engine can't come rushing when it's not built
what on earth is
ah
do you know what it is
I might have a window open upstairs
I'd forgotten that
that's probably why it's so noisy
I couldn't work out why
is it
right
just a minute
is that any better Thomas
just a little bit
has that helped by shutting the window upstairs
oh good
well guess what I've seen while I was shutting the window upstairs
you what
no I didn't see Felix
pardon
hm
don't know
very good the jigsaw

the window cleaners were coming round as well
when I was standing on your bed closing the window
yes please
I saw the window cleaners
and now there's a big white van
no
it's not your white van there then
would you
well if your van suddenly took to the road I would find that quite funny
but that's little man's head isn't it that you're holding
he's got to sit
well shall we find another head as well and see if we can
I thought that was somebody's head
that's very strange you should go for that
right
oh there's the bit of the wheel

he looks like
what's the one in FiremanSam called
yes
Trevor Evans
Thomas
how is that
now we've got to find red bits here
I think that's very good
that's it
wonderful
clever boy
that's great Thomas
that's really good that
neenaa
neenaa
what's that song
that goes there I think
no that way
up there
well it doesn't actually no
well let's look on the picture on the jigsaw box

this is the fire engine video you've got „ isn't it

fire engine
the fire engine
everyone looks
fire engine
the fire engine
the fire engine
everyone looks at the
fire engine
you know the words better than I do

and equipment
something and equipment
clean and bright
what is it
clean
breathing apparatus
what is it
breathing apparatus


fire engine
the fire engine
everyone look at the pearly engine
the Purdie engine
the Purdie engine
everyone looks at
oh well done
Purdie engine
it would
yes it would
do you know what the Purdie engine would be really good at
getting cats down from trees
meow meow meow meow
if anybody's listening to us they won't know what we're talking about
but you've got a fire engine video and it's full of songs „ isn't it
oh that was very nearly
I thought that was going to be
no
it's a piece like that that you need „ isn't it
same sort of colors
actually do you remember the Tweenies
how four
a song
yes
well guess what
when I was at work
the other day
in fact I might have it upstairs
I'll go and have a look
there was a book
and it had
I found the piece
it had the words to that song in
and I copied it
no
it's very near
this is the thing with jigsaws
they all look
the same
but there's only one that actually fits „ isn't there
oh very good Thomas

very good
do you think that fits down there
and did you see
was it right
jolly good
great
well I'm just looking for the words to that song
right
here it is
it's five little firemen
I can't remember the tune
but it's
five little firemen standing in a row
one two three four five they go
hop on the engine with a shout
quicker than a wink and the fire is out
that's the tune
good
five little firemen standing in a row
one two three four
five they go
hop on the engine with a shout
quicker than a wink and the fire is out
well we'll sing the two firemen verse then
two little firemen standing in a row
one two woosh they go
hop on the engine with a shout
quicker than a wink the fire is out
quicker than a wink
and at the end it's
no little firemen standing in a row
woosh they go
I love you as well
I do
you're a noisy boy and you thought no one loved you
aw
poor little noisy boy
he thought no one loved him
now
you don't say that
don't be silly
look
I am very happy
cause I've just put a piece in there
I seem to think that this jigsaw has one piece more than it needs as well
do you remember the last time we did it
we had two pieces the same
so I bet one poor little boy or girl's got a jigsaw at home with pieces missing
do you think

look at this
that must be
that must be very important for you I think that piece

now I think that must belong somewhere up there as well
well just move it down a bit
it's a road
it'll move along „ won't it
now on the picture look
cause look Mum
oh yes
ah and look what I've done
we have „ haven't we
what
now
we're making the road
now look at the top of the picture
it says fire and rescue
and there's the f i
so I think these words will go around here somewhere „ don't you
yes
right
I think that's it there actually Thomas
there
up here somewhere
so now we've got to fit the rest of the words
we've got fire and rescue
fire and
oh that's the bit that's the same look
somebody's jigsaw might not say fire and rescue like ours does

fire and
hm
do you think they do other jigsaws like this Thomas
diggers or do they do buses
we saw one in a shop „ didn't we
a while ago
do you not remember
that's a bit near you I think
am I
oh well done
well done
and there's a bit look
ah these bits both look like they belong to you somewhere
because they've got a little bit of light blue on them
oh Thomas you're getting good at this
we've nearly finished this
that's it
that's it
exactly right
well done
I think that
I don't think you're getting very fat it's just this is a
it says on the box it's a giant fire engine floor puzzle
I think that goes there actually
what do you think
then
and what about that there
no
it doesn't „ does it
shall we try
is there
ah but there
let's see is there another little bit of light blue
there is „ isn't there
if I put that there
I think your bit will fit on
are you
right
three bits to fit in
no
because I've done one
and you've done two
and there's three
the last piece
hm you've done very well with that Thomas
look at that
can you do what sorry
roll over it
yes
it's stuck a little bit „ hasn't it
roll over it like a steam roller flattening it out
so that says
fire and rescue
so now if anything happens to the Tesco tanker
or Tesco lorry
then we can go
neenaa to put the fire out

no
I only sang a little bit of it
ooh that man's got a big
ooh I say
come and look at this machine this man's got there
it's like a blower „ isn't it
Thomas you've knocked the book off
it's a leaf blower that „ isn't it
no
I don't think I'd want my skirt blown up
thank you very much indeed
no
especially not where lotsof men are
I like his
Thomas
I like that gardener's van actually
look the side flips down and he's got all his dustbins and things
do you think that's where he's going to put all pieces of sawed off wood
do you know what sawed off tree's called when it's chopped up the bits that
well bark
bark's round the outside of a trunk
but if a branch is cut up into little pieces
you and Nanna have one that you carry around
