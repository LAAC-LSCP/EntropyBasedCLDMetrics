Dimitra running
your hair's all stuck up at the back
look at this
I brushed your hair this morning
that's your third bowl of Cornflakes this morning
yes
Thomas eat
the Beehive
did you say Quaver
well you went to the Beehive last week and somebody gave you some Quavers „ didn't they
is that what you're trying to say
normally at the playgroup you get a slice of toast and a drink of blackcurrant juice
and yesterday you got Cornflakes and a biscuit „ didn't you
instead
good
oh yes
you can
pop
no blue juice
what do you mean by blue juice
you shut the cupboard
you've got to finish your breakfast yet
I've just out some toast in the toaster
blackcurrant
blackcurrant and biscuits
you sat with Rachel yesterday and ate a lot of Cornflakes „ didn't you
you all sit down together
all the children sit round a table at eleven o'clock which is nice „ isn't it
butter
yes
I'm getting the butter out of the fridge
you've eaten a third bowl of Cornflakes
has the postman been this morning Thomas
has he
I haven't seen him
he doesn't come everyday „ does he
the Cornflakes are done
that juice is sounding as if it as got air in it again
squeaky juice
the quack quack
oh the quack quack on it
oh do you think the lip of your beaker looks like a beak on a duck
is that what you're saying
a quack quack on it
an ambulance do it
where's the ambulance
you saw an ambulance the other day „ didn't you
no
I think Peggy had had a fall „ hadn't she
and they carried her into the back of the ambulance „ didn't they
the Doctor's going to make her better
is the Doctor going to make Peggy better
Peggy had a son called Thomas „ didn't she
what's your name
oh dear
it as started to rain outside
I thought it was going to be a nice day
no
she doesn't „ does she
and what did we watch the other day
at least you saw it with Grandma and Granddad
what happened in the sky
the moon and the sun
it was the Eclipse „ wasn't it
yes
you watched
you watched it on television „ didn't you
a bite out of the moon
yes
when they were first showing a picture of the sun when the moon was just crossing it it looked as if somebody had had a bite out of a biscuit „ didn't it
two Smarties one
it looked like two Smarties the sun and the moon „ didn't it
and the moon went over the sun it went dark
it didn't really go dark in Manchester „ did it
and then suddenly the sun shone again
yes
a train do it
you're going off at a tangent now
you're talking about going to the train station afterwards
no
before the Eclipse you went to watch the trains „ didn't you
and that's the noise that the train made when it was setting off
so if I were you Dimitra
I'd be very careful when you're traveling BritishRail
I'll see if Purdie wants to come in because it's raining
do you wanna come in Puss
no
I don't think she does „ does she
no
she's quite happy outside

the butter's here
it's not in the fridge
it's on the worktop
pardon
the butter
yes
a lot of it isn't butter though Thomas
Mummy uses old butter dishes as storage containers
which is a bit annoying because you go to put butter on your bread and you get pasta from the night before or something like that
are you not going to finish your toast

I'm sure you'll have some grapes if I wash them „ won't you
bite crunch
no
