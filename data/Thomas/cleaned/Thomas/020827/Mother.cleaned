looking for the little sound
but if

there's a candle
and that's the new year candle „ isn't it
what does it say on it
happy Christmas
it says nineteen ninety nine millennium two thousand

because I'll needta drop the stereo
quickly

is that all there is
good boy
thank you
that's clever „ wasn't it
helping Mummy
do you think the other tape's still in Daddy's car
yes
the paper can go back in that one
it's just the tapes you mustn't touch
because if you start touching the tapes they're not going to work

because at the moment it's standing on a plate
and it's not very stable „ is it
let's see what we've got in this box „ shall we
let's have a look in this box and see if it as got a nice tray

rearrange it
I don't know where we've gone wrong
but we've gone wrong somewhere haven't we

I think we can probably put that one on top before we put the lid and box back
there we are
it's full
it is full now
yes
all tidied away
let's take it back to the cupboard now
would you like to carry this plate

come and put it on the worktop in the kitchen please
that's a good boy
thank you
that's lovely „ isn't it

you're pulling them
it's like a big chain that a foreman might use „ isn't it
if he was pulling something along
hold like you
how about saying Mummy please would you hold the rope
I will certainly help hold the rope Thomas
thank you
you're going to hold the other end „ are you
a very long chain „ haven't we
you're putting it under the tractor
under you bicycle
you want me to hold the rope
you're being terribly bossy Thomas „ aren't you
very bossy
mister bossy boots
we'll hafta start calling you
won't we
mister bossy boots
I'm surprised that paper chain survived
because you've been playing with it an awful lot „ haven't you
are we going to have a look at this spaceship Thomas
not yet
oh I'm sorry
I'm pulling the rope first „ am I
it's like a big skipping rope „ isn't it
all these little pieces of paper
all these loops are links in the chain
lotsof links make one big chain
oh no
you needn't lick it darling
we've made it now „ haven't we
how many different colors can you see
yellow red and pink
that's three colors
oh what's that noise
a lady reversing her car
it sounded very noisy „ didn't it
it's the lady next to Peggy's house
she'll be driving off in a moment
driving off
she as driven off now
a white car
a white car
are you going to sneeze
oh you looked you were
no nothing's wrong
my slipper's sliding off again
oh you'll hafta help me
oh Thomas
you're hitting my foot
be careful
you banged the slipper down and knocked my leg
how's that
you haven't got your slippers on this morning „ have you
I think we ad better keep this piece of paper Thomas
otherwise we're not going to know how to make things „ are we
are you
building
right
well look here's the spaceship
that's the body
it as got wheels
it's lovely „ isn't it
it really is nice
well the wheels are underneath
I think they're fixed on
shall we make this appear
right
we need some of the red ones now
looks to me as if the red ones go on like that
you need a rope
you need a rope to pull it
well they've got red bits there Thomas
but I can't see any red bits „ can you
what do you think those are
we haven't any red bits like that „ have we
we've put all those red bits on
ah I know why we haven't got red bits
it came with some stickers „ didn't it
so we could put the stickers on later
what do we need at the front
where's the big blue thing
ah there it is
and is the little man going to sit in the front do you think
but that's obviously why
because they've put the stickers on theirs „ haven't they
we haven't done that with ours yet
that doesn't seem to wanna go on that Thomas
Mummy doesn't know why
is there something else that needs to go on instead
how about that
is it silly
is it silly or is Mummy silly
oh yes
we'll put that on as well
did Granddad and Daddy help you build this on ChristmasDay
I think we perhaps need two pieces on that
to make it level
how about the little spaceman
shall we sit him inside
there
is that his little slot
now
where as Mummy gone
Mummy's here
you're a sweet boy Tom „ aren't you
oh right
oh without that Thomas I can't see what I'm sposta be doing sweetheart
you see that man seems to be a lot lower down „ doesn't he
but I think it's confusing Mummy because we haven't got a lot of these
it's lower down
and we haven't got a lot of the pieces that this man seems to have on his
perhaps if we put
a few bricks there Thomas
hello
how are you
you're two and a half „ are you
oh
that's an age
it's nice being two and a half „ isn't it
are we some bricks short Thomas
do you think
and look he seems to have that little space alien coming out of the side there
how's that
we've not used that though „ have we
we needta put that on something
it's a little aerial
he as built all sorts „ hasn't he
on his
are you a tired boy
what's that you're playing with Thomas
was that another Christmas present
who was that from
Isabelle
I think it was Grandma and Granddad „ wasn't it
it's from who
who's choo choos
it's playing the teddy bear's picnic now „ isn't it
is that nice
are you playing with your elephant now
is that OldMacDonald
shall we play with that another time Thomas
look
I've finished doing this now for you
look
this is like the picture on the box „ isn't it
look
that's a spaceship
and that's a little
no
that's a space station
right
look it runs along the floor
oh
wondered what that was
it's the little Simba the lion „ isn't it
yes
the elephant can go on board the spaceship „ can't he
do you think the elephant would fit inside the spaceship
shall we take the lid off and see
oh no I don't think he will actually sweetheart
because it doesn't go through „ does it
shall we sit him in it and he can have a little ride like that
look at that
wow
isn't that lovely
do you think PostmanPat would fit in as well
there we are
PostmanPat's there
hello
what about the fireman from your fire station
the fire engine
the fireman will go „ won't he
so now you've got the spaceman
you've got PostmanPat the elephant the fireman and the space alien
little spaceman doesn't seem to be sitting in the right place „ does he
that's it
everybody's driving off
yes
you're trying to get in as well
oh you're getting in the fire engine „ are you
this is lovely „ isn't it
everybody's driving off
do you remember that story about Pippo the monkey and Tom wanted to go to the moon „ didn't they
they hadta go in the rocket
do you think they'd be going in something like this
are you tired sweetheart
oh
what's that
an empty video box

oh dear

it's just a little space station
it seems to have fallen over
not to worry

the fireman station
oh is it the
oh now that's something we wanted to do
when we were staying over in York Mummy wanted to take you to see the fire station
because in Poppington you can see the fire engines
but it was so wet
the first day we went for a walk round the town it was lovely „ wasn't it
but then last night it was awful
it was raining and it wasn't at all nice
there we are
that's a bit more stable „ isn't it
fireplace
it could be the fire station „ couldn't it
because when the siren goes at the fire station all the men hafta come down the pole
and this could be the pole „ couldn't it
when Mummy was a little girl Grandma useta take her to that fire station
oh we saw the fire station in York though „ didn't we
tower

rush
they'd hafta rush if the chip shop was on fire „ wouldn't they
can you imagine all those chips going up in smoke Thomas
you've been a very good boy tidying up „ aren't you
I'm very impressed with you Thomas
because every time you play with your train set you put it back in the box
and I think that's very clever
mind you FatherChristmas did say that „ didn't he
I'll bring you all these toys Thomas
but you've got to tidy up afterwards
so you're really being a very clever boy because you're doing as you're told
you're hiding from Mummy
ah poor Mummy
is that because I mentioned tidying up
what are you doing in the kitchen Thomas
you're not Thomas you're a fireman
oh fireman what are you doing in the kitchen
oh I see
you've been to get the lock off the fridge to put round your neck so it looks like a snorkel
I see
you've got your yellow helmet on now
I think you're very tired actually
you're quietening „ aren't you
the long journey in the car
we'll put this box away now
that's another present „ isn't it
