it's a dumpingdown
what's a dumpingdown
Mummy bought it and I can't think why now
we went to Charlotte's
we went to Charlotte's party „ didn't we
and I think this was a present „ wasn't it
in something like PasstheParcel
and Isabel won the prize
and you liked it so much that Mummy bought you one
but I can't think why I bought it
I think it was because you'd been very good sometime
but it's actually broken a bit now „ hasn't it
we need a new one
you want Isabel's
oh I'm sure Isabel's is broken by now as well
I'll just try and undo it a bit
it's one of these
there's a name for it
I can't think what it is
this is a multicolored sort of coil „ isn't it
a plastic coil
when I was little they useta be made of metal
and we useta put them on the stairs and they would walk down on their own
but this one never worked like that
I tell you what
we've got to go into Didsbury later on today
how about we go back to the shop where I bought this and see if they've got some more
would you like that
we'll see if we can get another one
because we had quite a lot of fun with this
you thought it was a fire
oh look at that
I've got that right at that side
hose pipe
oh look
if I've mended that side I can perhaps mend this one
shall I just have a try
you have this side
you be careful
that's right
I'll try and do it
that would be really good if I can get it sorted out
you played with Dimitra with this
do you remember
farty pants has been in your bottom
does that mean you needta use your potty
it better not be too late
it won't be
do you needta use your potty now
it isn't
well it's alright making a noise „ isn't it
but it's if you needta do anything else you need your potty
is there a fire in the kitchen
you're just pretending
well it's taking me awhile to get it untwisted „ isn't it
yes
that seems to be the problem now
once before though we thought it was broken Daddy managed to get it untwisted „ didn't he
and I thought I could do it but
I can do that side
I think we will get it sorted though
it's springy „ isn't it
what sort of colors can you see Thomas
lotsof colors
are you going to tell me what colors you can see
no
I think the other thing we oughta get for you
it was something Dimitra useta bring
I'll hafta ask Jeannine to bring it
do you remember those foam pipes
yellow
that were yellow and pink
those bendy foam pipes
do you remember the the ones I mean
you don't
I'm trying to untwist it
I think we'll get it sorted
because the other end is perfect now „ isn't it
we're very nearly there
where
oh right
do we
right
I'll turn the water on

turn it on at the tap
is that alright
do you
I don't know love
last night there was a watering can in your fire engine
I don't know where it is
do you
well we're getting very twisted with this but think this end is not quite as easy to do as the other end „ is it
right
there we are
oh dear
what as happened to this
it's in an almighty muddle „ isn't it


do you know what they actually use to put a fire out
foam
foam
it's like lots and lotsof squirty bubbles
well we haven't got any
the only foam we've got is when we've got lotsof bubbles
and sometimes firemen use powder
you know like your talcum powder
well it's a fire on something electrical
say your television caught fire
you couldn't start pouring water onto the television because you can't put water on the television
you hafta use something else to dampen out the flames
you could use powder
some of the extinguishers that you see have powder in them
and fire blankets
that's another thing you can use to put fire's out with
what sort fires do you use fire blankets to put the flames out with
chips
chip pan fire
that's right
you use water foam powder fire blankets
all sorts of things
I've got the end sorted and we've ended up with the middle twisted
how's that
oh dear
this is going to take forever „ isn't it
forever and ever and a day
no
the bit I've sorted out's fine
is it not fixed
well just a minute
well don't pull it
well we've got this end sorted out
look
just a minute Tom
please
wait a minute
you look more like a clown
a butterfly
you're a butterfly flapping „ are you
a butterfly flapping
oh you sillybilly
it's all twisted up
there

I think we've seen the end of this „ don't you
oh there
it's just this little bit here
if we could get this sorted
which way do you think it needs to go
just this bit here
can you help me
no
don't go round anymore
you'll get stuck „ won't you
are you
oh you're silly
what a sillybilly
no
stand still
I can't do it now Thomas
it looks like a fancy belt
you look like something out of Space
don't you
oh careful

careful
don't pull it Thomas
no
no
just let's tighten it up a bit
no
I don't think we will buy a new one because it's only going to get the same „ isn't it
what do you say
you say yes please or please may I have
you told me yesterday that you read a story at nursery about saying
thank you
are you going to tell me about that story
you came out of nursery and you said Mummy if somebody gives you something you should say thank you
I've been saying that to you for a long time „ haven't I
if you want something you say please
if you're given something you say thank you
if you don't want something you say
no thanks
that's right
so tell me about the
tell me about the story please
no
Thomas are you going to tell me about the story
why
because you don't love me

you look very funny because you look like you've got a spring coil coming from your back and your bottom
you look like you've got a swinging tail
isn't that funny
what sort of animal are you
a kangaroo
you could be a kangaroo bouncing with that „ couldn't you
bouncy

kangaroos jump „ don't they
that's right
like that
have you seen some kangaroos somewhere
Thomas have you see some kangaroos
that's silly
I didn't say it was your bottom
I said it looked like you had a tail
who has a tail
you're stuck
oh dear
you've got it into a real mess again
no pushing
excuse me
what do you say
Thomas
no
that's Mummy's important piece of paper
can you pop it on the stairs for me please
would you like to get one of the books and we'll read it
would you like to pass one of your books and we'll read it
that one
right
come and sit next to me then
this is called SmallBear lost
SmallBear
oh look at him
tears
he's sitting on a train crying „ isn't he
can you see him sitting on the bus
where is he
right at the back „ isn't he
what's our park called
DidsburyPark
yes
look
he's going up and up and up with the birds „ isn't he
look at him
he is more like a bird „ isn't he
how many balloons are pulling SmallBear
two
I think there are three
I can see a yellow a red and blue one
can you
well he was going to look like an aeroplane but the balloons have burst now
and he as fallen down bump
I bet he has
look
he's crying again
more tears
just like when we found him on the train all alone
he has hurt his bottom
look how red his bottom is
and there's all little marks
oh poor bear
well he wasn't
yes
the balloons burst and he fell down
oh what's that
oh it's a skip lorry
that'll be going to Sue's house „ won't it
he's going back back back
but I think he'll be going to Sue's house in a minute „ don't you
yes
it does look like a crane
he is rubbing his bottom because it's sore
why
he needs to cheer his bottom up „ does he
it as gone dark now
look
and he's still waiting
now while SmallBear's waiting why don't you go to the window and see what's happening
yes
you go to the window and tell me what's happening
because SmallBear's waiting for someone to come and help him cross the road
has he
he hasn't „ has he
I don't know
it is „ isn't it
well perhaps it's nothing to do with Sue's house
perhaps it's picking the skip up from the road
I would imagine that he'd left the skip on the road and he drove up there so that he could turn round
and now he's backed up
and in a minute I think he'll lift the yellow skip or whatever color the skip is
the red one
onto the back of his lorry and I think he'll take it to Sue's house
it might be a blue one
yes
well I thought it might be yellow or red and you're saying blue
that's the color of the balloons in the teddy bear story that we've just read „ isn't it
we'll hafta guess
oh it's lifting up now
can you see
it's a yellow one
it's not
is it pulling it
lifting it up
it is a yellow one „ isn't it
look at that
you like blue skips
I saw a blue skip the other day when I was waiting for Daddy to come and pick me up
I wonder where you were
oh I think you were with me
the other day when we went to Didsbury and we were waiting for Daddy to pick us up we saw a blue skip
it was a blue skip with a white face on it
and you said
oh I can't remember now
MisterSkippy or something
this lorry says QuickSkip
look
he's going reverse into Sue's house I think
you know when we went
we went last night we saw them digging all that earth up „ didn't we
oh look
there's Mo
can you see Mo
Sue's husband
Mo
that man in the blue tshirt with his arms folded
that's Leonard but we call him Mo „ don't we
look
they're lowering the skip down
you want
well I tell you what this is going to be jolly exciting because that skip will be there now for a few days
and you'll be able to watch people loading things into it
I think it'll be mainly clay because they're digging out all the clay from the back garden „ aren't they
yes
when we had our land drain done do you remember we had a skip outside in the garden for a long time
but we demolished the old garden shed as well
yes
he's climbing up again „ isn't he
well he's going to secure the chains I think
can you see the lifting equipment's moving up „ isn't it
is he having a ride on the back
now he's going to jump in his cab in a minute
he's saying goodbye
bye bye Mo
bye bye skip man
yes
we knocked down our old garden shed and built a new one when we had a skip outside
and all the old pieces of wood from the shed we put on top of the skip for the skip man to take away and then Sue and Andy
do you remember Sue and Andy who useta live next door
Sue came round and said can I please take all the wood from your skip
because she wanted to build something for the dogs „ didn't she
there you are
you can wave to the skip man
look
he as got orange neenas on his lorry
we can't really see the skip man for Stephen's car
if Stephen moves his car we'll be able to see it „ won't we
I don't know
they're shouting „ aren't they
I think perhaps he's having a job to get past
sounds like he's going
oh I see
they must have met a car
ohgosh a car with a trailer
but the trailer
the man with the trailer on his car is the man doing the work „ isn't he
so look
he's parking up now
no
he hasn't left him
the skip as driven off now
but this man
oh look
the skip man's driving past again
that's the builder
the man that's now there with Mo
he's the man that's going to be digging all that clay and putting it in the skip
and then in a day or so when the skip s really full we'll probably see that lorry coming back again to take the skip away
a new skip
well it depends on how much rubbish he as got
it's not really rubbish „ is it
it's soil that he's taking away
at Susan's house
yes
there
excitement over
shall we finish this story
shall we see if anybody as come to help the bear across the road
look
teddy's waiting
because you know Thomas
this is what happens
if you found yourself at one side of the road and you wanted to be at the other you'd just wait and wait „ wouldn't you
never try and cross a road on your own
what would happen
no
whether cars are coming or not you just wait for somebody to help you cross safely
look
when the teddy bear
even though he has a sore bottom and he was sad he waited
and look
it's sunshining in the picture
in this picture the stars are out
it's dark
but he's still waiting
rather than cross the road on his own and getting knocked down he's waiting
ah and then
the little girl and her mother who were obviously taking the dog for a walk
look
found the small girl asleep by the gates
look
she's cuddling him
yes
the pussy cat's on the wall watching it all
oh look
the Mummy's walking the dog and holding the little girl's hand
and the little girl's cuddling teddy
isn't that nice
what about what
we needta build that „ do we
right
shall we
do you wanna be a skip lorry
okay
it is a Tesco wagon „ isn't it
it's the one Daddy got last night
I think Rachel's here now with baby Miles
look
oh look who it is
it's Rachel and her Daddy
oh look
a wheelbarrow's going to the skip Thomas
the man's tipping the first load of earth from the wheelbarrow into the skip
and there's baby Miles
look
look at baby Miles asleep in his little chair
his little rock a tot
can you see him
ah
would I like a skip today
yes please
I've got to sort a lot of things out in the house
we might have a lot of rubbish
that's right
that's right
you start picking things up and putting them into the skip
the man over the road's bringing the wheelbarrow loads of earth to the skip
just a minute Thomas
I think Rachel's coming to the door now
what's happening with the skip outside
I think they've put quite a few things in it „ don't you
can you see
he as got a digger there now „ has he
a Scoop
well he as got a wheelbarrow
has he got a digger there
I can't see the digger
can you
are you sure that's not just the skip
pardon
don't climb any higher Thomas
into that window please
you'll fall
get down
a Scoop
you're talking about BobtheBuilder now „ aren't you
yes
that's a skip Thomas
that's a skip not a skip lorry
but it's the container „ isn't it
look
he's tipping the wheelbarrow
can you see
he's tipping wheelbarrow loads of earth
I don't think so
it's just a skip and he's tipping earth from his wheelbarrow into the skip
I'll just turn the iron on because I wanna press these shirts
are you
a T N T lorry
are you
gosh
is he reversing without holding on to his steering wheel

can you hear this noise
it's the noise of the steam iron
I'm just pressing your shirt and shorts
did he
ohgosh that's a big jump Thomas „ isn't it
he jumped off the back of his lorry
oh he's riding on the back „ is he
and
did he
the lorry driver thought it was a funny joke
are you the lorry driver
that's alright then
oh Thomas be careful
you're not hurt „ are you
you're not
did you
oh dear
like the teddy bear in that story
how did the teddy bear hurt his bottom
he fell like that
why did he fall
no
but why did he fall
why did the teddy bear fall
well the balloons popped „ didn't they
on the fence
and when the balloons popped they weren't floating anymore and he came down to earth with a bump „ didn't he
bang crash wallop
is that what they said
oh yes please
I think Daddy thinks we need a skip for the spare room „ doesn't he
well the spare room
don't touch that
the iron's on
the spare bedroom upstairs is a bit of a mess „ isn't it
yes please
that'll be a lovely skip
thank you
Mum this is a big jump
gosh that is a big jump
be careful „ won't you
look at that
have you secured it with chains
do you remember the man this morning
he put big chains round the skip „ didn't he
when he was higheringv it and lowering it
what as he left
he as hung a skip on the gate
for goodness sake
I hope it's a strong gate
I hope it's a strong gate Thomas
it would hafta be fairly strong for a skip to hang on it „ wouldn't it

he's giving Mummy a clue
what sort of clue
why's he giving Mummy a clue
that's the clue „ is it
that he's tipping
and he shouts tip
shh
that's not very quiet „ is it
he's tipping the skip lorry
has he
why has he got two mints in his pocket
is he

do you remember
is it a strong mint
well you better only have the one „ hadn't you
some fire engine bits
oh I don't think that's a fire engine
I think that's part of the train set „ isn't it
no
it's a bit of the train you have
the one that goes forwards and backwards and makes a noise
I think that's the red one
oh it is a fire engine
well done
it's from the train set though „ isn't it
a little ThomasTheTankEngine fire engine
how come we've got a fire engine when we're playing with skips
why as the fire engine hadta come
there's a rescue emergency
why what as happened
has the skip dropped on something
oh dear
that doesn't sound good
goodness me
I hope nobody's hurt
I hope nobody was hurt when the skip fell on the front of the lorry
does he
it would be an emergency „ wouldn't it
if
shh don't shout
oh just a minute now FiremanSam
we're just waiting for Daddy to ring back now
that was Daddy on the phone but he wanted some information
Mummy looked it up
he'll ring back in a minute
pardon
yes
when Daddy rings back we've got to read the numbers out to him „ haven't we
I shall finish this ironing while we're waiting
once we've spoken to Daddy I'm going to start doing lunch
and while the lunch is cooking and cooling you can have a look at the stickers if you like
would you like that
yes
but I can't go upstairs just yet to get the stick because if Daddy rings I needta be near the phone „ don't I
hasn't he
how do you get into your cab then
do you just hafta jump up

I don't think we've actually been on a motorway yet Thomas „ have we

gosh you would remember seeing that

it's brilliant

you mustn't touch any wires
did you
was it a toy fire engine or a real fire engine
a Tommyfireengine

I don't think we can ever go into a shop and buy a real fire engine „ do you
I thought about something
yes
what have you thought about
you thought about buying a lolly
an ice lolly
oh I see
you went into a shop and you thought it sold lollies but you looked round again and it didn't
right
right
oh when we went to the butcher shop last night
do you remember
we bought some bacon and a packet of frozen peas
when I opened the freezer for the frozen peas I noticed he had some lolly pops
Michael
well they weren't really lolly pops they were more like those ice pop things
you know in the plastic tubes
we can make stickers now „ can we
well would you like to run upstairs and get them
you know where they are „ don't you
oh right

look
oops

I've just trod on my own foot

does it
gosh shall I put it next to the other one
it's a very small ladybird
perhaps it wants to be with the Mummy ladybird there
look
there we are
yes
that looks more like a dragonfly to me than a butterfly
that's a butterfly there
look
the butterfly's the one with the the very pretty wings
yes
that's the dragonfly

it's going sideways now „ isn't it
you can if you try
that's it
look

there
a butterfly on a flower
and on this one there's a bee on the flower
no
I haven't
Thomas I haven't
you're getting crabby when it's stuck down
you're getting crabby when I help you so I don't know what to do
Purdie can do it
you're not bored already „ are you
well that's silly
well shall we
well I tell you what
shall I start cooking lunch
and you can play with it while I'm doing that
no
but Tom

well no
what I'm saying is if I start cooking lunch once it's cooking I can come and play with you
well just a minute
just let me turn the oven on and then I will
yes
are you
what happened to all the stickers
there's one
you've left one on „ have you
no
they're not broken
you've just got to be careful with them
if you get them folded up then they don't stick back on the door „ do they
there we are
let's put them back on here
no
but Thomas
if you leave them screwed up they're not going to stick again „ are they
no
leave them on
what are you going to do with them
yes
but unless you put them back on the board carefully they're not going to work „ are they
they're very
is it
can't they get in because it's too full
oh dear
oh the door's broken
never mind
I'll fix it for you
what happened
did it just fall off
you crashed „ did you
oh dear
no
that's the other one
that's the one that was working
the other one's still lying there
look
are you going to sit in your chair now
sit on the table
let me have a look
there we are
right
you hold it steady
that's a good boy
look at that
how's that
ah do you know why these doors are not closing
because one of them is on the wrong way round
right
are you going to sit in the chair now and have your lunch
right
in your chair
ooh that's a big boy
well let's move your chair up at the table
how's that
there you are
it's still quite hot
the beans aren't hot but the chips are
and I've put some cheese there as well for you
will you eat it quickly now because we're going out Thomas
what do you mean you won't see anything
you don't love me
oh that's a shame
never mind
I think Purdie loves me „ doesn't she
as long as Purdie loves me that's alright
I'm just looking for a bowl
so I can put what I in it
are they cool enough
are they cool
that's right
just check before you eat them
I don't want you burning your mouth
that wouldn't be very good „ would it
ooh do they need blowing
they're alright
would you like some more drink
some more juice
Mummy's just going to have water today
would you like juice or water
juice
what do you say
yes please
that's right
oops a daisy
I just missed the cup when I was putting the water in
oh sugar
yes
that's a good thing to say that „ isn't it
I was just looking at Purdie lying on the grass
can you see her
she's stretched out
you probably can't see from where you're sitting
she's lying right in the middle of the patch of daisys having a little wash
she's washing her legs now
making them nice and clean

well she has paws „ doesn't she
well she as got claws
where we've got fingers and toes Purdie has claws
we have hands and feet and Purdie has paws
we have fingers and toes
Purdie has claws
is that cheese nice
no
is that why you're eating it really quickly
I think it looks quite nice
are you alright
are they cool enough
they're still a bit hot
that's a funny noise
what do you think that is
hm
oh it sounds like a cross between a train and an aeroplane „ doesn't it
the sun as come out now
can you see

well we're going to go out after lunch
but at least it means it'll be nice to go out for a walk „ doesn't it

oh I hope it doesn't start to rain
who's still there
who
the skip

I can only see one skip Tom
a yellow digger
well we'll walk past it in a few minutes and we'll go and have a look

are you enjoying that
Thomas
don't just shake your head
answer me
cheeky boy „ aren't you
oh I don't know what that is
it's not a dustbin lorry and it doesn't look like the road sweeper because he's going a bit too quickly
oh I know what it is
it's the man who comes round and checks the street lamps
it's the same color as the road sweeper but he looks like he has a crane on the side
and I remember now we saw him before
and he goes right to the top of every street lamp and checks that it's working
do you remember watching that on AuntyMabel
how they did it
they go along
and they cover up the sensor „ don't they
with some cloth so that the sensor thinks it's night time and dark
and because it thinks it's dark it turns the light on
so the man testing the lights knows if lights don't come on when he puts the cloth over the sensor that the light isn't working
then he hasta change the bulb „ doesn't he
bulb
the light bulb
that must have been what the funny noise was that we heard
because it's quite a heavy sort of vehicle
there he is
look
he's driving past again
what as he got on
flashing lights

it looks more like a road sweeper to me
but I don't think it is
I imagine that's quite a good thing to play with actually
