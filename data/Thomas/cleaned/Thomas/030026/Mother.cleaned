I don't like belly
I don't know who as taught you to say that
but I don't like it
oh Badger and Bodger

well you watch too much television
I can see the magpie now on the television aerial up there

over where Liam lives
can you see it
it's sposta be one for sorrow
and that magpie as been here all week on it's own „ hasn't it
must be a lonely little bird

mhm
if you smashed through the window and fell in the road we'd hafta sweep you up
wouldn't be nice though Thomas
would it
yes
it's Saturday
I think we might just leave you there actually for Monday
and the bin lorry can do it
you can spend Saturday night outside on the floor in bits and pieces
there's that little girl on her bicycle again
and then you could spend Sunday
lying outside
because I'm not bothering to sweep you up if you're silly enough to fall through the window
I'll leave you there for the dustbin men to pick up on Monday
and then when the bin men come on Monday afternoon they can pick you up and put you straight into the dustbin lorry and take you to the tip
you'd say ohgosh what have I done now
ah you wouldn't be able to say ohgosh what have I done now if you're all in bits „ would you
no
on Sue's road
yes
so you don't wanna do that „ do you
would it be very lonely sleeping outside tonight when it's dark
would you be much better staying inside in the house with Mummy and Daddy
and Purdie
oh well in that case you ad better not fall through the window „ had you
my gorgeous little boy
we never want you to do anything like fall through a window Thomas
you're much too precious for that „ aren't you

your double chins
I think you mean your cheeks
no
you've got too really take care of yourself Tom because listen darling
I know you get cross sometimes when we're walking and Mummy keeps saying hold onto my hand and don't go near the road
seriously Thomas if you went near the road and a car knocked you down I'd never see you again
you'd die
that's right
and you don't want that to happen „ do you
hm
I know you think Mummy gets cross sometimes if she gets very ratty with you
but honestly Thomas it's because Mummy can see dangers that you can't see
and I'm only trying to look after you and protect you
you know that „ don't you
you're going to do what hard on my hand
oh thank you
you're going to squeeze my hand after I've just told you how much you mean to me
and how precious you are
