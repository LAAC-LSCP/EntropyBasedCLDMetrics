it sounds like someone else is driving off in their car
who could that be
I know who it is
it's AuntieLinda
well you can see in a second
because she's driving past the window
well perhaps she as just reversed out of the drive Thomas
to let UncleBrian in
perhaps she needs to go out later
and so that his car doesn't block her's in
where've you been teddy
oh there she goes
can you see Brian
Brian's not at work today
and it as not been a nice day for him to be outside „ has it

I was just wondering how you banged your head sitting down

we needta go the shops to buy some more food
shut the lid
of the box

I'm going to give Purdie something to eat first Thomas
before I shut the lid
because Purdie needs a bite to eat „ doesn't she

Mummy's very worried about you Thomas

what's the matter
spill it
is Purdie all done
Purdie's going to go outside now again „ isn't she
she might get wet in the rain
she'll get her paws wet if she goes on the grass
do you mind if Mummy has her lunch
how about if we put your little chair here
the racing car's here
would you like a bite to eat Thomas
what can you see now

Mark's not there „ is he
do you really not wanna eat anything at all
does your tummy hurt Thomas

and does your head ache
pardon
what are you saying darling
shining
shining down the path
I'm sorry Thomas
I can't tell what you're saying
I know you're talking about the sun shining
perhaps if Mummy cuts up an apple Thomas
would you like to sit through there and eat it
shall we have a little break
did you break the wheel
oh no you haven't
it as just gone up on the window ledge
so it looks higher on one side than the other
that's all that's the matter
you're back in your chair now
feel a little bit more like eating
is that what you wanted
jam on toast
no big one
and look there's a little bit of strawberry here
how about we put that on your toast there
would you like to put the lid back on the jar of jam please
because if it falls on the floor there's going to be jam everywhere „ isn't there
that's right
and let's move it over here
because we've finished with the jam now „ haven't we
yes
some cheese
no
you don't fancy cheese

we've just listened to TheArchers „ haven't we
little boy

she's called Pip
Pip's short for Phillipa
and what as happened to Pip
she's going with her Mummy and Daddy to the hospital „ isn't she
do you remember what happened last week
on Friday
she spilt a very hot cup of coffee on herself „ didn't she
and burnt herself
that's right
she shouted Daddy „ didn't she
because she was hurt
mess all down
yes
it was a real mess „ wasn't it
I think she's feeling a bit better now though „ don't you
so you listened to that on Friday
and you remembered it „ didn't you

and you remembered „ didn't you
what had happened
poor Pip
and she's sposta be starting school as well
a hot drink
yes
it was a hot drink
that's what she said
yes
Daddy had made a hot drink and she spilt it „ didn't she
all down her shirt
that's why you've got to be so careful
when there are hot drinks about
otherwise you'll spill it
we read a story about somebody who has a warm drink „ don't we
in front of the fire
that's right
mhm
that's right
it's your Pippo book „ isn't it
Tom and Pippo have been for a walk
and it's a cold day
and they hafta wrap up with their hats and scarfs and gloves
and when they come home they sit in front of the fire
with a warm drink
and you have warm drinks „ don't you
you have warm milk before going to bed at night
but we never give you hot drinks
Mummy and Daddy drink drinks that are a bit hotter than yours
a little bit hotter
but you've got to be so careful Thomas
no spill it
because you sometimes spill your juice „ don't you
but at least your juice is cold
so it can't burn you
pardon
big tummy
big willie
is that where the juice goes too
does you tummy really ache Thomas
because you've decided to eat some crisps
you've decided to eat some crisps
and you're eating some jam on toast

because we're trying to send something to Dimitra
and it won't go

why did you say that
you talking about a train
oh I see

you're talking about the window ledge and the helicopters
in front of the train
the yellow helicopter you've put it on the window ledge in front of ThomasTheTankEngine

yellow helicopter front of train
I don't know what you're saying now
you're just being giddy „ aren't you

leave the table where it is Thomas
please
look
hot drinks will get spilt
whoops oh dear
is that what you say
oh I see what you're saying
there are ridges in the tablecloth
and you're thinking of road humps in the road
because when we go over road humps you say whoops oh whoops oh dear
so you're looking at the table that's normally smooth
and it as got three or four ridges
is that what it is
whoops oh dear
you'd like the racing car

the cloth's just a little bit wrinkled
it's not broken
oh dear
the racing car driver as got a nice smile „ hasn't he
and a nice big red hat
he as got big red rosy cheeks as well
can you see
oh and he squeaks
I ad forgotten he had a squeak
are you reaching your crisps out of the packet to give it to the racing car driver
that's a good boy for sharing
thank you
he said thank you
I think it's the refrigerator cutting in
every now and then the refrigerator turns itself on and off
and when it starts up it makes a buzzing noise like you can hear now
shall we go to the shops when you've finished your lunch
we'll get changed and go out
no
we're not going to the chip shop
we need some milk
and something for tea
a leaf
oh underneath
you've put the crisp underneath the racing car „ have you
underneath
crunch
yes
if you drive over that it would crunch „ wouldn't it
whoops a daisy
big high up
did you lift the racing car driver out of the car

Purdie's back
she looks happy now it as stopped raining „ doesn't she
on the floor
you wanna lie on the floor and have a sleep
yes

and now you nearly fell on your feet Thomas
be careful

oh oh dear
well shall we just have a little piece of apple first
no
you wanna sleep
we'll see you in the morning
well let me peel this and cut it up
because I've started now
isn't it pink inside
it's made a beautiful color Thomas
the peel's red
but some of the apples have got a very slight pinky tinge
but I mean this is absolutely gorgeous „ isn't it
yes
it's pale now „ isn't it
it's just at the top where it's red
but it really is beautiful
it's nice and tasty „ isn't it
do you think it looks tasty
crunchy as well
mm
well if we're going out and
get out
like that
ah crunching like that
you're going mm mm mm with your teeth „ aren't you
I was just thinking if we're going out in the pushchair
like that
you might like to have a little sleep in the pushchair
what's that funny noise
I think it's the sound of your windmills outside
because it's quite breezy
and they're spinning round really quickly „ aren't they
they're going very fast
and I think it's the rattling noise
has Purdie come back to the window
there you are sweetheart
mm
it looks nice
very pink
I'll just let Purdie in while you're eating that
it's not raining now
the sun's shining
the patio was flooded this morning
it was standing in water
but it as nearly all dried out now
I think Purdie's quite hungry today
more
she as gone back to the door
I don't think she knows whether she wants to be in our out „ does she
Mummy's finger's very sore
where she cut it on the rose yesterday
Thomas too
is your finger sore as well
oh last night you had an accident while you were eating your apple „ didn't you
or was it your bread roll
because we had our tea outside last night „ didn't we
because it was so hot
and you were biting through a crunchy bread roll
and you bit onto your finger
and you made it bleed „ didn't you
and
oh that's right
like that
but don't do it again
and you were so upset „ weren't you
and then what happened
to cheer you up
Mummy went out to buy an ice cream „ didn't she
yes
that's right
I went out to the ice cream van to buy Thomas an ice cream
and myself an ice cream
and then we went to Sue's house „ didn't we
because we were going to the ice cream van
Sue was coming to see us „ wasn't she
and when she realized you were going to have an ice cream she said I won't disturb you
and we went to see her later on
like that
your finger still looks sore
poor Thomas
did the ice cream make it better
no
where as Purdie gone
I think she as gone upstairs Thomas
but I thought I could hear her little paws going pittarpittarpattar
yes
pitter pitter patter
pitterpitter
pitterpitter

well that's how we describe the rain when it's falling
we say it's going pitterpatter
pitterpitter

her paws pattering on the stairs
pitterpatter
you like that phrase „ don't you
Mummy as got to go to work tomorrow
what happens when Mummy goes to work
dentist

and I went into work just for a little while
then I went to the dentist „ didn't I
but tomorrow I'm just going to work

I think when you've had your lunch we'll take you upstairs to change your nappie
and then you can see Norman from the window
Roger too
Roger's the rabbit „ isn't he
they've put a little stone rabbit next to the garden gnome
and the rabbit's called Roger
so now you can say hello Norman
hello Roger
what's Mummy doing
I'm just sitting here Thomas
waiting for you to finish your lunch
and then we can wash your hands and face and get you changed
and we'll go out for a little walk
while the sun's still shining
because it might start to rain later on
and that would be a shame „ wouldn't it
oh well done
you've eaten a whole apple
what would you like
the bread
no
don't tip it out of the bag Thomas
keep it where it is
because if it gets squashed up when we try and put it in the toasting machine it'll get stuck „ won't it
who's coming now
Purdie's back
pitterpatter
we didn't hear her feet going pitterpatter back down the stairs „ did we

her paws are going pitterpatter across the patio
this is bread

would you like a piece of bread
yes
what do you say
that's a sticky
sticky tape
