have you been hiding them
well I washed up last night before going out
oh it's alright I can see them
was just thinking I washed up before I went out
Daddy put the things away and he as put the two spoons in one of your beakers
I can see them now
I know
Mummy's having some cornflakes
so we'll
we'll be able to swap „ won't we
you're making a lot of noise

oh excuse me
excuse me please
I think it feels very cold this morning Thomas
would you like your dressing gown on or are you alright
you're alright
Mummy's going to go upstairs for hers because I feel very cold
you keep looking through the window to see if the postman's coming
and I'll just go and get my dressing gown
who as come back
Sue

she's sitting in her car „ isn't she
is she sitting in the car ready to go to work
we've not seen Sue for quite a long time „ have we
is she going backwards
I'll open the blind a little bit more
yes
she's reversing her car „ isn't she
that's right
she as driven off
she as gone to work „ hasn't she
that's where Mummy as got to go today
and Daddy as gone to work already „ hasn't he
Daddy went to work at half past seven this morning which is quite early
I've just seen two magpies out of the window when I was looking at Sue
that's sposta be lucky Thomas
to see two
if you see one on it's own it's one for sorrow
if you see two together two for joy
happy
happy because we've seen two magpies
happy
what color are magpies
they're black and white „ aren't they
they're those big black and white birds that
look
that Purdie
do you wanna hold the box of cornflakes
what can you see on the box
a picture of the sunshine coming out
that's right
a box of Kelloggs cornflakes
let me have a look
can you see the cockerel
here it is
what does the cockerel say
cockadoodledoo
you have a book
a PostmanPat book
and it talks about AlfThompson one of the farmers
and it says
a cockerel crows at AlfThompson's farm cockadoodledoo
can you remember what happens
MrThompson's milking his cows and PostmanPat gives Dorothy a large parcel
what's in the parcel
green Wellingtons
that's right
and she said
ah Wellington boots just what I need
oh don't open the cornflakes Thomas
because we've got what we want
Mummy as got a bowl of cornflakes
you can have a look at the packet certainly
Thomas change the cornflakes
is it time for us to swap cereal
thank you
there you are
you have my cornflakes
please may I have your Krispies now
thank you
the juice is making a funny noise when you're drinking it „ isn't it
hm
it's making a noise like a steam train

what can you see on the box
what can you see
oh I see
you're looking at the box of cornflakes and there's an advert on the side for some honey RickKrispies
oh I've not heard of honey RickKrispies before because these are ordinary RickKrispies
and it's showing the blue man a green man with a red hat and a man with a red shirt and yellow hat
and the man with the red shirt has got his hand in the pot of honey
it's like jam but it's honey
it's made by the bees
can you see the bees
buzz
the bees are buzzing around the box
no
they won't hurt you
no
because they're on the box
they're just a picture of some bees
I can't get my words out
it's just a picture of some bees I should say
they're not actually bees „ are they
but bees make honey Thomas
who eats honey
WinniethePooh
he as always got a pot of honey „ hasn't he
are you talking about Tom and Pippin and Sonia and Isabel and a potty
maybe
what are you meaning
maybe one day you'll get round to using your potty
maybe
come on Mabel
hm
but you were doing very well with potty training
ready steady go
red stop
green go
red stop
green go
everytime you say green go you have a mouthful of Mummy's cornflakes „ don't you
oops steady now
be careful
you're talking about the ice cream van
Thomas I never ever hear the ice cream van now „ do you
do you think he still comes
you heard it
well you see it's dark now „ isn't it
in the evening
so we have the curtains drawn
so we perhaps don't see him but usually he plays a little tune „ doesn't he
so you'd think we could hear it
because last year he came every single day including ChristmasDay „ didn't he
or perhaps it was every day but ChristmasDay
are you telling me to stop talking so that you can listen for the ice cream bus van
in a minute it'll come and play a tune a moment
I don't think it'll come now Thomas
because even when we knew he was coming every day it was about four five six o'clock
late afternoon early evening „ wasn't it
because there was a little while in the summer when we though he ad stopped coming because we didn't see him
and then after two weeks he came back so he must have been on holiday
thank you big bus big wheels
is that what we say to the ice cream man if we ever buy ice cream
thank you
that's what I don't understand where he is
and the thing is sometimes I think he might have thought it wasn't worth stopping here because whenever he stopped nobody came out to buy ice cream
but you live here
there's little Sam and Josh over the road
Charlotte
no
she's not called Charlotte
I think she's called Georgia
I never know the name of that little girl
and then there's Liam
there's quite a few children
we hardly ever went out but Liam useta go with his Daddy nearly every evening so I can't belief that the ice cream man
Liam not William
Liam
no
don't bang with your spoon Thomas
that's not nice
it's a little bit cold anyway I think to be thinking about ice cream „ isn't it
no
you're messing about now Thomas
would you like to finish these RiceKrispies
Thomas would you like to finish these RiceKrispies
what do you say
no thank you
no Thomas
turn the spoon round properly
you're trying put cornflakes onto the handle
you're being silly „ aren't you
that's it
have you managed
that's a silly way to eat them
you can't go out somewhere and eat that
no
if somebody invited you round for a meal and you ate like that
no
we went to see Ben and Charlotte „ didn't we
yesterday
for lunch
pardon
what are you talking about
the ice cream was funny
you're obsessed with ice cream
oh Lynne gave you an ice lolly „ didn't she
an orange ice lolly
because it was actually quite pleasant yesterday
but it
it was still a little bit cold but we all sat outside „ didn't we
and you were playing with Ben in the WendyHouse
do you remember
something Charlotte
something Thomas
have a Mummy'ss
I'm not sure what you're
cake
well you had cake as well
because what did you have
you each had a little chicken burger and a sesame seed bread bun
and some chips and peas
and then you had chocolate muffin for pudding
and you ate the chips and peas and one piece of bread but left the burger
Ben ate the burger but left the chips and peas
then Lynne said
I wish I ad only done one meal and then it would have all been eaten
then later on in the afternoon you had some Maltesers and an ice lolly
aah
it was all done there
yes
I think you were quite full „ weren't you
you were very tired last night because you ad been at playgroup yesterday morning
and then we ad gone to Lynne's house to play with Ben and Charlotte
and you ad been running round at there house and in the garden
then we walked home
and it wasn't long before it was teatime and then it was bathtime and you were ready for bed „ weren't you
do you remember we had you put your pyjamas on after your bath and then you sat in the car when Mummy went to Choir
and you went to sleep in the car
and when you got home Daddy just lifted you into your bed didn't he
and you didn't know anything about it
because you were awake when we set off
yes
you were awake when we set off in the car
and then all of a sudden it was Wednesday morning
oh
no
don't bang please
Thomas don't bang
no
that isn't nice
no
it's not nice
just eat properly
come on
you've got a special spoon today
you've got Mummy's spoon
you've got Mummy's spoon
you're going to have some toast in a moment
what shall we have some toast
some jam or marmalade or Marmite
Marmite
Marmite
yellow Marmite
you mean marmalade
marmalade and jam
yellow red jam and brown jam
well there's strawberry jam
there's orange marmalade or there's Marmite
now I think Marmite must be what you mean by brown jam „ is it
shall I clear these things
are you finished with your cornflakes
are you still eating them „ are you
that's right
you finish them while I just slice some bread ready for the toaster
you saw Isabel at playgroup „ didn't you
yesterday
she as started with a cold „ hasn't she
Isabel done a wee wee
oh I know what you're referring to
when we arrived at playgroup we heard Sonia shouting Isabel come and do a wee wee „ didn't we
were you impersonating Sonia then
no
I don't think she did Thomas
big spoon's carrying the bowl
have you put the spoon underneath the bowl and you're pushing the bowl along the table
just be careful it doesn't all fall on the floor Thomas
or Mummy'll be cross „ won't she
and I haven't really got time today
going for another walk
I haven't got time to start clearing up
Mummy as trodden on a cornflake
I'm sticky on the bottom of my slipper
oh no
I don't think we need the ambulance Thomas
just because I've got a sticky slipper
I think we'll manage
are you talking about PostmanPat's mobile shop and bye Sam and FiremanSam
the postman hasn't been yet „ has he
no postman
PostmanPat has a poorly leg
ah do you think he has really
Ray doesn't come anymore „ does he
we miss seeing Ray „ don't we
Ray was our postman for a long time and he as moved on
he as gone to HeatonChapel
he doesn't walk round here anymore
so we have lotsof different post people
we never have the same one
a lady comes too
yes
we have a post lady as well as a postman
because when we had Ray we knew Ray and he useta wave every morning „ didn't he
and we useta wave back
and when it was Christmas and Easter we useta give him something „ didn't we
and we can't do that now because we really don't know
eating bread
yes
well I'm just waiting for the toast to pop out of the machine
we don't know who the post person is
tell me when the toaster pops „ won't you
right
have you obviously finished with that now Thomas
let's
look
your little bus is on the floor
Bertiethebus
oh is the bus delivering letters
delivering letters through your door
what do you think
Linda's
and to Rachel
here you are
letter through your door
who's staying with AuntieLinda at the moment
Kate
that's right
it's AuntyLinda's daughter Kate
she's the lady that drives the white car „ isn't she
and she lives in Turkey normally Thomas
which is a very long way away
and she as come back to stay for a few weeks on holiday
oh yes
well we went to holiday
went on holiday to Spain but Kate lives in Turkey
so she as come on holiday to Stockport to see her Mummy
because Kate is AuntieLinda's little girl
just like you're Mummy's little boy Kate is AuntyLinda's little girl
but she's not really a little girl „ is she
she's a big girl
hang on
be careful now
Mummy'll pick it up
I will in a second darling
just let me get some jam on the bread and then you can be eating your breakfast
oh Purdie as had her breakfast already „ hasn't she
I don't think she'll wanna eat it
and Mummy's going to have hers and then I've got to start getting ready for work
there we are
there's some with jam and some with Marmite
and Mummy's going to butter her piece and put marmalade on it
so you can have
hold it
you can have a selection of things this morning
there we are
that looks nice
there you are poppet
mm the toast smells nice „ doesn't it
you're looking very serious
what's the matter
oh no Thomas
pick it up and eat it properly
a bit of juice came
what are you doing
licking the Marmite of the toast
that's how Purdie eats „ isn't it
not how Thomas eats
this is the bottom of the jar of marmalade
what would you like to do
to hold the jar
just a second
let me get the marmalade out to put on the toast
and then you can hold the jar
but you mustn't drop the jar because it's made of glass
and what happens to glass
the glass
what happens to glass if it's dropped
a big smash
a big smash and a crash
and we can do without that first thing in the morning „ can't we
there we are darling
there's a piece now with some marmalade on for you
I'm trying to scrape the bottom of the jar so that you've got enough on there that you can taste it
there you are sweetheart
does it taste good
ah here we are
there's another jar of marmalade in the cupboard
oh I don't think I've got the strength to open the jar Thomas
we need that special top „ don't we
that one's empty and that one's better
it's full
the new one is full
there's somewhere Thomas
I'm not sure what as happened to it
we've got a little rubber disc „ haven't we
that we use when we're having a job to open jars
because it gives us a good grip
and it's usually hanging up there and it's not there now
but I think we properly took it when Mummy was doing some judging in the summer
I think she took it with her so she could open the jars
I can see the postman
he's at the other side of the road
he looks like he might have been to Sue's house
oh Thomas I can't open this jar
oh dear dear dear
I think we'll hafta go without Marmalade
can you still not see him
there we are
we'll try a rubber glove
that's always good
it just gives a bit of extra grip „ doesn't it
oh dear
no
it's no good
I can't open it
no
I'll hafta leave that
see if Daddy's stronger than I am
oh dear dear
a bit of a nuisance „ isn't it
never mind
I'll have some jam
I've not had jam for a while
oh it's not strawberry jam
it's raspberry jam
look
lotsof little seeds
nice red jam
raspberry jam
that's right

you like raspberries „ don't you Thomas
well this one is full Thomas
so you can hold it but you've got to be extra careful
can you see the pictures of the raspberries on the front
are you looking out for the postman
no
no
don't try and get that lid off Thomas
because that one opens very easily
and if you open it and it tips up all the jam's going to come running out „ isn't it
would you like an apple when you've finished your toast
no
it's not a strawberry „ is it
what is it
yes
are you pretend
are you pretending to take the lid off the jar
you're imitating me „ aren't you
no
we don't need that open now
you've got jam on your toast already
no
but keep watching because we know he's walking round
there he is
there's the postman
where as he gone
no
he as gone to
shall Mummy go and see what the postman as brought
what do you think he as brought
he as brought one letter for Mummy
one for Daddy
and for the people who useta live in the house before we did
no
there isn't one for Thomas
and this says privateq
there you are
you have the envelope and I'll see what he says inside
oh it's from Mothercare which is where we buy your clothes „ isn't it
yes
oh it's telling me at Mothercare on the seventeenth of November and eighth of December there's ten per cent off everything all day
oh look
there's a picture of WinniethePooh
they've got a picture of WinniethePooh
and on the back what are they showing there
what can you see
that's the little car that you ride round in at toddler group „ isn't it
oh and it's also telling us there's money off the little Lego sets
the Duplo range
now you play with that quite a lot „ don't you
oh that sounds lovely Thomas
doesn't it
oh because there's a nice safari set here with the elephants and the little jeeps and crocodiles and palm trees
and that was one that we were going to buy
oh I think it's called the SandstoneFamily
it looks a bit like the Flintstones
oh so that's good „ isn't it
is there a boy there
it's a boy like Thomas „ is it
and what's the boy doing on the picture
oh he's playing with a work bench Thomas
he must be pretending he's the joiner or perhaps a builder like BobTheBuilder
look
he as got lotsof hands and all sorts of tools
can you not see elephant
well let me show you
it's there
look
it's a green elephant
well you've already got an elephant from the Lego range
and you're
oh there's another leaflet here
now what's that telling us
oh that's not telling us anything other than it's just showing us some of the things that you can buy in Mothercare
ah gosh Thomas
ah do you know what I can see on the back page
a huge tub of Smarties
a GiantSmartieSuperTub that's called Thomas
yes
I thought
oh what's on the bottom
right
we must keep those leaflets because
if we
you hope to see the Smarties „ do you
I can't see what you're pointing to Thomas
it's something with chocolate
is it a selection box perhaps
another chocolate

oh yes
lotsof chocolates and sweets on the back page
yes
Daddy's sweeties
you're pointing to a KitKat
Daddy likes KitKats „ doesn't he
and what can you see on the front of the leaflet Thomas
what can we see here
what are they
they're called ChatterBugs
they look like little ladybirds but they're not really in ladybird colors „ are they
they're green and yellow
yellow and white
they look a little bit like ladybirds
and look
can you see the mice
some juice
can you see the snowman
snowmen
there's a snowman
and there's FatherChristmas
can you see Noddy
where's Nod
no
you're going to drop your juice Thomas

who are you singing happy birthday to Thomas
oh happy birthday to Noddy
oh right
have you seen Noddy on the television
I just wondered whether it was
you're blowing the candles out and saying hooray
you have a Noddy book upstairs
I'm just wondering whether there's anything about
brushes
yes
well it's a Noddy toothbrush holder „ isn't it
you know at the moment how we put your toothbrush in a beaker with your toothpaste well that's a
let's have a look
that's a special little holder
look
it's a special holder with Noddy and BigEars
now BigEars looks like Normanthelion „ doesn't he
and it's holding two brushes
that's very nice
