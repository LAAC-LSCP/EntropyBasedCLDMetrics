I hope that's not going to be a problem
AuntieLinda and UncleBrian are having a new boiler fitted

for the heating and the hot water
well just because the boilers are quite old now
I won't hurt you

oops

alright let's just have a little break because something's the matter „ isn't it
has somebody upset you
why are you so upset darling

somebody as upset you but you don't know who
and how have they upset you
are you just feeling a little bit tired perhaps
you feel a bit sick
do you not want lunch then
well you were asking for a drink earlier on
do you still want your drink
special
special juice or Vimto

that's better
cuddling Mummy
isn't it
you need a sleep
oh Thomas
do you want a little cuddle with Mummy
that's it
oops mind that cup of coffee
mind that cup of coffee
there we are
right
now you know when you were making this picture today
and you were using glue
did you get any glue on your tongue
did you taste any glue
or did you smell any glue
no
you just stuck it where it needed to be stick
did you eat anything at nursery that might have made you feel a bit sick
you had a chocolate biscuit
you had a chocolate biscuit
now I feel sick
I do
I feel sick because I didn't have a chocolate biscuit
no I couldn't have a chocolate biscuit
I was at home
I was doing lotsof things
in fact I've been to Didsbury this morning to do some shopping
I rushed home and I washed up and then I went into Didsbury and I did all sorts of things in Didsbury
then I came to pick you up
and did you not have your picture of the bonfire ready to show me
it was still gluey „ was it
the glue was drying
and was it a picture you did on your own
or are you all doing a picture of a big bonfire
you're all doing a big picture of a big bonfire
what are you doing
learning about things that happen in autumn
you're making it
mhm
is that ready for bonfire night
mhm
you'd go well with the people letting off fireworks here because they do it very early „ don't they
yes
well have you noticed the difference now Thomas
between a few weeks ago
mind you the weather as not been good at all this summer
but in the summer the few days that we had nice sunny sun we didn't need Wellingtons or warm coats or umbrellas
it was nice and you could wear shorts and sandals and tshirts
sandals
and sun
and sunglass and sun hats
and when we were in Spain we hadta be really careful what we were wearing „ didn't we
so we didn't get too hot
do you remember
but now we're into October we're into Autumn now Thomas
September October November are all Autumn
and this is the time of year when it starts to get chillier
especially in the mornings and the evenings
and it's not as sunny
not as light
and what happens to the leaves on the trees
hm
they change from green
to sort of golden and red and yellow and orange
and they go dry and crispy and the fall off „ don't they
and when you're walking on the path providing it's not raining
if it as rained you just go slip squelch squash

but if it's nice and dry you go crispcrunch crispcrunch crackle crispcrunch
some trees stay green though
Christmas if you see Christmas trees
you know when we're walking up near Isabelle's house near the park
do you remember that house with the big Christmas tree
and the lavender bushes
well that Christmas tree will always be green
the grass will still be green
yes
just the grass might be a bit wetter
but the trouble is in the summer we had such a lot of rain „ didn't we
that really the grass has been pretty wet most of the summer
we've had some nice days „ haven't we
because we've been to the park and to TheBeehive
and to
do you remember at Bethany's party
that must have been about July time
and that was a very hot day
you were all in the sandpit
we've had lotsof sunny days
are you really not very well sweetheart
is it you just don't wanna eat
are you upset because I said it's lunchtime
so if I say to you you don't hafta eat
if you don't hafta eat then will you be a bit happier
right
you don't hafta eat but do you mind very much if Mummy eats
you do mind if Mummy eats
listen MisterMister you've had a chocolate biscuit at nursery
I've had nothing

nothing
so if I don't eat I could be big hungry Mum „ won't I
would you not like something like a pear
or a plum or an apple
okay
okay
okay
is anybody else in nursery not feeling very well
just you
have you got any pains anywhere
no headache
tummyache
no pains in your neck
if you look at the light does it hurt your eyes
does it hurt your eyes
right
does your neck ache at all
yeah
no
are you sure
can I just have a little look at your tummy to see if you've got any dotty spottys
oh please darling
because if you're feeling sick and the lights hurting your eyes I think we ad better just have a look and see if there's any dotty spottys
you might look like Jake out of TheTweenies
dot man
you've had chicken pox „ haven't you
so we're not looking for big chicken spots „ are we
I'm just looking to see if you've any little pin pricky marks
alright
I think we ad better pause the tape „ don't you
if you're really not feeling
not feeling very well
just let me have a little look please
at your tummy
let's have a look
just a little look at your back
I just wanna see if anybody as been out with a red pen
and putting little dots on you
no
nobody as done that „ have they
do you know
no
is this what this is all about
because
you wanna watch television
Thomas Lastname
why do you wanna watch television
no
you're telling me you're feeling sick and poorly and along you just wanna watch some television
what's your favorite
you don't even know what's on
you came in from nursery and I put the telly on for a few minutes
no
but listen I put the telly on while Mummy boiled the kettle and did one or two things
now later on you can watch a little bit more
but Thomas
listen
listen when we're at home we don't sit and watch telly
we usually go out Thomas
if it wasn't for doing a tape we'd be out
I think we will
we wouldn't be in watching telly „ would we
no
listen excuse me
after lunch Mummy puts it on for a few minutes while I wash up and I usually listen to TheArchers then
don't I
and that's when you watch telly for quarter of an hour
just to recharge your batterys
because when you're a little boy you useta have a sleep after lunch
and now you don't need a sleep because you're a big boy
but it's a chance where you can just sit down and we either read a book or you just watch television for quarter of an hour
just to recharge your batterys
I can hear some squeaking
do you think that's the tape recorder
squeak
squeak
well tell me if you put the television on what programmes would you like to watch
CBBC OnChoice
you're laughing now you cheeky thing
do you really feel sick
ThomasHenry
you've had me feeling your neck looking for rashs making you look at the light and all along
there's nothing the matter
well I thought it strange because you went to nursery very happy
you came out of nursery perfectly happy
you are
you know that big bonfire you've been drawing at nursery
what was it like
is there room for somebody on the top
oh that's a shame
because I think I'll put you on top
I was
for kidding your Mum
Thomas you little actor
no
Mummy's having lunch
if you want lunch that's fine
if you don't want lunch
it's now five to one
if you don't want lunch there's nothing else to eat until five o'clock
that's four hours time
you can have a drink of milk at three o'clock
you want a huggle
but listen if you're not eating lunch there's nothing else
no sweeties or anything
you've got to eat meals at mealtime
now would you like to go to the fridge and get some butter out and something for Mummy to put on her toast
some cheese and things
come on
I'll sit here and have a little rest
you can do the shopping in the fridge
how's that
your head feels a bit hot but I think that's because you've been crying and giggling
you've been crying and giggling
do you know what we hafta do as well today
well not today particularly but someday
we've got the church magazines
the October magazines to deliver
so what we can do is after lunch we can have a little walk out
no
but you like going because you like going to the flats
because you can press the lift „ can't you
it's too boring
and what's more exciting than doing that
no it isn't
a little while ago all you talked about was sweetie shops
all you've talked about today is the television
pardon
you wanna watch the telly and eat sweets
no
absolutely no way
oh what's going on outside
oh somebody's having a fight
who's that
it's not Purdie because Purdie's upstairs
goodness me
oh I don't think it's
it'll be Linda's cats
it's not Linda
it might be Felix or Tiddles or Molly
oh dear
it sounded very close
I think it's at our house rather than Linda's „ don't you
I don't know who's fighting
oh there's Molly
there's Molly
so it must have been Molly with somebody
I wonder whether she was fighting with one of her brothers and sisters
oh poor Molly
no I don't think it would be Felix or Tiddles because they all live together „ don't they
she's useta Felix and Tiddles
I think it must have been a stranger
might have been that big grey and white one
and we've not seen GingerBattersby since we came back from Spain „ have we
darling don't sniff please
would you like to use my tissue
there you are
that's it
oh look Molly's going home
she as got a fancy collar round her neck
look at that
she's going to jump up in a minute on our fence
oops
that's it
onto AuntieLinda's conservatory
look at that
oh she looks like she's prowling
she's looking for whoever it was that frightened her
what do you think she's thinking
she's not thinking of the sweetie shop
she's a pussy cat
she might be thinking of crunchy biscuits and fish
and things like that
tins of food milk
she certainly won't be thinking of sweetie shops Thomas
I don't think so
you've done a footprint
a handprint
you better not have done
cheeky
I can't see it
where have you done a handprint
on the patio window
oh
cheeky
you are being a cheeky boy today „ aren't you
right
sit in your chair now please Tom
would you like a little packet of raisins
we've got some really nice raisins
yeah
they are nice „ aren't they
have you already had some of these raisins
it must be Daddy then
because somebody as opened the box
look at these
instead of having them in a little pot and a little container look at these
wow these look nice „ don't they
now would you like some cheese and bread or toast to go with that
some strip cheese
no you're not Thomas
I think you're just saying that love
the trouble is little boys that say things like that one day you really will be feeling sick and you'll say Mummy I feel sick and I'll say oh Thomas stop messing about
and you will be poorly
and nobody will take any notice of you because you've been saying it for such a long time and you didn't mean it
does your head hurt really
have you bumped your head at all today
your head feels sick
it's usually your tummy that feels sick „ isn't it
not your head
I'll get you a plate and then you can pop your raisins straight onto the plate
what do you want
shall we have WinniethePooh BobtheBuilder or the one with the rabbit on
or Teletubbies
BobtheBuilder how's that
so was everybody good at nursery today
I think they're so moist they're stuck together „ aren't they
there we are
gosh they're very big raisins
look at those
they're larger than the ones I got in
oops

in the container in the cupboard „ aren't they
come along raisins
out you come
there we are
how's that
when I was waiting for you outside of the school gate I was talking to Ann's Mummy
and you probably don't remember this but at Christmas when we went to a party's at Isabelle's
I don't mean Isabelle's birthday party but Isabelle's Mummy and Daddy had a party at new year
both at that party and Isabelle's birthday party there was a lady there called Helen
and she was the lady that brought your photograph
you know that photograph up there of you in the green short sleeved shirt
well last year when you had that done at toddler group for some reason they thought you were at school and sent the picture to school and Helen saw it
Anna's Mummy saw it and said that's not a school boy that's Thomas
and she brought it round for us
and her little girl Anna was at Isabelle's party
and she likes you
and you're at the same nursery
and Anna's Mummy told me today that Anna talks about you a lot
when Anna's Mummy says what's your friends called she always says Thomas
do you know who Anna is
is Luke a nice boy
because Luke was the little boy that was so upset at the start „ wasn't he
you know just when you started enjoying it up at nursery
well Luke useta be still terribly upset „ didn't he
and Anthony's a lovely boy „ isn't he
who Anthony
Luke
right
Luke says he feels like a little baby
what does he say that now or when he was crying
oh dear
you don't want it
do you just want one piece
do you just want the plain piece
okay
I'm very sorry I put it on your plate
I just thought you might like it
would you like a banana
okay
you wanna wipe your tears
oh well that's talking about Luke and wiping tears
so what little boys go
I know there's Anthony because he's your best friend „ isn't he
and then we've got Luke
and Matthew
Azar
oh yes
Azar
Azar was the little boy who was terribly upset „ wasn't he
at the beginning
and he's fine now „ isn't he
who says that
Azar
when he's finished doing what does he say that
he says I'm finished
what when he's eating something or when he's done a piece of work
when he's finished doing anything does he say I'm finished
and who's the little girl who says she's finished when she's not and the teachers get cross
Kiera
oh dear
what does she do
drink some juice and say I'm finished
and they go to clear her cup and it's not finished at all
you don't do that
good
you're a good boy „ aren't you
and what about Matthew
does he
is Matthew the boy that's teaching you all these things that you're saying
because often when you say things at home I say who's taught you that and you say Matthew
is Matthew a nice little boy
some more raisins
course we can
no we don't hafta go to the shops
I've got plenty in the cupboard
in the container
yes
that's right
those will be nice to take to MissusPlattford's for lunch „ won't they
what does it say
have a nice day in raisin street

that's a funny thing to say
no
don't say that
is that what Matthew says
pooey
well that's not nice „ is it
AnthonyBathony
oh is this where AnthonyBanthony as come from
I see
I do think Anthony's a nice little boy though
I remember the day when I went to take you and and there were three or four little boys playing round the table
and you went to sit down and it might have been Matthew one little boy said go away Thomas
and you looked really upset
and Anthony said it was Antony not Anthony Antony said don't worry Thomas you come and help me
come and sit on my chair
you can help me
and Antony was ever so upset because you were upset
he's a nice boy „ isn't he
it's his birthday in February
well he's two months younger two months older than you
because your birthday's in April
so I would think in about four months time I can't remember what date his birthday is
in about four months time Antony will be four
and in six months time Thomas will be four
your raisin container says have a nice day in sweetie shop „ does it
it would „ wouldn't it
hm hm
no what does it say
hm
what raisin pips like grape pips
no what does it say
hm hm
would you like some more raisins
pardon
no thank you
we've got some nice pears
okay
yes he's a very nice boy „ isn't he
I like Antony
I don't really know
I can't remember what Matthew looks like
what other little boys are at nursery Thomas
course you can
yes
what other little boys go to nursery
we've got Luke Matthew Antony Azare and Thomas
you only go in the morning „ don't you „ to nursery
but in the afternoon there's another little boy called Thomas
because you're called the morning Thomas and he's called the afternoon Thomas
are they stuck again because they're so juicy

there you are sir raisins
roll roll up get your raisins
look at that one
that's huge
oh no it's not
it's about three stuck together
oh more in the packet

a blonde haired one
that's right
well she's
it's not orange it's blonde
yes blonde
fair hair
fair hair because she's not really blonde
Anna's blonde
oh well
no you can't just keep eating raisins so you've got empty packets to make a building
you've got lego bricks for doing that
I don't want you to eat too many otherwise you will have an upset tummy
do you sometimes have fruit at nursery
here comes a big what darling
a big dortion
what's a dortion
it means a heavy load
a dortion means a heavy load
what can you mean
oh right
I really can't think what you mean by a dortion
it's like a fork lifter with sharp nails
a dortion
I don't know what a dortion can be
you've lost me on that one Thomas
the sun's shining
have you noticed
oh look there's the grey and white pussy cat
that must be the pussy cat that was upsetting Molly
I think he looks like a nice cat but he's quite vicious „ isn't he
now that GingerBattersby's not here the grey and white one seems to have taken over
well he'll have a job unless he comes inside because Purdie's fast asleep upstairs
because just before lunch I went to see if
he's being cheeky
he's walking over your tractor
what shall we call him
we can't just call him the grey and white one
would you like to think of a name for him
we're going to call him fence
we can't call a pussy cat fence

that sounds silly

bye bye
hello

I thought you were ringing the shop doorbell to come back for some more raisins
mhm

the door
a pussy cat walking round the raisin shop
I don't think pussy cats like raisins really „ do they
isn't it nice
the sun's out

you sound like the Tweenies

you suddenly feeling better

you can be the shopkeeper

that means that Daddy Purdie Thomas and myself can each have two
you're going to give me four
hello there
have you nearly sold out

oh I'm just looking at the equipment and the orange light's flashing on and off again
I wonder why
I don't know what the problem is
well have you got enough to give me eight
yes he does please
yes
and I would imagine Thomas likes big ones
oh there's banging now next door as well
the workmen must have been having their lunch before I think „ mustn't they
they're taking out an old boiler and putting in a new one
well I don't think they've made the new boiler
I would imagine that
in fact I know it came ready made Thoomas because there was a big box outside that said combination boiler
but they'll hafta take the old boiler from the airing cupboard upstairs
that as hadta come out
so I don't know whether that's what the banging is now
and then in the kitchen which is quite near to the room we're in now
so there might be quite a lot of banging unfortunately but I think it's going to go on for a couple of days
so we might have it tomorrow as well

the wind came up and blew the raisins down
how many are left
three
there are three
yes
yes my love
okay
yes
there you are
if the packet is empty there's nothing in it Thomas
what do you say
well how about we take some from Mummy's tub
and put them into your little boxes
and save the little boxes for when you're going to nursery and you need a packed lunch
does that sound like a good idea
mhm
I'll put some raisins in a little bowl
are you sneezing
oh dear
that sounds like a bad cold
why are you sneezing
right
there you are
Mummy as put some raisins from her tub into this little ThomasTheTankEngine bag
they don't look quite as nice as the ones you've been eating
when we've eaten these I'll hafta go to the shop and buy some more
because my tub's nearly empty now
what do you enjoy eating when you go to MissusPlattford's because
raisins
normally you eat lunch at home but on Tuesdays and Thursdays you go to MissusPlattford's „ don't you
yes certainly
it will be heavy if it's full yes
okay
right you're walking down a street and you see me
okay
when you're ready
hello
are you the man from the raisin shop
oh that would be very nice please
you didn't notice that one
did you
oh
well I'd rather not have one that as dropped on the floor if you don't mind

it doesn't matter if it as been on the floor because you've got a toothbrush
fair enough
I'd really rather not have one that as been on the floor though
it's not nice eating things that have been on the floor „ is it
toothpaste
how've we suddenly got onto toothbrushes and toothpaste Tom
are you
so Tuesdays and Thursdays Mummy picks you up from MerseyVale and we go all the way to Didsbury
and Mummy as always got some packed lunch waiting for you „ hasn't she
with sandwiches and fruit
and usually something like a little packet of raisins
or a little packet of biscuits
some sort of treat
and a drink
and then do you sit with all the other children and have your lunch
do you sit with the other children and have your lunch
jammy dodgers
mm
do all the children stay for lunch
or just a few
because we haven't got time to come here
come home here have lunch and get to Didsbury for one o'clock
so it's much easier on those two days is take lunch with us
and does Jonathan stay for lunch
and what does Jonathan eat for lunch
does he
when he as finished eating it or while he's eating it
oh my goodness me
and what does MissusPlattford say
well Jonathan's a lot younger than you „ isn't he
he was only two in August
and is that all he eats for lunch
a banana
and does he have a banana every day

and does he get in trouble for walking around with his food
who smacks his tummy
I can't imagine anybody smacks anybody's tummy at nursery
does she perhaps just pat it or rub it
well why does she smack it Thomas
because she's walking about
oh do you mean she runs into him
oh so she bumps into him rather than smacks him
smacking is not very nice „ is it
BuzzLightyear goes whoosh
you talking about BuzzLightyear on the television or is there somebody at nursery you call BuzzLightyear
Antony likes BuzzLightyear „ doesn't he
and you too
I don't really like him
does that matter
I like the Teletubbies and
well I don't dislike BuzzLightyear but I like things like Teletubbies and Tweenies and PostmanPat
I might do when I'm a bit older like you
yes
yes I might do

when you were younger you useta say hello Noddy „ did you
oh I know what you're talking about
yes
Nana and Grandad took you to Macdonalds one day and the free gift in the happy meal was a BuzzLightyear but neither you Nana or Grandad knew who BuzzLightyear was
and you called the little figure Noddy „ didn't you
and then when you brought him home at least Mummy knew it was BuzzLightyear
oh so I see what you mean
you useta think he was called Noddy „ didn't you
