right what are we going to do now Thomas
play
well what would you like to play with
what's there
the microphone
yeah
well it should be there „ shouldn't it
don't go in there please
come here
Thomas come in here
come in here please
what do you wanna play with
the builder
what's playing with the builder
oh I'm the builder „ am I
oh I see
I'm a builder but I drive a taxi
I see
well surely I'm a taxi driver in that case
aren't I
oh I can't get the aerial to work again on this thing
well I don't understand it because most of the time it's fine
the orange light's on
and then we'll just go through a phase of not working again
pardon
apple face
who's apple face
Jeannine
I don't think she'd be very pleased if you called her apple face
you said Dimitra before that „ didn't you
you said Dimitra before you said apple face
no I don't think
yes
oh yeah I think apple is fine
but apple face isn't nice
it's not nice calling anyone something face
because that's
and even name calling that's not nice „ is it
I think Gillian likes being called apple
I think apple face
yeah but I don't think she would like apple face
yes I'm listening
yes
yes
right
I think it would be pretty dangerous to go shopping at a rubbish tip „ don't you
can you get everything you wanna play with
what have you done
how have you hurt your toe
Thomas whatever are you doing
what do you need
right
what do you need sweetheart
well I'm come and have a look
what is it we're looking for
what are we looking for cherub
I'm
right
a flap
well the thing's
that came with that bit
with this set are over here
I think you'll find
might very well be in that little box
all I would say Thomas is it's very hard plastic that
and hard plastic breaks when you tread on it
so when you're finished playing with it
yes it's perfectly alright with
all I'm saying is when you're finished playing with it
back in the box please because if we tread on it you'll be upset
and the other thing is if you tread on it it'll hurt your foot and it'll spoil the set so
have you not
well I can help with that
alright I see but you know what you're doing
do you
I'm just having a little search round
for
yes
a tiny screw
because
well I know and I don't think I knew what it was from
and I have a jar that I put everything in that I don't know what it is
and then one day when we're looking for something we think ah it might be that
now
this aerial keeps falling out of the equipment
I sorted it out the other day and it's

I'm just looking to see if we've got a tiny screw because if we have chances are
that's where it's come from
oh there's a screw look
don't
this is
well that is a very tiny screwdriver that you use
if your glasses
because look can you just see
stand up and watch that plastic
I've just warned you about treading on that
no
not on there
right you just come and have a look here
can you see how tiny that screw is
there that's holding Mummy's glasses together
well an ordinary screwdriver just wouldn't be strong enough so you have this and it's a tiny screwdriver look to tighten glasses up
or very small screws
now
inside
well maybe not on this one but the one I've got
I've got another one with a battery in
you unscrew that barrel and inside there's an even smaller screwdriver that you can you can twist on
so that's why we have a very
minute screwdriver
it does say police station „ doesn't it
rubbish station yes
I will
yeah
right well that says
danger
that's caution
that means caution „ doesn't it
well it's still danger „ isn't it
it means tread very carefully
go very carefully
well did it break
huh
you're jolly lucky then „ aren't you
ah
I think I might have found it
the thing that we're missing
right
I think I might have done
but I need that little screwdriver again Thomas
no it's not glasses it's the the microphone
because I remember finding this tiny thing on the floor when I was hoovering
and I thought I wonder what that belongs to
so I put it in a special pot and now I think I know what it is
not the screwdriver
I think it's the missing part of the screw
would you like to come and have a look
okay well I'm busy fixing something as well
we're both busy fixing something „ aren't we
MrFixit
well providing it's the right screw that I found
you think yours is what
loose
is it
you don't know what's wrong
well I was trying to be very smart the other day and
I thought I'd put a piece of blue tack in to hold the aerial
which was absolutely fine
now I can't get it out
so it wasn't quite so smart „ was it
I wonder if I need a longer screwdriver
do you think that would help
do you think so
right well I tell you what then
I'll go for a longer screwdriver in that case
yes
I will
I think I oughta try and mend mine first though because mine is holding the aerial
and if the aerial's not working then the tape isn't working properly
right
but I really needta get on with the tape because if Daddy comes home we won't have the house quiet „ will we
oh there we are
we've got two barriers that work now
how's that
there you are
that's you mended
yes
that's you
that's you mended
that's you mended and now it just leaves me to get mended
you've put your barriers going „ have you
the trouble is Thomas when you're concentrating on something like you are now
you're not saying an awful lot „ are you
that's how it should be really
when you're working hard there's no time to chitchat
but
chitchatting is chitting
you know having a chat
having a talk
but
so I don't get lonely
I think it would be quite nice if you could talk to me
because I'm busy working now on this
and because I'm concentrating
I'm
well I'm talking a little bit but if you could talk to me that would be better „ wouldn't it
then I could concentrate on this and keep quiet
yeah
yes
oh very good
well your job's worked „ hasn't it
what's that
oh good heavens
well I can help if you need help
mhm
you call and I will do my very best to help
okay that's what friends are for
that's teamwork „ isn't it
if you can't manage on your own with anything Thomas never be afraid to ask for help „ will you
I think people would far rather you asked then you struggling
yes
oh dear
you broken it again
when I was at school Thomas I had a teacher
called MrsMcNicholas who was my maths teacher
and she useta have a little saying
she useta walk up and down the classroom saying if you get in a muddle you only hafta ask
what's happened
it won't
does it
oh dear
it's not a good start at all that „ is it
no
and I'm hoping that I'm going to good finish in a minute because I'm hoping mine will work
it'll be very
ah it has actually stayed in this time
but
oh it seems to be working
hey that'll do
oh it isn't actually
the aerial's stayed in it's not falling out
but it's not working
but I think that might be as well because I haven't got anything
that screwdriver's
what do you need help with
this what barrier
bliming
oh that's alright then
wondered what you said at first
oh dear
well mine isn't good news Thomas because I've got it to stay in but it won't it doesn't seem to be working at all
and why is that
because what
well I thought I'd worked very hard on that
obviously didn't work hard enough „ did I
oh yes I did haha
look at this

ah perhaps it's the inside one
now look can you see that little screw I found
I put it in the bottom and the aerial's no longer dropping out
but the joint hasta stay on
and it's on there but when I let go
and yet it worked before „ didn't it
the other day when I used that blue tack it worked perfectly
and now I've found the proper thing
oh dear
I wonder if Daddy's any good at something like this
you've fixed yours „ have you
Mr and MrsFixit that's us Thomas
ah I've just discovered there's another screw right there
which needs a special screwdriver called a Phillips screwdriver
which Daddy has
and I'm just wondering whether
do you
sorry
nice
well if I don't play with you now Thomas it's because I'm sitting here like a sillybilly holding this aerial because look when I sit like this
it works perfectly
the orange light's on
but when I let go
I can't sit like this „ can I
what do you think
you'll hafta start calling me Amber
you'll hafta start calling me Amber
yes
well do you know why Amber
because when I sit like this the amber light's working
yeah
why's yours not working
because what
so rubbish
well I think I might hafta dangle mine

dingle dangle scarecrow
well dangle you know hold something up
dangle it from the air
it's still not jolly working
but I don't know what to dangle it from
string
but I don't think it's really very safe dangling a piece of
the dust lady's here now
they're coming now
what do I hafta do
I'm backing up look

truck reversing
beep beep beep
truck reversing
beep beep beep beep
no
right
right I'm getting out of my cab and I'm trotting round
trot
oh they're heavy these wheelie bins
oh somebody must have had a good party because they're absolutely full of wine corks
oh dear
I've dropped some rubbish on the road
I'll sweep it up in a minute
pardon
need a good shove
you mean a good shove
oh right
what I dropped on the floor
put those in the wheelie bin
and then shall we have another go
it is cracked on top of this Thomas so please don't sit on it because it'll crack
there's just that one thing I can't get out
yeah
well don't sit on it
there we are
right
there we are
I've put the bins back
at the side of the house where they belong
will you get down please
right
I'm off now
broom
and what do they usually have on the dustbin trucks
flashing lights „ don't they
mhm
now how did I do on my first day
cool
was it cool
yes certainly
sorry
knobs and screws
are they broken knobs and screws or are they rusty ones
new ones
ah on the dustbin trucks
I thought you meant the rubbish that you were emptying was knobs and screws because I was going to say if it's not old knobs and screws then it's a shame that people are throwing those away „ isn't it
fill up your bins
fill up your bins
hm
well I think you could help as well because I seem to be doing all the work here
you're what
yes
yes
I did
why is that robber running away

I did see him actually
yes he's wearing yellow and black „ isn't he
has he got a black cap on Thomas

oh that rascal
is that a policeman now that's coming along
have you
did you
but then what happened
did you found him on the high street
but then what happened
did you let him go again
why did you let him go
did he

I don't think you can put them on very well pc Plod „ do you
if he escaped
well there we are
the robber
is the robber trying to hide in the wheelie bin

oh that'll hurt him
I don't think policemen are sposta hurt people when they arrest them „ do you
oh listen
oh there's an alarm going off
I bet that's the alarm from wherever the robber's just broken into
don't you
he's washing his hair „ isn't he „ Daddy upstairs
I can hear him as well
well why is the dustbin man naughty
where's the dustbin man
ah he must be coming now
why do I need the dustbin man there Thomas
well I can see a camping van coming but that's not answering wheelie bins
the camping van's not going to wanna clear the rubbish away „ is it
oh and here's a police car
hello policeman
oh good
so presumably there's a policeman going in the car
who will help this policeman who's sitting on the side of the road
whoever
oh look
the robber's wearing a yellow jumper so he matches the yellow wheelie bin
and the policeman's dressed in black so he matches
the black one
policeman's not wearing a helmet
have you noticed he's just got brown
brown hair
oh jolly good
here's the dustbin truck
do you think the policeman and the robber are absolutely exhausted after chasing each other

luckily here's the dustbin truck
now what's the dustbin man going to do about it
oh I see he's come to collect the robber
right robber's gone in the rubbish truck
well you can't put the policeman with the dustbin truck „ can you
oh
that's awful
poor policeman
you can't do that
you can't crush the policeman
I don't think so Thomas
well the policeman driving the car will arrest you if he sees what you do
he is a flat policeman „ isn't he
flat as a pancake
will because he's been flattened
he's rather a fancy policeman
he's a city police
isn't he
have you seen how his arms wave and his little legs
look at his boots
they're smart
look he's wearing sturdy boots for patrolling the streets
walk
having a nice celebration
oh yes well that's what I was meaning before
yes it was meant to be
wonderful celebration
because as you said there are lots and lots and lotsof wine corks
hello
what is going on here
blues
have you seen my colleague
he's dressed like me and he was chasing a yellow robber
have you seen him
a car's run over him
I've had reports that a dustbin man was seen putting a robber and a policeman in the dustbin truck
may I check it out please
oh yes there's only cork
yes sorry to have troubled you dustbin man

oh phew you got away with that
oh dear
I thought he was going to find you
find you with a squashed policeman and a squashed burglar „ didn't you
but luckily he only saw the corks that had gone in afterwards
that's quite lucky for you that „ isn't it
what a relief
I can see a taxi parked up
now what's the taxi go to do with everything
he's having
oh I see the driver is having a little snooze „ is he
is that the police car that's riding the truck
hello
have they
was it not you dustbin man
did somebody report somebody
goodness me a police car
how on earth did that get in there
because that's too big to go into your wheelie bin
who
but they must have been jolly strong to pick up a police car and throw it into the dustbin truck
and I think the police car would be too big surely to get into that dustbin truck
don't you think
it was very naughty I would have said
dear me
I'm not quite
yes please
I'm not quite sure who you are now Thomas the policeman or the dustbin truck driver
are you
oh I see
you seem to be doing the work of a policeman
are
are you going to take the policeman with you in your truck
so he can see what naughty things are going on
where are you brumming to
chasing the robber
what
oh dear
that can't be the same policeman and robber though that went in the dustbin truck because they were both flattened „ weren't they
pc Pancake and RobberFlat
ha RobberFlat
break into a flat and take things from it
rob a flat
would you like a drink
okay
is it break time

well I'm not sure whether you're a policeman a robber or a dustbin man but you've worked very hard whoever you are
so I think it probably is time for a little break „ don't you
okay
what are you doing
scratching my back
oh that's okay
I like my back scratched
ah that's lovely Thomas
you like having your back scratched „ don't you
why
what are you going to get
oh yes that's really nice
that's a little back massage „ isn't it
that's lovely
this is a little dolphin we have that's actually a back massager
oh yes
that
no not really
it tickles a little bit but it's nice
it's not an unpleasant tickle „ is it
I can
it works much nicer than your hands actually
because it's got fins and tails and all sorts of things
now would you prefer it there on top of your pyjamas
how's that
you're still wearing your pyjamas „ aren't you
not got dressed yet
still quite early in the morning though „ isn't it
is it
oh yes it is on the wrong way
