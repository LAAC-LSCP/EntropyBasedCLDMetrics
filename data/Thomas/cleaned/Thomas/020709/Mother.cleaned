no
be careful
you're posting it
you looking at it
that's for Linda „ is it
and for Brian
oh I see
you're talking about for Brian and then that squirrel on the bench eating nuts
there are a lot of letters
another program it showed being collected at the post office and they went to the sorting office „ didn't they
didn't they move quickly on that big machine
do you remember
and there was a machine that read the postcodes
and they just shhshhshh really quickly „ didn't they
all the way along
lotsof letters through your door
yes
we've got a new postman „ haven't we
we haven't got Ray anymore „ have we
lotsof letters
yes
they're coming out of the back
hafta secure the post box at the back
I can see you
I can see you
oh
shall I start putting them on the floor
see if we can make the jigsaw puzzle
some for Dimitra
two ones
it's two letters
not two ones
no
don't climb on the chairs Thomas
go round please
are we going to do this together
no
do you not want it
not want it
not want it
thank you
that's what we say when the post comes through the door „ don't we
do we shout thank you to the postman
thank you
there's lots
a lot of letters
there are lotsof letters „ aren't there
all done
do you mean the post office is closed now
the letters have gone to bed „ have they

I can see you
Mummy's doing the jigsaw down here Thomas
are you going to help
coming out of the washing machine
I thought it was the post box
is it not the post box
look
oh don't break it
no
let's just finish it
don't break it up
Thomas we post the pieces in a minute but let's just complete the jigsaw
you enjoyed doing one the other day
oh please
no
ah
that's WinniethePooh
I wanted to see what he looked like
well I'm trying to make him look like this WinniethePooh on the box with his little jar of honey
do you wanna do the jigsaw
you're going to post the pieces
okay
I think we needta put a bit of tape on the box „ don't you
a lot of letters
a lot of letters
are you going to count them as they're coming through
what sort of letters are they Thomas
brown ones
blue ones
Gordon
do you mean green
ah you're not sposta see that
are they birthday cards
and are there some bills
they're happy birthdays „ are they
they're birthday cards
is that for Po
and what else do you think can come through the post
sometimes we get newspapers and magazines „ don't we
is that eh the newspaper
a NooNoo
oh because it's blue
what else do we get through the post Thomas
what else
what do we get
stoffit
I don't know what you mean
it'll soon be time be time for Christmas cards „ won't it
Christmas card all day
yes
we'll probably be writing Christmas cards all day
no
I think they're just about done now
that's it
no more letters to go through the post box
what about this
no
more letters here
where
they've all gone
more what
more stoffies
Thomas what is stoffies
no don't eat it
what are stoffies
I think stoffies is a name you've made up „ isn't it
does stoffies mean junk mail
shut the door
more letters through there
listen
that's a loud aeroplane „ isn't it
that might be some letters going airmail
because the letters that you're posting will probably end up going in a post van
yes
PostmanPat's being delivered
or some of them posting letters
it'll go from here in the van to the sorting office and then it'll go in a sack and on a train to York „ won't it
and then it'll be sorted out again in York and delivered in red van to Grandma's house
but if we were writing to AuntieRuth the letter would go in an aeroplane like we did to Spain
the letter would go in a bag and go all the way to Spain in an aeroplane and be delivered to Ruth in Spain
well Ruth lives in America „ doesn't she
but I'm just meaning it would go in a plane like we did
so were are these letters going
are they going on the train or in an aeroplane
they're on a plane so they're airmail letters „ are they
what did the pilot say
that's right
yes
the pilot told you hadta keep your straps on so you didn't fall out of the aeroplane
I don't think the pilot will insist that the letters wear a strap though „ do you
but they're all tightly secured in their sack Thomas with the top tied up „ aren't they
so they don't fall out
oh
ah
ooh dear dear
the postman didn't shut his doors and some of the letters have fallen out
and while you're playing with that shall Mummy start doing another jigsaw
no thank you
you've dropped three
shall I pick them up for you
pardon
yes of course Mummy
what about yes please
that's better
there you are
two letters there
and there's another letter
I'll post through to you that way
do you bring them to Mummy
thank you
I'll put them in that box
there are some people here on the floor who might like some letters Thomas
TinkyWinky sitting here with rabbit waiting for a letter

NooNoo's saying I wonder if there're any letters for me today in Thomas's post box

I bet you haven't delivered any to the farm today „ have you
well there're people waiting on the farm
jumped out
they're like at the sorting office
shall we sort the letters out
all the ones that belong to the Teletubbies needta go in this box and all the letters that belong to WinniethePooh needta go in this post box
that's right
they're WinniethePooh letters „ aren't they

oh while you're making a mess I'm going to have a look at this book because I can see a picture of a squirrel
where as the squirrel gone

what can you see here
some chickens and
a baalamb
did you say baalambs or did you call them something else
bollops
Thomas what's a bollop
no
you're being silly now
you're making up silly words for things
this is going to take a long time to clear up
I hope you've got a lot of time
no
you're not jumping on the sofa
Daddy said no „ didn't he
Daddy said no the other night
Daddy'll be home soon
he's not going to be pleased of he sees you doing that „ is he
no it's not ladder Thomas
it's silly „ isn't it
well this is a picture of summer
all the things that you're likely to see in the summer
and you spotted the ice cream with the chocolate flake sitting in the top
no

that's right
that's how you get the pieces out
what's the picture of
the beach
the sea and the sun
what else can you see
no
Thomas
now look
you're hitting the china cabinet now
ready steady
ready steady what
no
I don't like you doing that Thomas
I'm not happy
Mummy's not happy
and Dimitra's not happy if you're doing that
if you're sick of playing with the jigsaw shall we put them away and get something else to look at
what would you like to play with
that sounds like you're making a piggy noise
do you wanna get your tractor
the tractor's over there
it's full of animals
Dimitra will sit down yes
what as happened to the digger
he's over here
there you are
what pieces
the animals
from this jigsaw
Thomas you're not being very gentle „ are you
is just the small pieces you're looking for
there're quite a lot of small pieces here look that'll fit into the digger quite nicely „ won't they
it's quite alright
what're you doing
you're rearranging yourself
now what're you going to do with the pieces now you've out them in the digger

I think the poor farmer's not though
he needs to sit there „ doesn't he
no space
no
it's pretty full of animals Thomas „ isn't it
what're you tipping in
because the jigsaw puzzle was a picture of a tree with leaves „ wasn't it
what's this
it's not a snotsnot
it's a pig
no it's a pig Thomas
you're thinking of it's snout
a pink with a snout
a snout
but it's still not called a snout
it's called a pig
it's not a snotsnot
you just made that word up snotsnot
no
look
there's two farmers
two cows
two sheep and two pigs
but we've only got one dog „ haven't we
do you think the dog would like to sit with the bear from the Teletubbies
then he won't be lonely „ will he
if he sits with the bear
it's like Noah's Ark now
they're all in pairs „ aren't they
oh Thomas

can it not get past the big wheel
is he saying thank you
another one
Toby the tractor as got a nice face „ hasn't he
