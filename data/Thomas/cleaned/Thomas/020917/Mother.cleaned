this little piggy stayed at home
and what did this little piggy have

have a look at them
you're closing your eyes „ aren't you
green and white
slippers
on the end of your feet

you don't like my feet
well I don't particularly like my feet Thomas
I don't really like anybody's feet
but I like yours because they're cute and they smell nice
I like Purdie's feet because they're pretty as well
I don't
paws
that's right
Purdie as got paws
I don't like anybody else's feet
yuck
yuck
well while we're sitting here we might as well do fingernails as well „ hadn't we
fingernails
we can do the same little rhyme but we know different ones for fingers „ don't we
what about one two three four five
are you going to say it

aren't you going to say that again on your own
you were clever because when you got to number ten you carried on to number eleven „ didn't you
I heard you say number eleven
just sit very still sweetheart
otherwise I might cut you
are you going to sing the little rhyme again
one two three four five
please sit still Thomas because I can't do it

which is your right
no
this one
that's right
and which is the left one
very good
right
just sit still now darling again
I'm sorry
why're you talking about cars and tractors
can you see something
Thomas sit still
tractor in your field
which field
which field
where
on the tablecloth
ah but there's no tractor and car
you're pretending there's a tractor there „ are you
there's really just a hairbrush „ isn't there
your nails grow very quickly Thomas because it's only last Thursday that we cut them
do you remember
that day you got your fingers really dirty and Mummy cut your fingernails very short „ didn't she
remember that
steady now
no
no banging
what can you see looking out of the window
you can see something
what can you see
right
this is the last one now
this is this little finger on the left
we know other rhymes about fingers
no
you've got to just sit still sweetheart
because otherwise
come on
last one
then you can go
we know other rhymes with fingers but I don't think we can do them tonight
I'll just finish doing this
I didn't mean to cut them quite so short
oh dear
never mind
right
what's this
TommyThumb
TommyThumb where are you

Purdie's here

hello Puss

it is nice to see her „ isn't it
you like Purdie's paws
Mummy doesn't
pardon
she's licking your bicycle
I think she was just having a little sniff
I don't think she was licking it
we'll get the keys and open the door
she can trot outside
little sniff
with her nose
she was going
she was smelling
you sniff with your nose „ don't you
sniffing
well she as gone out now
right
let's have a go at this again

it's a sausage roll bag but it as got hot cross buns in it

MrSmall MrSmall where are you
here

you can't take your finger off

you haven't got plasters in it
no
but you'd need a plaster if you pulled your finger off
no
this is the bag that we got from the baker's Thomas
let me show you
it's the same place that we buy sausage rolls from but it as got hot cross buns in it because we bought those yesterday
is Purdie here again
shall we let her in
let her in to eat
come on Puss
no just
yes
oh be careful Thomas please
no
you mustn't do that darling
you mustn't touch that
she's sniffing again
do you know why she's sniffing this time
because the ginger pussy cat as paid a visit
and she can tell he as been around because she can smell him
so she as gone out again to go and look for him
and she'll probably say
what have you been doing on my door ginger pussy cat
do you think she will
do you think she'll get cross with him
what will she say
you don't know
oh I don't know
I dread to think
right
are you going to pop your bottom down here a second
would you like some milk now
no
you'd drink it though if I gave it to you „ wouldn't you
yes
I thought you would
pardon
you're not saying yes please
is that because you don't want milk or because you're a rude boy
because you're not
yeah
just be careful you don't fall
she as gone outside
I think she as gone to have a word with the ginger cat
the ginger pussy cat as got a snotty nose
that's not a nice thing to say
who as told you that
yes
but who said to you that ginger pussy cat as got a snotty nose
because that's
has he got a big willie
mhm
you know a lot about the ginger pussy cat „ don't you
you know far more about him than I do Thomas
where's your tractors

oh I don't think you need this in there
no
you might well wanna play with the nail scissors but I don't think so Thomas
you'll end up cutting yourself
oh look
she's back now
Purdie's back
what do you think she said to him
has she stopped being cross
do you think
what have you been doing Purdie
Thomas wants to know
what did you say
she as not
she hasn't
Purdie's a little girl
she's not a little boy
she's a little girl
well we haven't turned it on yet
that machine hasn't stopped
I've poured the milk into the bottle and I've put it in the microwave but we haven't flicked the button yet
we'll do that in a moment
are you ready for it
right
okay then
sit still
we'll have a little go
are you
you're a crocodile
you're sniffing
no
it's just the picture on the television „ isn't it
we haven't got the sound on
what is it
a hundred and one Dalmatians
spotty dogs
what is
the dog
is it
yes
sleeping like this the big green Purdie one
why did you say the green one
has she got a green collar around her neck
has she really
yeah
all right
and what do you mean she woke up and it had all gone
oh right
oh dear
Purdie dog went to sleep
when she woke up the puppys had all gone
who ad taken them
that lady
CruellaDeVille
oh she's not a nice lady „ is she
oh yes I can see
oh she doesn't look a nice lady „ does she
has she pinched all those puppys
aah
aah Mummy and Daddy dog are going to be very upset „ aren't they
oh dear
would you like to help me in the kitchen for a second
and then we'll have something to eat
would you like that
that is
I don't know but I can see the dogs on the television now „ can't you
have you got some Dalmatians upstairs
soft toys
right
if you climb up onto there
I'm going to put some salt in the dishwasher
I don't think you've seen this happen before
are you close enough
let's move those things first
and move you a little bit nearer
there
right
now that's inside the dishwasher
we'll take that off
and then
lotsof water
and that's a special funnel
have you seen that
it's called a funnel
you put it in there
and it just helps pour things into a different place more easily
I'll leave that there a second
put sausages in it
no
I'd rather you didn't
now this is called dishwasher salt
it's a special salt
it's not like the salt that we have in salt and pepper Thomas
and we pour it from this bag into there
like that
it went rather quickly „ didn't it
can you see it pouring down the hole
well I don't think it should have gone down there
there'd only a couple of granules that've just spilt „ haven't they
and gone down the other side
right
let's lift the funnel up
look
it as all gone „ hasn't it
now what I've got to do
I should have left the machine plugged in because the reason I know it needs salt is because when it needs salt this little red light comes on
can you see
and that says salt
and that means salt in it
and we keep putting salt in until the red light comes out
sometimes it's full enough and it forgets to switch off
so we put the funnel back in
like that
has it gone off now
right
well there's obviously enough salt in there
this happens sometimes
when I put the lid on the light goes off
right
so now we needta screw that cup on again
screw the cup on
there we are
and then we can put the basket back
it's spinning around
that's called the arm on the dishwasher
yes
it's spinning around
and then we put this back in
this is the basket
and when we wanna wash something we put powder in that one and then this is where the rinse aid goes
let me show you this
just hafta leave you a second
and you must be ever so careful never to touch any of these things that Mummy's putting in the dishwasher
because they'll burn your skin
they'll burn
and that wouldn't be very nice
now we've got lotsof things in this cupboard „ haven't we
where we keep all the cleaning material
what do you like
like it hot
anyway
can you just stand up a bit
you never ever touch any of these things
because if they touch your skin oh it'll be sore
it'll hurt
right then
that's called rinse aid
and that needs to go
can you see this little tube here
it needs to go in there
and we hafta pour this down this little chute
little chute
can you see it coming out of the bottom
going down the red
the red pipe
and as we're pouring it you can see it filling up here
yes
we can't pour it straight into the pipe
we hafta put it in this little tank here
quite clever
there
can you see it riding there
oh don't you touch it sweetheart
because as I say it'll burn
yes
we'll close that
and then the dishwasher's ready to use the next time
what
you'd like to close it
oh yes
you can close the door
don't bang it too hard
just gently
that's it
little push now
well done
well done
well you open it by pressing this down
nothing
we've pots in
we haven't put any dishes in to wash „ have we
well I don't think we've really got enough to wash at the moment „ have we
we've only got a plate and a cup
that's not really worth it „ is it
we can start loading it up
of course we can
shall we load it with some things
I don't think you can reach on there
but look
empty the basket out and put
I don't think you can reach love
what you could do is pop the knife
the cutlery goes in that basket you see
and the plate there
oh look
there's some more
teaspoons
would you like to put the teaspoons in the basket
in this basket
this is called the cutlery basket
well I'll do that one because it's a sharp one
and we've another cup there
look
right
oh look
your special cup
I hadn't seen all these things on the draining board
two forks and a teaspoon
I'll let you put those in the cutlery basket if you like
that's it
yes
that's lovely
that's all there's to wash at the moment
would you like
now first of all before you close the door you've got to push this basket
you've got to slide it back
it's on rollers so it goes easily
that's it
now close the door and pop
well there's nothing the matter
we're not letting it run yet because there's not enough things to do a proper wash with
we'll wait until we've got more things and then we'll fill it up
and there's still some things we can't wash in the dishwasher
things like these glass
well that is an empty dishwasher powder
a bottle
do you know what's Mummy going to do with that
we've already rinsed it out
oh this isn't quite as easy as I thought
I was going to
can you smell that
smell that lemon smell
mm
it smells nice but again you mustn't touch it
we would rinse this out and I was going to try and take the top off and pour this salt into this container
because this container fits nicely in the cupboard
and I know that I can put salt in
but I can't get the lid off so I'll hafta forget that for the moment
perhaps we'll find something else to store it in
there
are we happy
no
the cupboard's not closing so we needta put the rinse aid back „ haven't we
the blue bottle needs to go back in there
and so does that
that's what we clean the garden furniture with when we finally get around to cleaning it
that's called Detox
you have seen Mummy use that
that's a fly swatter
when we've got flys buzzing around
do you remember
in the summer we useta get that out and go whoosh whoosh whoosh and get them „ didn't we
right
are you going to help Mummy load the washing machine now
no
oh TomTittlemouse come on
come on
because we needta do some washing „ don't we
you'd like to help me
right
you wanna help me wash up
well I'm not washing up at the moment Thomas
no
we wanna put all these things into this machine
you're going to help
no
well this is
look
these are the sheets off Mummy and Daddy's bed
they needta go into the washing machine
oh
it's the doorbell
let's go and see who's at the door
just a second
right
I can see what you've done
right
oh no don't
no
not on the floor
come on
into the washing machine please
Thomas
no
into the washing machine
they're your pyjamas
are you going to put them here
you're throwing on me
you've thrown them on your head „ haven't you
it's a silly
oh boo
I'm not surprised you can't see you sillybilly
you're throwing it on me
what is it
it's not a flannel
Thomas don't
you're going to hit something and then there'll be trouble „ won't there
no
we don't want those getting out
just put your sleep suit that you've thrown around in the washing machine
you know why we don't wanna put those in
because all the things we're putting in the machine now are nicely light „ aren't they
like white shirts and light colored things
the bag on the floor as got all dark things
and if we put them in here by mistake all Daddy's shirts will go blue and he won't be very happy „ will he
so there you are
pop it in please
and then we can shut the door
that's the empty washing basket
come on
in the machine
and then close the door please
are you
who came to see us
well she as just left Thomas
right
let's get to the table
your fire engine's here
yes
I know it's yours
well I'm putting it there because I think we oughta have a bite to eat now
well Rachel as gone and it's very late „ isn't it
it's time we had something to eat
so what were you saying to Rachel
you don't know
well she was talking about the fire the other night „ wasn't she
yes
a big crack
she said there's a big crack in the ceiling „ didn't she
yes
and she as got to have a new bathroom fitted „ hasn't she
and a new boiler
oh dear dear
what a mess
it is mended now yes
the fire's out
she as just still got some things to do in the house
no
no
your house hasn't got a crack
but then we haven't had a fire like Rachel „ have we
we can do without that „ can't we
oh
I didn't like that noise either Thomas
shut my ears
come on
let's wipe your hands on this towel and then we can have something to eat
can you not find your hands
I think I'll manage to find them
I think they're behind here
yes they are
look at that
what as all gone
oh the video
yes I know
we'll turn it off
well I've just turned this off
it as obviously finished „ hasn't it
we don't need it on anymore
would you like some Quavers Thomas
oh yes
I think the bin
there we are
which ones would you like
the pink or the green
the pink ones
I don't think you've had Quavers in a pink packet before „ have you
that's
that very exciting „ isn't it
well I'll open it for you
there we are
now would you like some cheese with those
some spaghetti
you're really not interested in eating „ are you
cheese
it's cheese
there you are
there's a plate
I'll put some cheese on that
you're eating them yourself
you're a clever boy „ aren't you
they taste good
we'll have a proper meal at teatime „ won't we
this is just a snack
a little snack
there you are
there's some crackers as well
cheese and biscuits
cheese and ham
and there's some fruit
would you like some fruit
some apple
no
oh I might have that instead
if you don't want it I might as well
oh no
don't sit on it Thomas
you might be hiding it but there's a banana in that box
if you sit on it you're going to go squish and squash all over your bottom
you'll look a real mess
yes
you'd like to do that „ wouldn't you
mhm

there you are
there's a hot cross bun there as well
it's too big
it's too big to go on the plate
but you don't hafta have it all on the plate „ do you
would you like some bread
yes
very true
it's cranberries
would you like some cranberries
it has got orange in it
yes
how do you know it as got orange in it
on the bottle
it's cran
oh I see

no
oh green

blue
orange
what are the bags from Sainsbury's
they're white with blue and orange „ aren't they
so is that what you're thinking of
the label there
you've got your Quavers stuck
I think you're probably trying to put too many in at once „ aren't you
I can hear a noise Thomas
oh it's the video rewinding
it worried me because I didn't know what it was
can you hear it now
there we are
sounds like it as finished now
you think so
no
well I think that click at the end means it as finished rewinding „ doesn't it

Quaver on it

I think you had cranberry jelly at Christmas because you thought it was like gel
do you remember that big Christmas dinner
and you had sausages „ didn't you
and mince pie too
yes
oh you like mince pies
I don't think we had mince pies on ChristmasDay
not Chirstmas lunchtime because we were so full „ weren't we
so I think you probably had sausages and all the vegetables and then you had a mince pie when we had Christmas puddings
I think the Christmas pudding was a bit too rich for you
but you like mince pies
we've still got some in the freezer
mhm
well perhaps this afternoon when you're having a drink
because you've got plenty of things on your plate at the moment „ haven't you
I wonder if you could buy mince pies in the shop all year round
because we bought some hot cross buns „ haven't we
and they're really meant for Easter
it is more like jam
yes
but once all the Christmas things were out of the shop at the baker's they started filling up with Easter things „ haven't they
no kicking please

and when Mummy was a little girl I remember once we were snowed in for days
and Granddad hadta walk about three miles to go and meet the postman to collect the post
and pick up some milk
and to go and do some shopping
and he hadta carry it all back in a bag because we couldn't get the car through
hadta walk across fields and all sorts that were covered in snow
