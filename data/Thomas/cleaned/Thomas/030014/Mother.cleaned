is it the dustbin men
are you going to look
oh
they're waving at you
that's nice „ isn't it
I don't think you needta bang on the window Tom because they know you're
know you're here already „ don't they
oh
then that was a nice day today for doing this „ have they
it as been raining
it was fine this morning when we got up
it's raining now
yes
he's gathering all the bags together and he's piling them up and he as put one quite high up on the top „ hasn't he
that's a white van
nothing to do with the dustbin men „ has it
the noise
is the noise of the dustbin men throwing down their bags
can you see them alright
the trouble is our trees have got quite tall now „ haven't they
our trees have got tall and we can't really see as well as we useta
they're at Sue's house now
it sounds to me as if the dustbin lorry is on it's way
I can hear a noise
we didn't know we were here
I just saw the man walking past the window
right
I think they're on their way now
they've delivered clean bags for next week
they've gathered up the rubbish and off they go
well
that's the clean dustbin bag for next week
the gentleman put it in the drain pipe „ didn't he
pardon
InceyWincey comes down there
InceyWinceySpider climbed up the spout down came the rain and washed the spider out
out came the dustbin men and dried up all the dustbins
I think it's sposta be out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
but InceyWinceySpider
climbed up the spout again
at least we saw them this week gathering the bags „ didn't we
the trouble is sometimes we can hear the dustbin lorry coming
so we're ready for them but we haven't heard it today
I can hear it now but we didn't hear it before the man came and there seems to be quite a long gap now between the dustbin men bringing the clean bag and stacking up the rubbish and the lorry coming „ doesn't there
hm
is that all you're going to say
hm
what you looking at darling
you're waiting for the dustbin man
dustbin lorry sorry
and holding Mummy's hair
oh no
you don't pull Mummy's hair
that's not nice „ is it
is it
can you see it

well why did you say it was
because you're a sillybilly that's why
can you see the blossom on that tree and the buds on this one
there's actual blossom on that one there
near Grant and Rachel's house
look
the blossom's out
oh
this sounds like the men now
they're buds on the tree near Rachel's house
we can just hear it „ can't we
oh
don't pick your nose Thomas
I'm coming
I'm not going anywhere
I'm just going to look out of the other window to see how the other man is
I'm watching out
I think he's probably at Steve's house now
he sounds quite close „ doesn't he
we had two bags of rubbish today
I didn't see where AuntieLinda and UncleBrian had put theirs out
Grant and Rachel had a lot „ didn't they
here he comes
he's coming
still can't see him „ can we
sounds like he's getting closer
do you know what we've got to do today
later on
I think it's time we took your birthday cards down
I was just thinking
it's a couple of weeks now since your birthday and normally only leave birthday cards up for a week
they are your special cards for your birthday
yes
yes
well we can look at that „ can't we
I think what we'll do then Thomas
when the dustbin men have been
I think we'll have a bite to eat love
we'll have something to eat
you're a pussy cat „ are you
I think Purdie's probably watching from upstairs in the bedroom „ don't you
and then after lunch if it fairs up we'll go for a walk to the shop
ah
what's that
that's not the dustbin man wagon
it's a van with a trailer on the back
no
don't climb any higher Thomas please
we'll make sure you can see the men when they come
now as I was standing here I was just thinking a couple of weeks ago it was your birthday and on that day you were having your lunch „ weren't you
and we suddenly realized the men were there and we quickly undid the straps of your chair and rushed you to the window so you could see them
we've kept your cards and balloons up because last week JakeJimmy
no
it's a week before JakeJimmy came
and last Thursday
you want me to stroke the pussy cat
okay
last Thursday Jake and Georgia came for a little party
so now I think most of your friends have been we should take the cards and balloons down „ don't you
you don't wanna
no
well I think they could do with coming down
you normally only leave them up for a week Thomas
we left them up a bit longer because we knew some people were coming
listen
we've got to go out later „ haven't we
to the chemist and to the shop
are you saying meow or now or no
did you say more polos
oh
polos in the green shop
no
we're not going for polos Thomas
and we've got to go out later and buy something like a cake
no
you're obsessed with sweets
because listen
tomorrow
Tuesday
Dimitra and Jeannine are coming
do you not remember Jeannine
you do remember Jeannine
but listen
it's Dimitra's last time ever for coming here to do a video
Dimitra came to your party
you bounced on her
yes
poor Dimitra
she came to see you on your birthday and you bounced up and down on her
poor lady
it's a wonder she ever came back
but it's Dimitra's birthday at the end of the month
did she give you some chocolate lolly pops
that's very nice
and what else
and some small chocolates which we just happen to need this very minute cause you remembered about them
oh excuse me
no
I think the men when we hear them they must be coming to the top of the road and they must go right down to the bottom end of Streetname Drive and pick up the bags there because we always seem to be waiting a long long time for them to come „ don't we
and Dimitra's birthday is at the end of April and we hafta buy her a card and a present and we're going to go out for a meal with her „ aren't we
don't do that Thomas please
we're going to go to the GreenForestCafe
do you remember going there with Daddy
Mummy and Daddy took you last year
there are elephants and all sorts of animals in the room
they go raa
where's the jungle
it's a cafe in the jungle „ isn't it
do you remember going at the TraffordCentre
well
we're going to go there with Dimitra
oh
sounds like the men are coming
as a joint sort of leaving present and birthday present
but I think tomorrow we'll get a cake so that we can have a little party here
oh
here they are
are you going to wave to the men
that's right
I think the men that waved at you already are the men we know very well „ aren't they
keep waving cause he might glance up
there
he as seen you and he's waving back
that's nice „ isn't it
he's still waving
isn't that lovely
yes
oops
off he goes
right
this is our rubbish now going in the back
can you see alright there
look
look
rubbish
our rubbish
he threw that box in „ didn't he
did you not see the box
there
our rubbish has gone for another week
shall we move your chair so you can see what's happening there
he's running
he got out of his cab and he ran „ didn't he
oh
the other man's waving at you now
that's right
isn't this lovely the way when
oh

we nearly lost you then „ didn't we
they're bound to look again before driving off „ aren't they
there we are
isn't that lovely
right
rubbish now from near Sue's house
can you see
do you know there's far more rubbish
at Sue's house
where as it all come from
well
it as come from everybody's house
oh
here's the man now
I was just about to say the driver got out of his cab and ran to help the driver collect our rubbish and there was hardly anything and yet he as left the poor man to deal with all the bags at the other side of the road and I think he was running out of his cab
right
one last wave and that's it
I think he was running out of his cab to tell the other man that you were waving and they hadta wave
right
off they go
isn't that lovely
because I was about to say to you that I think the men that collect the bags
and leave new bags are the men that we know cause they've been coming for a long long time but it looks now as if the new men who are driving
there were six men today
did you see that
there were three men collecting bags and
and delivering new bags
there was a driver and there were two other men picking up rubbish for them
pardon
pardon
who didn't spin round
did you not spin round
listen darling
we should've done something today really because it's easter at the end of the week but the bin men usually come on a BankHoliday
the next Monday will be BankHolidayMonday and you'll have had easter eggs on Sunday
so how about if I
don't take anymore out now
no
how about next week Thomas
we get some of those little easter eggs for the dustbin men
would you like that
I don't know
big lorry
big lorry with two wheels
I don't know which lorry you mean
you mean the train
you've lost me
I don't know what you're talking about
oh
your bicycle
it's there Thomas
that great big bicycle about two inches from your nose

I didn't know that's what you meant
I should have realized that's what you meant by your lorry
it's just that because that was two inches from your nose and you didn't mention it I assumed that wasn't what you wanted
the fruit lorry is here
hello fruit lorry
you're usually a dustbin man „ aren't you
after the dustbin men have been
hm
you're a fruit lorry man instead „ are you
so I think next Monday Thomas
if we go to the shop
the wheel as not run them over
yes
we'll go and buy some eggs and next Monday when the men are here
the bin men
shall we go outside
and hand them a little bag with enough eggs
there are six dustbin men
if we give them half a dozen eggs
yes
but when they stop for their cup of tea or coffee they might enjoy an egg „ mightn't they
would you like to do that
right
we'll do that then
share
that's right
you can share some eggs
chocolate eggs and we must get some cakes for tomorrow afternoon because we've got to say goodbye to Dimitra
yes
the dustbin man was spinning round
we've got to say goodbye to Dimitra but also we've got to
oh right
listen we needta welcome Jeannine properly „ don't we
it as gone away now darling
are you ready now for something to eat now we've had the excitement of the dustbin men
no
the spinning round and round thing
well
I've put it away in the kitchen darling
would you like to come with me to get the dustbin bag

quicketyquicky
isn't that lovely
did you get wet on your head
thank you
right
we've got it in now
we won't put it in the dustbin because the dustbin's outside at the back and that would mean going out in the rain
it's just it's quite windy today and I have a feeling that if we left it outside it would blow away
there we are
there's lotsof bottles
what are you
a dustbin man or a fruit man
a fruit man
right
okay
I was waiting for the fruit man and here he came
yes

you're putting them on the floor gently
well look

would you like to put them on the box

there's lotsof rubbish waiting to be collected „ isn't there

waiting to be collected on the side of the road
on Friday we saw the dustbin men in Didsbury „ didn't we
big red lorry in Didsbury „ that's right
what happened
we were trying to get past „ weren't we
and we couldn't because they were blocking the road
oh dear

don't take the tops off now
you've got a problem
okay
oh look
Purdie's coming downstairs now
I hurt your toe
oh
did I push the chair
oh sorry sweetheart
I didn't realize your foot was there
I'll just move the chair out of the way
so Purdie can get past
very sorry Thomas
I didn't see your foot
it was an accident
what did you see some boys doing

they were blocking the path „ were they

oh well
Purdie as just run outside this very minute
she as just nipped outside
can you see
alright
well I'm sure she'll come in in a minute cause it's raining
and she's
and she doesn't like the rain
no
she's not really scared
she just doesn't really like it
it's not very comfortable „ is it
tell you what Thomas
Purdie seems to like her new bed „ doesn't she
remember the bed we bought her
we didn't think she was going to like it at first „ did we
be careful dragging those bottles
it's very nice of the men to wave to you though „ isn't it
they were all waving
I think it's lovely
they obviously know where you live now
I think that Ben waves at them as well
Ben's Mummy told me that Ben gets very excited when the dustbin men come
pardon
are you saying something about Ben
what are you saying about Ben
something about a telephone
thank you
thank you very much
oh that's lovely
yes
that's handy
that's a nice box „ isn't it
thank you
you're stacking them in the box
that's lovely
thank you

it is a very heavy bag
thank you so much

all over the floor „ aren't they
will you help pick them up and when you pick them up pop them straight into Purdie's plate like that
that's it
good boy
thank you
you're a good little helper „ aren't you

Purdie

that's right

have you hurt the muscles in between your legs
oh sweetheart
listen
when Mummy was a little girl
when I was your age
I was three but I was a little bit older than you are now
Grandma bought Mummy two little skirts from Marks and Spencers
they were kilts
pleated kilts
like you

you're not wearing a kilt

you're wearing tartan trousers but they're not a kilt
no
Isobel has a kilt

well Mummy
Grandma

Grandma bought Mummy two skirts a red one
no
and a
a red one and a
no
not blue
no
no
green
and Grandma said try these skirts on because if they don't fit we'll hafta take them back to the shop
and I tried them on and as I was stepping out of one of them my legs went yip and I did the splits and broke my leg and I was in hospital for six weeks with my leg up
I did
I didn't have an ambulance
no
although possibly yes
I did have an ambulance but it didn't have a siren
I can't remember
I was too little
I did have bandages
huge bandage round my leg and she had her leg up like that in hospital
oh
oh dear dear
and you want a plaster on your bottom and you want the fire engine to do it
well let's open these cause I think you've just hurt yourself „ haven't you
what's this smell
it smells of orange juice
well it's called citrus
let's have a look
we've got to put some

just smell that
it smells like orange juice you said
what did I say yesterday
it does smell like sweets
but what did I say
jelly
do you remember I got in the car and I said to Daddy I can smell jelly

and Daddy said oh you are silly
no
he didn't say that
there's some yellow ribbon there
look at that
that's rather nice
you open this first
no
darling we'll need this
look at those funny shapes

if I hand you those would you like to put them into the jar
into that jar
oops

might hafta wash our hands after this
it's a bit
yes please
yes
everything
that's right
we take it from the bag
and we put it in this jar
this is to make Mummy and Daddy's bedroom smell nice
look at this
it looks like a big orange
that's too large to go in the jar
we'll keep that for something else
oh
there's another little ball there
that's it
yes please
oh
that's a nice one
look
that's unusual „ isn't it
it's more like a fish
yes
it looks like a fish
it's a cross between a fish and a cone „ isn't it
unless you can put those in
it smells very nice „ doesn't it
mhm
delicious
there's another of those little things
they're very strange „ aren't they
hm

no
you mustn't play with it
it's not a toy darling
no
now look
I don't know what those are
look rather nice „ don't they
do they smell nice as well
smell like traffic cones

hm

right
I don't think we need much more now cause it's fairly full that jar „ isn't it
looks like a big spider
now I think we'll just top up now with just these small
I tell you what I'll give you those to just slot in sweetheart
please
look
there's something there that looks like a little
oh
I've lost it
I've seen a little caterpillar

right
that's one jar

right
we've got another little jar to fill
think those little balls would go in there
is there enough room
is there enough room for that or not
not
okay
we'll hafta fill up with these orange things I think cause they're quite small „ aren't they
I don't think the balls will go in darling
I think we'll hafta leave those with these oranges
I think that's all too much „ isn't it
shall we leave that out and put some smaller things in
you're talking about no more sweets no more liquorice
this is something you've seen on
is it TheTweenies
skateboard
oh
I know what it is

and does SkateboardSam try and get the naughty boy for stealing sweets
fire engine
am I doing this on my own now
thank you
well we'll put these two jars in Mummy and Daddy's bedroom and I think for the rest we've got a nice wooden bowl which we might put on the hearth down here „ do you think
that'd be rather nice „ wouldn't it
on the mantelpiece
I don't think there's room on the mantelpiece
well
there would be if we took down your birthday cards
no
oh Thomas we really needta take them down now
what's not fair
but they've been up two weeks

do you not think it's time they came down
no
at breakfast time
well
if we're not going to take the cards down can we not take down the PinTheTailOnTheDonkey or PinTheTailOnTheEeyore
can we do that do you think
should we put that ribbon round there
it's more like a funny snake
what color is the ribbon
when Mummy was a little girl you know the teddy bear that sits on your bed that you and Daddy laugh at cause it's so scruffy because it's as old as me
well
it isn't actually
it's younger than me cause I got it for my fifth birthday
when that came from the shop new for my birthday
it had a ribbon on it's neck the same color as this
only it was slightly wider I think
there
do you know what that is Thomas
it's a parcel
I've just tied a bow
it doesn't actually look very nice now „ does it

right
there we are
I'm quite pleased with that

absolutely soaking wet
right

we can keep it
