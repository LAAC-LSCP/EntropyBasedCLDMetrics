I'm just going to this now whilst we turn the microwave on to melt the chocolate
well done
I'll just take the bowl out of the microwave
look at this now
that's chocolate all melted
all that chocolate as been heated up
would you like to stir

that's right and pouring it in to that bowl
and then we're going to tip the Cornflakes in

crunching them up
is Thomas making a mess

I think you are
I think so
doesn't matter „ does it
Mummy is going to just scrape this last little bit up
there we are
can you see it all
melted chocolate
I can hear the little boy next door hammering
what's he doing
this is chocolate
there we are
let's mix it a little bit more
and then we're going to put it into some little paper cases
this is more fun than PlayDoh Thomas because we get very dirty and you can lick your fingers afterwards

you dirty
the chocolate's not dirty „ is it
I think we've mixed it enough now
shall we pop these little cases
in some buntins
would you like to do that
some are plain white and some have flowers on them

it's nice to have somebody to help
would you like some small spoons like Mummy
I think you could manage to make a bit better
what are these
two spoons
these are teaspoons
we mix the chocolate with a wooden spoon

two spoons
Thomas has two spoons
and Mummy has two spoons
that's lovely
and when we've finished putting this into the cases we're going to put the mini Easter egg
perhaps even two

that's right pop it into the paper case

that's right
you're not saying very much
is it exciting helping to cook
which of the cases have flowers on them
go on do you wanna put it back in the big bowl
no not the ones with
these ones

you can see straight through it
if I look here I can see Thomas with his two spoons
take your mixture out of the bowl
and put it into the paper cases
oh dear dear
never mind it as gone on the floor
we can soon clear it up „ can't we
I think we've nearly finished now
that's the cornflake
