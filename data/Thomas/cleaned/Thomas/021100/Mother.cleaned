you've been a clever boy „ haven't you
using your potty

just stand on this little stool
that's a good boy
right
wash your hands

lots and lotsof water
there we are
oh no
there's no fishes in
what do you mean
a pond
or the fish tank
lots and lotsof huge fish
and sharks
dry your hands
you're talking about AuntyFranks
that's your two fish
you sound like you're talking about meat and vegetables
are you talking about the fish we eat rather than the fish that are swimming around
that's a nice word
four fish
lotsof fish
now let's pull your trousers up
loads and loads of fish
right
let's pull your trousers up
pull your trousers up because you've just been a good boy
what have you just done
you've done a wee wee on your potty „ haven't you
no
you didn't do a poo
it doesn't matter
you've been very clever
so you've washed your hands
let's pull your trousers up and put your slippers on
you've just seen Dipsy
yes
it's a picture of the Teletubbies „ isn't it
well I'll get it for you in a minute
no
it's not dinner time
but see as you've been a good boy
would you like
would you like a little treat
for being
what toys
well the toys on the worktop they're not really toys Thomas
I'm cleaning the WelshDresser
I'm washing all the pots
I've got to do some repairs on something
you needta play with them
you can have a look at this
this is a kaleidoscope
right
do you know what you do with a kaleidoscope
do you
you look through that hole there
point it towards the light
and turn it round and round and you'll see lotsof different shapes
just let me see it's not too dark that way
I'll turn your chair round so you're facing the light
because it's better to shine it at the light
right
you look at that with one eye
one eye
no
you're putting it on your nose darling
just one eye
what can you see down there
what can you see
no
turn it round and round like this
I'll hold it
you just look through there
I'll hold it and you just look
don't move your head
just look
what can you see
pardon
beads
that's right
you do it
now twirl it round and round
like that
but not on your nose
in front of your eye
no
not on your eye Thomas
just look through that
not too close
look with one eye
just one eye
just look with one eye and turn it round and round
but point it towards the light and then you will see all the pretty patterns „ won't you
what colors can you see
nothing
well what are you doing with it
right
you look through there
what can you see
beads
you must be able to see because you're saying beads
are they pretty
pretty beads „ aren't they
you can see a daffodil
oh yes
that's a lovely daffodil „ isn't it
that's funny
right
for being a good boy would you like some jelly babies
I know you like jelly babies
it's a little treat to have some though „ isn't it
but then you've been a good boy using your potty „ haven't you
so when you're a good boy you get a reward
let's just give you a green one
you haven't got a green one
how's that
black yellow orange red and green
I'll move you back this way now
I was going to get the glue out because
when I've been washing the pots from the WelshDresser
I've taken down the coffee pot and inside of the coffee pot is this
and it's the lid of the coffee pot
and I remember now that a long time ago we broke the lid and we didn't bother sticking it together
but I've just found it now so
it's like doing a jigsaw Thomas
we're going to hafta try and find out where all the little pieces go
it's more like a sausage
so it might take me a few minutes to do it
and I've got to be very careful I don't get my fingers glued together
that wouldn't be any good „ would it
oh now that piece goes there
it's very sticky
what happened I was watching AuntyMabel the other day
at least you were watching AuntyMabel and I glanced at it
well what was the one about the tea pot
what had happened
oh dear
the glue as snapped
the lid of the glue as snapped
Pippin broke a new tea pot „ did he
well I think
was the tea pot not a birthday present to AuntyMabel from her nephew
and the nephew was coming for a cup of tea „ wasn't he
and Pippin
I don't know what happened but somehow when AuntyMabel was undoing all her birthday presents Pippin got in the way
and the tea pot was knocked over and smashed
and she desperately needed to get one just the same before her nephew came „ didn't she
pardon
who's a silly woman
why
nephew
well you're a nephew
you're UncleDavid's nephew and AuntyPatty's nephew
I don't know whether this is going to stick Thomas
you think so not
I don't think it is actually
have they got some buttons
so AuntyMabel
we're going back to this AuntyMabel story now
she wanted to buy a new teapot so that her nephew wouldn't know that she had broken it
she went to the shop and they hadn't got any in „ had they
they ad none left
and the lady said I can order one and AuntyMabel said
that's no good
I've got to have one this afternoon
where did you get yours from
she said
we get ours from the factory
so what was the next thing that AuntyMabel and Pippin did
where did they go
they went to the factory „ didn't they
to see teapots being made
and cups and sugars
were they making cups and sugar basins at the same time
Thomas that isn't nice
in fact
have they
I was just about to say I'll take the jelly babies off you for saying silly woman but you've eaten them „ haven't you
well I don't think there'll be anymore if you say that again
it's not nice „ is it
it's not a nice thing to say Thomas
and this isn't sticking „ is it
the nozzle of the glue tube snapped „ didn't it
just as we started
oh no
perhaps we just needta leave it a long time
right now
we've got this
what is this
it's a little crystal bunny rabbit
yes
you hold him very carefully
oh it as got a tummy
it as got a big tummy
it's an ear
he hasn't got one of his ears
it as fallen off
I don't know why
pardon
no
you haven't broken it
Isabel
no
Isabel didn't break it either Thomas
I think it was something that got broken when we moved house
and I put it somewhere safe
and I've just found it
so I'm going to glue an ear back on to the bunny rabbit
it's only a tiny thing
we can't really see because there's no sunshine today
but these figures Thomas
if you hold them up to the light
if you shine a light on it and put it in the sunshine all the pretty colors come through
you can't really see today because there isn't enough sun
right
I'll just have a look to see which way the ear needs to go
where does the ear needta go
on there
right
I'll try and put it back again
I'll try
try not to not break it
it think it goes that way
right
there we are
oh dear Dora
Pippin lost his suitcase
you're talking about another episode of AuntyMabel and Pippin „ aren't you
and that's the one where
yes
AuntyMabel and Pippin had been to stay with a friend called Dora and Pippin brought his suitcase
and AuntyMabel wrote when they got home
thank you Dora
for a nice time
but unfortunately Pippin as lost his suitcase
can you send it to us
PostmanPat came with Pippin's suitcase
but I think that episode showed you what happens to all the post „ doesn't it
it showed you the letter that AuntyMabel and Pippin had written going
on a railway train
that's right
they posted it in a postbox
and we saw the postman come in his van and empty the letterbox
and put the letter in his sack
and then he drove off
and it went to a sorting office „ didn't it
do you remember those big machines
that's right
and take all the letters away
and then after they had been sorted they went into bags
and they went to the railway station „ didn't they
they went on the RoyalMail train „ didn't they
and then what happened
they were sorted again „ weren't they
and then the postman delivered it
look
the bunny rabbit's ear's better
can you see
it doesn't look quite in the same place as the other one but I'm sure it is
we needta wait for the glue to dry now
there
how's that
a little toy's behind my back
behind my bottom
oh yes
we've something else to mend „ haven't we
and that is one of your toys
right
yes
it's this little church
look
it's one of your bits from the wooden train set
we've had two accidents with that so far „ haven't we
Daddy trod on
one of the little carriages
the little yellow carriage
and then
not again
yes
and then this little
I'm not sure whether that's a church or a school Thomas
what do you think it is
it's a church „ is it
well whatever it is the clock came off a little while ago
and now the spire has come off
that's why I think it might be a little church
so we've already mended that once „ haven't we
we've repaired it once before
you needta have a go
well I wish somebody could have a go but
ah that's where it goes to I suppose
that way
right
we know now „ don't we
there
there's something else
we've got to just hold a few moments until the glue sets
that's good „ isn't it
and then it'll all fit back together again like that „ won't it
no ReverendTimms in that church
no
I don't think there is „ is there
there
it all fits back like that Thomas
we've finally got it done „ haven't we
now I'll hafta be very careful now with this glue
because we need a lot of glue
a lot of glue everywhere
well we'll try not to get it everywhere
ah
where's the church
now I'll stick that on
it's over here
did you throw it
right
now we need
this is the final piece of the jigsaw
Thomas that's not nice
you've just said pick your nose lick it and put it on the table
now who an earth has said that to you
an awful thing to say
do you know what I think as well
I think the glue's empty
the tube of glue is almost empty before
oh I see what you're doing
you're picking your nose with the spire
still it isn't pleasant Thomas „ is it
it's really not nice at all
now what do you think to that
what does Thomas think to that
it is brilliant „ isn't it
it's more like a what now
a moon
oh
it was a bit
gosh it's making my eyes sting
it was more like a moon when it was broken
it looked like half a moon „ didn't it
a chocolate star
oh what a shame
we've run out of glue
look
before we've got the church done
perhaps that's why the container because it it as been used such a lot
it must have thought I'm fed up of being used
I'll hafta buy a new tube
you think so
you think you'll have a blue one
a blue what
oh right
ah I see what you mean
do you wanna hold that
that's the empty packet that the glue came in
I can't give you the actual container
that would be silly „ wouldn't it
but I can give you the packet
right
look at that Thomas
I've stuck the lid back together
isn't that clever
what do you think to that
have you still got the steeple
where is it darling
oh right
we'll just see
I don't think there's enough glue but we'll just try our very best
we put a little too much glue on this head now it's running down the side
that's it
if we rub that on there
oh there Thomas
what do you think to that
you've broken that
that doesn't matter
that's the empty packet the glue came in
look
it's stuck together straight away
there you are
that's quite alright
and that's the lid of the coffee pot
oops

which we've just dropped again but luckily it didn't break
isn't that lovely
now we better leave all those things to try
that's three things we've stuck together
you need the toy behind me
right
I'll just have a look and see what
an orange toy
oh that's a balloon Thomas
you saw the balloon „ did you
I've got a feeling that was possibly in one of the flower vases on the WelshDresser


have you managed to blow it up
oh you've got to be very careful blowing balloons up you don't hurt yourself
we've got some of the glue on the table „ haven't we
that's right
it scrapes off
but when it's dry it isn't sticky anymore
it's just hard „ isn't it
oh that's good
that's very clever Thomas
you're managing to blow it quite a
do you
you've got a yellow one white one and a green one
the yellow one and the white one are long like sausages
but the orange and green one are ordinary balloons „ aren't they
ordinary shapes
a balloon shape
it's only I'm scrubbing that and it's making a noise but we needta get it off the table „ don't we
there we are
how's that
I'm very pleased with that
I think we've done a good job there Thomas
no
they're not broken
there we are
green orange blue
there we are
would you like to blow the balloon now
they're nice colors these „ aren't they
it as gone down the floor in the water
I don't think there's any water
I can't blow up the yellow and white ones Thomas
they're too
oh is it
you're pretending the carpet as got water on it
is it a pond or a stream or a river
a river
oh I see
so the balloons could be fish „ couldn't they
in the river
oh that tastes absolutely horrible
I'm not blowing that
no
I can never do these
no
I'm sorry
I can't taste that
I'm not doing that one because it tastes terrible
I didn't like it at all
ugh

no
I can't do it Thomas
I need the balloon pump
I don't know what it is about those long sausage shaped balloons but you need lotsof breath to blow them up
and I never seem to manage it
so are those fish in the sea
there we are
that little rabbit's
it's a crane on the water „ is it
do you mean a crane like a duck crane or do you mean a crane like in a building site
the building site one
the building site crane
right
what are you going to do now
well I think you wanted to look at this „ didn't you
when we sat down before
I'll just make sure the table's dry after that
before we spread this out
oh what's this
oh it it as got wet Thomas
oh it as got wet
how as it got wet
oh it's spoilt now „ isn't it
yes
it's spoilt
I don't know how that as got water on it
never mind
now look
they're wet on the tummys
it's the Teletubbies „ isn't it
if we just leave it flat Thomas
when it dries out I'm sure we still use it
just look at it
now it's wet it's so fragile
who can you see
yes
that's right
TinkyWinky Dipsy LaLa and
now what are they all standing on

I'll hafta go and get changed „ won't I
perhaps I could sit in front of a nice warm fire while I dry out and warm up
better not get too close to the fire though
otherwise
yes
you will
you'll hafta take me away because the new clean dry jumper would be going up in smoke as well
fire
help
we'll hafta be careful when we're shouting that Thomas
because AuntyLinda next door might think one day that we're on fire and she might come running round with a hosepipe full of water
and she might squirt us
you mustn't shout fire help too loudly „ must you
again
where's the hose
back in the fire engine
whereabouts
I can't see it
oh Thomas that's clever
you've put it on the top there
good
well nice to know you're so well prepared sweetheart
what are you saying
who's stuck Thomas
you don't know who's stuck
Pippin's stuck
I don't think
I don't think Pippin's likely to get stuck up a tree
you're getting the ladders out of the fire engine now „ aren't you
you're raising them
I think it's more likely to be stuck up a tree and needing the services of the fireman
ah here you are Pippin
you're safe now
that's kind
you're a good boy Thomas
rescuing people „ aren't you
a good fireman
is it
what's on fire now
ReverendTimms is on fire
from the PostmanPat storys
goodness me
how did ReverendTimms come to be on fire
no
I don't
oh look
Felix is here outside
UncleBrian's pussy cat Felix has come to see us
shh Thomas
not so loud
that's very loud darling „ isn't it
your siren's very loud
what's that
oh I see
it's not an ambulance
it's a fire engine
well that's the thing Thomas
sometimes you can hear these sirens and you don't know what it is „ do you
so at least I know now because you've told me
I'm glad you told me
am I
oh dear
you're squirting me with water
oh I bet you're enjoying that „ aren't you

are you enjoying drenching Mummy with water
I bet it's cold water as well „ isn't it
ah
I need a bonfire
