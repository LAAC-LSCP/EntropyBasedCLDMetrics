the red cabbage
are you going to have some more sausage roll Thomas
what about the driver and the horse
would they like some
get out driver
shut the cab
the horse is jumping too
the horse is galloping
can the horse not reach the sausage roll
well perhaps I'll turn the plate round
can the horse reach now
I think when we've had our sausage roll we might ice some little biscuits to have as a dessert
what do you think
does that sound like a good idea
open the cab
for the driver to get in

are you just going to have a little bit more to eat Thomas
who can eat it
choochootank eat it
you mean the train driver or the train
the train
I don't think trains eat the food that we eat Thomas
what do horses eat
horses eat hay „ don't they
is it galloping
there's some apple there as well in the middle of the table on the bowl
on the plate rather
can you reach the apple
no
mm that tastes nice
steady
the driver's on the platform
I think he's going to have a cup of coffee
would he like to share my coffee
mm
oh lovely
he's enjoying a warm drink „ isn't he
enjoyed it
yes
that's right
the horse drink it
do you think the horse would like some coffee or it might prefer some water
do you think the horse would prefer water
yes
the horse eats hay and drinks water
it's the engine driver that perhaps he'd like a sausage roll and a sandwich
and he might like to share your apple and have a cup of coffee
the horse might like the apple
hm
horses eat apples
did he enjoy that
he's eating crisps
do you think the horse would like some crisps as well
mm nice
the driver's back on the platform
I think the driver better get back in his train and go off you know
it's going to be late
let's look at Mummy's watch
what time is it
it's what time
eight o'clock
no
it's five to one
it's nearly one o'clock
the train's due at one
it's almost one o'clock
that's right
put the horse in the trailer
and they better go quickly „ hadn't they
otherwise they're going to be late
and we don't want them late „ do we
is he driving off now
Mummy as got very sticky hands now
would you like some of this Thomas
would you like some of that
and where's the train going to now he as driven off
to Manchester
mhm
whereabouts is he going to in Manchester because he as got a horse in the back
got a horse on it
where do you think he's going
to Manchester
do you think the horse is perhaps a police horse and the police man's going to ride it through the streets of Manchester
it as come back again
because police men do ride horses in Manchester „ don't they
we've seen them
police horses
pardon
look Mummy
yes
that's clever „ isn't it
the train's now pulling a trailer with a horse in the back and two cars
one of them a racing car
and they've all clipped together „ haven't they
I think you said look Mummy „ didn't you
look Mummy
mm
that's a very big load
it's a long train „ isn't it
pop
are you pulling them apart
it looks to me now as if the racing car is pulling the train
hiding
not fall down
is that better
do you think it's time for the horse to have something else to drink
would you like to fetch a bucket of water
bucket of water
you sound snuffly Thomas
have you got a cold
pardon
no drink
does the horse not want a drink
or could you not find a drink
you couldn't find a drink to give the horse
oh dear dear
I hope he's not thirsty
when you want a drink you're thirsty
when you want something to eat you're hungry
you often tell me you're not hungry or you're hungry but you don't often say thirsty „ do you
is Thomas thirsty
pardon
together
together
two together
not fall off the table
the little pieces off
carrying the pieces
did you say carried pieces or carrying the pieces
carry the piece
are you putting them back together again now
you look to me as if you are
well that's a funny thing Thomas
you've put the engine driver and the cab and the train funnel all on top of the racing car
it must be jolly strong racing car „ mustn't it
weewee
is that the noise it's making wee
is that the noise as it's setting off
have you had enough of this Thomas
you don't want anymore
are you sure
you're not sure or you mean yes you've had enough
you've had enough
and would you like a drink now
no
I think you're too engrossed in playing with the trains „ aren't you
to be bothered about eating
blackcurrant
that's right
oh all done now
shops for some more
yes
we don't seem to have a lot of blackcurrant left in the bottle „ do we
there's a little drop there
well tomorrow if we don't go to the shops later today
tomorrow when Grandma and Granddad come and they ask of we need anything from the shops because they usually do we'll say yes please a bottle of blackcurrant juice for Thomas
how about that
and what do you say
yes please
what do you say now that I've just given you some blackcurrant
thanks
that's alright
right
I shall tidy those things away
and I'll put the apple in a bowl because I think you might eat that later
I needta buy some more fruit from the shop as well Thomas
we haven't got many apples or bananas „ have we
no
no
no pears
there are a few apples but not very many
and we've got two bananas
that's all we've got
two bananas
that's not going to keep us going very long „ is it
there we are
I'll pop the bowl of apples there and then if you decide to eat some more later you know where it is
Mummy as got some vegetables to peel
while you're playing with your train „ shall I do that
no
you don't want me to peel any vegetables
oh
big bears eat it
did you say something about Isabel
Isabel and DaddyRod eat it
DaddyRod's hungry „ is he
are you asking me what we make
oh this is something that you learnt at bangadrumtime „ isn't it
and you say what shall we make
and I will say strawberry milkshake
shake
hold the carrots
well I think we better peel them first Thomas
I'm just looking for the peeling machine
not the peeling machine
I mean the little potato peeler
a potato peeler
not bite
they are dirty carrots „ aren't they
now I'm going to peel them and then we'll wash them
and then perhaps slice them or something
there
can you see that
just take the knife
it's a potato peeler but it's another very sharp knife Thomas
so you've not to play with it
but look
can you see I'm just taking a tiny layer of skin off there
the skin or the peel
it's alright
it's just a little piece of skin that as come off onto the chopping board
they look nice and clean now „ don't they
they still need a good wash though
do you remember seeing the episode of AuntyMabel and Pippin when she went to help at a school in the kitchens
it showed her farm where carrots were grown and how they were harvested
and packed and sent to the shops
in a big lorry
and somebody was
another lorry
and somebody at the school was poorly
somebody who worked in the school canteen
and AuntyMabel went to help „ didn't she
at lunchtime
she helped prepare lunch and they were having carrots
and AuntyMabel stood and peeled and chopped a lot of carrots
and Pippin wasn't allowed in the kitchen „ was he
dogs aren't allowed in kitchens
so Pippin hadta stay outside but it just so happened that when they arrived it was playtime
and the children were all playing outside
riding round on tricycles and playing on bicycles and things
and Pippin had a fantastic time „ didn't he
while AuntyMabel was busy
and then AuntyMabel went home and as if she hadn't had enough of doing it all day she peeled and chopped some carrots for her own tea „ didn't she
again
you want the story again
I'm sure you can watch it on telly darling
but you remember that one „ don't you
about carrots
what color are carrots
pink
orange
rabbits like to eat carrots
and donkeys like carrots
and I like carrots when they're raw
you can crunch them like an apple
you don't seem to keen „ do you
you can bite it certainly
just let me finish peeling this one and then I'll wash you a piece
they're very good for you
when you were teething you useta like chewing on raw carrot because they're nice and crunchy especially if they've been in the fridge they were cold and nice to bite on
ease those poor sore gums
you were always poorly when you were teething „ weren't you
yes
this is a very dirty carrot „ isn't it
I'm actually peeling them now because we've got an awful lot and I'm frightened that they're going to go bad before I get a chance to use them
hm
nearly done
so these carrots in this bag
I'm going to peel and wash and slice
and then I shall put them in the freezer so that when we want some carrots perhaps for a chicken casserole or something like that we can get them straight out of the freezer and pop them in the pot
do you like helping Mummy in the kitchen
no
you do
you're never out of the kitchen when I'm there
last one
how many carrots have we got Thomas
one two three seven eight
no
start again
how many carrots have we got

after all that we got four
you clever boy
you counted then up till twelve „ didn't you
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and then it sounded as if you went straight to fourteen without going to thirteen but nevertheless that was quite impressive Thomas
and then at the end of it we end of it we ended up with four carrots when in actual fact we've got one two three four five
we've only got five carrots
the carrots together
Mummy just needs to put that in the compost bin now „ doesn't she
so I'll put it back in the bag and then we can have a trip outside in a moment
back a moment Mummy
no
I'm not going to take them now
I'll stay in here with you
I'm going to wash them now
just cleaning the chopping board
I'm just going to give the carrots a quick rinse and chop them up
taste one
wow
you're getting very excited about some carrots „ aren't you
there we are
small piece for Thomas
Mummy will eat some as well
let's see if they're crunchy
watch your teeth
oh mm
very nice
not Thomas crunch
I'm cutting these into rounds Thomas
into circles
look
you can cut carrots into strips
batons
or you can leave then whole
bit these are a little bit too large „ aren't they
to leave whole
not like it now
no
I didn't think you did the last time you tried it
but as I say when you were teething
two pieces
well you hold two pieces
when you were a baby you really useta enjoy eating raw carrot
when you were teething not when you were a baby
when you were a baby you useta like carrots cooked and pureed with some stewed stewed apple
carrot and apple mixed together
you wanna hold two more
throw them out
oh you're putting them in the back of the train now „ are you
just let Mummy slice that one
you've not got to get your fingers in the way of this sharp knife „ have you
sharp knife
another one
I think I might hafta give them another rinse Thomas
if you're going to put them in your trailer
you shouldn't really fruit and vegetables too much because a lot of the vitamins the goodness comes out
are you tipping the trailer up with all the carrots in
well that's going to make a noise „ isn't it
how many pieces of carrot are you putting in the racing car
one two three
empty it all out now
is that what you said empty it all out
now we can put them into this bright red colander
this is like a plastic pan with holes in the bottom „ isn't it
what's it called
it's called red
well it is red
yes
it's called a colander
a colander
and we have a metal sieve that has many more holes but the holes are much finer
and we use the sieve when we're sieving flour „ don't we
putting them in the trailer
but the colander is used more for washing fruit and vegetables „ isn't it
or straining things
and then we have another strainer which is like a very big sieve that Mummy uses when we're straining rice
when we've cooked rice
you still say wodar and woder „ don't you
when you want something
yes
like when you were a baby
wodar
mm
I'm still crunching on raw carrot Thomas
mhm
one of the little carrots has fallen in Mummy's shoe
I don't think we better put that one in the pan „ do you
I don't think anyone would fancy it once it had been in my shoe
oh no
don't empty them all out in the table Thomas
we're going to wash them now and put them into to a pot ready for the freezer
are you going to help me do that
no
oh poor Mummy
oh good boy
you're putting them back
oh listen Thomas
you could put the carrots into the trailer and bring them by train trailer loads at a time and we can put them in the colander „ can't we
yes
you put some carrots in the trailer and then the train
I'll get the engine driver ready and I'll tell him you're going on a very important trip this afternoon
you're going to the carrot farm to pick up some carrots to bring them back to the red colander
now
oh dear
he as tipped up Thomas
he needs to put them in here
oh that's lovely
that's one trailer load
is this his second trip
oh
some more carrots
thank you
thank you driver
that's a very important job „ isn't it
collecting and delivering carrots to the red colander
oh lovely
some more carrots
another carrots
some more carrots
oops another load into the colander and that's lovely
this poor train driver really is going to deserve a nice drink and perhaps a biscuit when he arrives home „ isn't he
working very hard
we should sing a song about carrots but I don't know one
I don't know any songs about carrots
do you Thomas
pardon
go to the shop
who sells carrots
which shop
what are you doing
you're smelling them and blowing them
do they smell nice
the greengrocer sells carrots „ doesn't he
the greengrocer sells carrots and so does the supermarket
I think little shops like the Spar shops sell carrots as well „ don't they
we can get some that are like we bought today
well we didn't buy them
but like Mummy as cut up that are all dirty
and you can get some that somebody has already peeled them and sliced them and they're ready washed
and you can get others that have been peeled sliced washed and frozen
packs
so when you get home all you've got to do is empty the packet straight into the microwave or boiling water and cook them for tea
what might you like to eat carrots with
do you know why that one's there
because you've just thrown it „ haven't you
look
they roll
oh poor engine driver
look
I've not quite finished my cup of coffee
shall we just give the engine driver a quick drink before he does the rest of the carrots because he's going to be so thirsty „ isn't he
and hungry
ask him if he'd like a drink
not turn it
I think he's sat in that cab for so long he can't get out „ can he
poor chap
shall I help him
one two three
oh he said he's very stiff with sitting a long time
oh is that nice
has he enjoyed his drink
there we are
thanks driver
I think on the AuntyMabel program they had carrots with fish pie „ didn't they
or something like that
we might have carrots with ShepherdsPie
you like ShepherdsPie
or we might have
another way of doing carrots Thomas
is you know the grating machine that we grate cheese on
do you know what Mummy means by the grater
shall I get it out and show you
and the grater is another piece of kitchen equipment which you can't really play with because it's too sharp
but we do cheese on this „ don't we
look
if I take a piece of carrot
watch
can you hear that sound
that's a grating sound

oh look at the carrot
well you can't play with this darling
you put your hand on there
you hold the grater
you hold it steady and I'll do that because if you get your fingers on there oh it'll cut
because it's ever so sharp
this is like lots and lotsof little sharp knives
I think Mummy better do it „ don't you
you just watch
no
you can lift the grater up and see what's underneath
oh grated carrot
oh great
no
we'll just use this piece
now grated carrot is nice with a salad
Mummy mixes grated carrot with coconut and sultanas
that makes a nice salad
ah look at that
no
it's too sharp darling
you can hold it but you mustn't grate
that's it
right
ah look
you've grated all that
we'll put that over here
look
because it's too sharp to play with
ah no
we'll just leave it on the table
let's get the driver to
right
I tell you what
before the driver delivers his next load shall he get out of his cab and sweep up
there you are
there's a little dish washing brush there
that's ideal „ isn't it
the driver sweep it
here you are driver
is he sweeping the path
you're sweeping with the brush „ aren't you
there we are
get the crumbs out
I think we're nearly clean now „ aren't we
have you swept it into a pile
sweep
is that what you were singing
there we are
right
shall we put the brush away now
oh we can't use these carrots though for the freezer „ can we
no
the horse'll eat this „ won't he
there we are
the horse'll eat that little bit of grated carrot
let's put it here in a pile
yum
the horse'll eat it
who's cross
Isabel
oh where's the driver
he's not in his cab
he as not got back in after sweeping the path „ has he
he as got to make one last trip to the red colander
the red colander
and then we'll find a nice
oh wonderful
you've been a big help
thank you darling
Mummy's going to rinse these under the tap now
and then we'll leave them to drain and then we'll find a little container to put them in
there we are
we've got to just leave them now to drain
let me show you now what happens
we put water in the top and look
water's dripping through the holes at the bottom
that's what a colander does
it drains so that water goes from the top into the bottom because they've got to be quite dry when they go in the freezer „ haven't they
right
we'll leave those now
and then we've got to think of

no
the carrots are ready for the freezer now
you've helped me do that
listen
we've got all that apple in there
that apple needs to go into your train
no
but the carrots are busy now waiting to go into the freezer
we've got to deliver the apples now
here we are
this is from the
now the apple
you ask the driver very nicely if he'll deliver
a little bit of grated carrot
yes
you can hold that
because the driver as not finished yet
he as got apple to deliver and he as got that little bit of grated carrot
now he as swept it up he's going to hafta take to the skip „ isn't he
because I think there was too much for the horse to eat
we could always ask the train driver if he'd take that little bit of grated carrot to the paddock so that when the horse wants to eat it he as got some
he as got out of the cab „ has he
he as put it into the cart „ has he
I bet you can't count the pieces of grated carrot „ can you
too many „ aren't there
but did you see how we changed the long orange carrots into rounds and into strips and we grated it
into the yellow cup
it's the „ isn't it
it's sposta be nice shiny brass but I've not cleaned it so it looks as you rightly say a mucky dull yellow
oh Thomas

has he got to deliver all the apples as well
his trailer's here
look
carrot begins with a letter c
oh no
like cat
for cat and for carrot
and for caterpillar
you've got a caterpillar on your bib „ haven't you
and for cup
you want your bib off
Thomas for carrot
for cat
for cup
for container
this is a plastic container
oh no
don't bang
and for colander
oh no
the colander's busy now
the carrots have got to go into the freezer
and do you know what it is in the freezer
cold
that's another
the carrots are going into a container and they're going somewhere cold
is that right
they're going into a skip
no skip
we haven't got a skip „ have we
could this be the skip
yes
that would make a good skip „ wouldn't it
and the other thing beginning with c is cut
which is what we were doing with the knife we were
cutting
oh darling what's the matter
carrots
well the carrots have gone now
for cut
for chop
for carrot

there's carrots there
look
oh no
if you're going to start putting things on the floor that's not nice „ is it
and the other thing that begins with c for clean up
and for cry
which is what you're doing
you've just banged your head but that was your own fault
and for clang
oh clang
oh crash
that's another word beginning with c
oh clang
clang
crash
oh you're a noisy boy now „ aren't you
oh what a noisy boy
oh you're sweeping up again
oh would you like the brush
there you are
sweep
oh Thomas not onto the floor
you don't sweep onto the floor
look
hold this with one hand and sweep with the other
like this
look
just let me show you
look
hold it with this hand and with this hand sweep
like a dustpan and brush
that's got to be lower than the table
sweep
oh darling you're a tired boy „ aren't you
that's what happens when you go to toddler group
you run round there so much and we walk home
are you tired
you tired baby
what's the matter
oh dear
everything's getting too much „ isn't it
now
everything's a real nuisance
you've done it
oh what have you done
you've done the carrots
you've done it
oh that sounded very Northern Thomas
you've done it
that was said with a lot of feeling „ wasn't it
I've done it
by gum
I've done it
oops

Mummy fell over „ didn't she
have you had enough to eat
watch
watch Mummy
I'm watching
I've done it
hooray
it's easy now
watch Mummy
I've done it
it's easy now
watch Mummy
I've done it
it's easy now
I think you're talking about
we have a little book Tom and Peepo „ don't we
and Peepo and Tom went on a sledge
and Tom was a little bit frightened about going on the sledge but when he finally tried it he realized it wasn't that bad
and he said
going on a sledge is really easy
we don't even need Daddy to take us
I think that's what you're thinking of
I've done it
