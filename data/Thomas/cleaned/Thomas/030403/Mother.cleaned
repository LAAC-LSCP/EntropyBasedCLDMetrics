yes love
who as got some roller blades on
is there a television program called Spider Thomas
somebody was telling me about this and I've not seen it
is it a good program
right
I see
right
well I can't say I've seen it but somebody was asking me if you watched it and I said I don't think so
because I ad never heard of it
but you obviously do
I know you're not eating a lot at the moment Thomas but would you like some toast
no toast
Mummy's going to have a little bit of toast with some Marmite
would you like some
it's not yucky
would you like some jelly
it isn't
jelly would be nice for your throat „ wouldn't it
your throat is nice
no
it'll make your mouth feel better „ won't it
you want something nice like jelly
well that's what I was saying
jelly would be quite nice for you „ wouldn't it
I'll let you finish those and then I'll get you some nice jelly
how does that sound
good
okay
gosh
that was a big bang „ wasn't it
what's that
a little smell
it was you
I thought it was
do you need the toilet
it was just a farty pants „ was it
just a little smell
I see
oh dear
it's not a very nice day „ is it
it as all clouded over again
it's not very nice „ is it „ today
it might brighten up
you never know
it'll either brighten up or it'll get much worse
the weather
if it doesn't brighten up it might be much worse than it is now
it's not very nice for August though „ is it
it's more like November
it isn't at all pleasant
right
I shall a little piece of
are you really sure you don't want that
on it
the cucumber
are you sure you don't want some of Mummy's toast
would you like a little taste
well I've got to wash it first and cut a bit out
yes
yes Mummy's friend Roy
not Roy Ron grows cucumbers „ doesn't he
he's always giving us tomatoes and cucumbers
it does taste nice Thomas
when you were teething when you were much younger you useta like it
excuse me
doesn't
excuse me
he doesn't give you sweets
he doesn't give sweets
it's nice „ isn't it
when you were teething and you needed something cool to eat apples and cucumbers and pears and raw carrots and cucumber was one of your favorites
it is nice you see
nice and refreshing „ isn't it
and Mummy's having a cracker
would you like a cracker
a cracker
a biscuit
two crackers
but you like the cucumber
don't you
well never mind
you had a little try „ didn't you
it's flat now
well it's always flat when I've sliced it
slice it flat
excuse me
I could hear that
what do you say
what do you say ThomasHenry
I think you could say excuse me please „ don't you
yes
they are „ aren't they
are you sure the crisps aren't making your mouth sore
are they okay
a little bit of sunshine
can you see it
what did you see outside last night
a big rainbow
I don't think it was last night but we have seen rainbows „ haven't we
the rainbow had numbers on it
what numbers did it have
that sounds like a postcode for CBBC OnChoice
was it on television that you saw the rainbow
out of the window
because the thing is you always say last night when you mean weeks and months ago
so last night doesn't necessarily mean last night „ does it
a big dinosaur with big containers on it
wow
oh right
well that sounds like one day when you must have gone in the car with Grandma and Granddad coming back here „ were you
and you saw a big container with flashing neenas
and what do you think was inside the container
I thought you might think that
hm
I bet it didn't really have sweets in it Thomas
it would be something else „ wouldn't it
cuumbunders
some cucumbers
drinks or wine or glass
fridges or what
calamine
calamine lotion
mhm
right
was it a round container
or was it a square one or an oblong container
round
like a milk tanker or an oil tanker
mhm
and did you think it had oil in it
I think it would be something liquid if it was in a big tanker „ wouldn't it
it might have been oil
was it nice and clean or did it look dirty
nice and yellow
like the sun
ah
that sounds smashing
was that a while ago that you saw that
was it
hm
you were saying tomorrow when I go in Grandma and Grandad's car you'll show me one
well we're not seeing Grandma and Granddad tomorrow
it'll be next week when we see them „ won't it
mhm
a funny little boy
yes
it's the pattern on your beaker „ isn't it
well I'm having a nice lunch „ are you
you've not really eaten very much „ have you
you just wanna drink
yes
no
don't start making noises
that's Daddy giving you milkshakes
and ever since then you've been wanting to blow bubbles „ haven't you
are you ready for some jelly yet
don't shake your head
answer me please
well you tell me when you're ready and I'll go and get it
no Thomas
don't shake your head
I'd like you to answer me because then I can tell what you've said
how do you shake your head if you're saying yes
no
that's how you shake it if you're saying no side to side
yes it's up and down
look
it has brightened up outside again
you told me
mhm
I don't think there'll be a rainbow though because it's not actually raining „ is it
Thomas no
no
mhm
put it back in there please
that sounds like a helicopter now
why do you think the helicopter's coming
oh it is „ isn't it
can you see it
can you
I can't
but I've heard it
oh yes
wow
where do you think that's going to
is it a police helicopter
oh who do you think is being naughty
what do you think has happened Thomas
you don't know
no
I don't know
it's naughty „ isn't it
mhm
do you think it's the same helicopter circling round
how did you know it was the police helicopter
a yellow and a blue stripe „ did it
did it have blue flashing lights
because they usually do „ don't they
but you can perhaps only see that at night
wow
I just heard the noise and then when I looked up I could see the helicopter but it had gone past
mhm
goodness me
did it
have you enjoyed that love
was that good
another biscuit
you eating jelly
don't make a noise
some jelly
are you ready for jelly now
I think you'd like that cracker
just bite into that and see what you think to that
it's what Mummy's having
I think you'd enjoy it
what do you think to that
it feels pooey
fair enough
do you like it really
why do you want me to look outside
if I turn my head round a big skip lorry might come round the corner
right
what are you doing while my head's turned
do you not want me to see you eating that cracker
I don't mind
I've given that to you to eat
you're not doing anything naughty
well you must think you're doing something naughty by asking me to turn my head
but you haven't Thomas
oh a train
I wonder if the police helicopter's flying over the top of the train
what do you think
eat it darling
I'd like you to eat it you've not eaten much over the past few days
I've got to look round so tight that you don't see me
so when you've eaten the cracker I can look at you „ can I
oh wow
you're obviously enjoying that
mhm
it's nice „ isn't it
no
don't throw food
are you tired again
pardon
mhm
your police helmet is very nice
it's quite strange because
mhm
it's quite funny you should have a police helmet on the table when the helicopter as just gone overhead
I wonder if he looked down and thought hello
if I need help there's a policeman on the ground
would you like to finish this now
had enough
mhm
pardon
I don't know what you're asking me love
snaky bar
a a little
a safety something
a safety bar
what's a safety bar Thomas
over correct
right
but what's a safety bar
hm
don't put your helmet in your food
has it
mhm
sometimes very naughty
oh Thomas what a lot of noise
shh
not so loud ThomasHenry
right
would policeman like some jelly
so you've no time for any jelly
you can't stop
well I ad better put the jelly into a container for you
alright
when
very good
when you've arrested somebody then you've got to eat jelly „ haven't you
that's a good time to eat it really
you'll probably enjoy it more when you know you've caught somebody being naughty
you
you throwing somebody naughty on the road
while you eat your jelly
you're better to keep them locked up with cuff handcuffs on in the back of the van I think
he might escape if they're just on the road
oh goodness me
silly jelly
I couldn't get it out of the bowl
and you don't want any apple to eat
what about a banana
shall we
I beg your pardon
get on with what
I told you before
I told you before about saying that
it's not nice Tom
is it
well I'm getting on with mine
who as taught you to say that
it's not really
well FiremanSam as got a lot to answer for „ hasn't he
nearly everytime I say who as taught you that you say FiremanSam
well I hope he as taught you something useful
I hope you know what to do if the house catches fire
what do we hafta do
ring
no
it's no good
the house is on fire ringing CBBC OnChoice and asking for a policeman
how about nine nine nine and asking for FiremanSam
oh eat it quick before somebody naughty gets to it
even though it's quick nicely
mhm
the big tree
you mean the pot plant on the table
right
hm

does that jelly feel nice and cool in your mouth
you've eaten a lot of ice cream „ haven't you
that cooled your mouth down
well I wonder if the sun will ever come out again this summer
I'm so glad we went to Spain
because we've not seen a lot of sun at home this year „ have we
mind you some days have been nice
we've spent a lot of days in the park „ haven't we
would you like some more
shh
just watch the jelly on the table
you eat that up
sorry
I can be what love
okay
hello policeman
is that the police station
somebody as been really naughty outside
it's the weather
it's being really naughty
it's blowing and it's miserable
can you go and sort it out please with your hat on
as long as you get there quickly I don't mind about you being loud
oh
is that what you're telling the weather to do
goodness
what do we need
our tools
what
what sort of tools do you need
what for a policeman
what sort of tools does a policeman have
a toolbox some pliers some sharp scissors
are you sure this is a policeman you're talking about and not BobtheBuilder
I know
but what would a policeman be doing with all those things Thomas
oh does he
right
cajun
what does cajun mean
cajun
I don't know what cajun means
I'm sorry
do you mean mean sweets
why does every conversation end up meaning sweet
shh
Thomas don't shout into your helmet
it's too loud
come on
I don't do anything when you say get my
please may I have
I'm sorry about that as well because I thought you were polite
what have I just said
oh you monkey
you only went please on the end
oh listen
listen
just opened the door to hear the police
that might be an ambulance
that sounds like an ambulance
did you hear that
well I did
I thought it was somebody come to help you
but you don't say get my and add the word please at the last minute
please may I have
you are a busy boy „ aren't you
right
let me just wipe your hands
that's alright darling
yeah
I know you didn't pinch the flowers
you just reached your helmet because I was too busy wiping the table to pass it to you
that's fine
now have you had enough lunch Thomas
you have
you absolutely sure
good
now what sort of tools would you like me to pass you
oh alright
you're going to bang the rain and the clouds away and pretend it's it just sunshining
okay
now be careful what you do with these „ won't you
mind
that's alright
don't bang the table
your sharp scissors
your belt
I think they're pliers
not scissors
some cables
hm
oh right
cables
I was trying to work out what you ad said
mhm
your nuts and bolts
not too loud Thomas
gently
there's a story about the sun and the cold
do you know it
I think it's
Tom just carefully
just quietly
the listen to the story
I think it as been on television recently
the sun and the wind are having a bit of an argument in the sky
and the wind is saying to the sun I bet I can get that man's coat off before you can
because underneath the sky walking on the ground is a man wearing a coat
and the sun says I bet I can get him to take his coat off quicker than you can
and the wind says no I can do it quicker
so the wind blows and blows and blows
and I think the wind thinks if he blows hard enough the man's coat will blow off
but in actual fact what happens when the wind's blowing the man snuggles up inside his coat and he wraps up really tight and he makes sure it doesn't blow off
and the sun's fed up of watching this and she says right I've had enough
I'll show you how I can get the man's coat off
and the sun comes out and starts shining
and it's really sunny and warm and hot
and what happens when it's warm and hot
we take our coats off don't we
so she took the man's coat off
ah
so are we pretending now it's nice and sunny and warm
like it was in Spain
no Thomas no
not too hard
gently
they're nuts and bolts and bits and bobs „ aren't they
let's just
you've got a little bit of something on your hand
I think it's a little seed from one of the crackers
thank you
you don't put your finger on top of something and then bang it
that would hurt
you'd say ouchq
and then who would you need
not the police man or the fireman
who would you needta come and help you then
owq
the ambulance man or the doctor or a nurse
what's the problem Thomas
did you
how did you hurt it with the hammer you weren't
you didn't
you didn't get you finger in the way „ did you
oh heck
let me give it a big kiss
oh
ah and a big huggle
mhm
yeah
oh
ow
I've hurt my finger
a little boy wearing stripy shorts came up to me with a blue and red plastic hammer and hit my finger
have you
well make sure you don't anybody with it
you're going to hit me to make me better
well I think hitting me caused the problem „ didn't it
oh no
you mustn't smack
is that better now
oh thank you
I would have preferred a kiss actually
I think that would have got me better quicker but never mind
never mind
okay
that's right
keep it nice and safe and snug
snug
means safe
snug
not too noisy Thomas
no
that makes too much noise
don't throw please
did they
who wanted to cut the fence down
was he called ThomasHenry
was he
are you
ThomasHenry who
ThomasHenry Lastname
oh no
you mustn't hit people Thomas at all
no
naughty
no
listen
you do that again and it's taken off you
that's very naughty
Thomas even in play
that is naughty
it didn't actually hurt Mummy because Mummy's quite tough
but I wouldn't like to think you were going to MissusPlattford's in September and doing that
what would she say if she saw you doing that
I do
she would say Thomas that is very naughty
you're always a good boy in nursery though „ aren't you
you're cutting my arm up there because up there there's a piece of black
fair enough
you're sawing my arm off „ are you
a quick ouch
ouch
my arm as dropped off now
you're putting me a green arm on „ are you
are you going to start screwing it together with these nuts and bolts
no
don't hammer
putting a little nut on there
you
you need a big scissors
right
ouch
that was a quick ouch
thank you
right
oh there's just a problem
I can't bend my arm
I need a little joint putting in at the elbow please
oh that's better
look
I can bend my arm now
oh that's lovely
thank you very much
very kind
okay
there won't be a problem now with my arm
pardon
what won't you do
are you
okay
right
okay
you playing with your dustbin lorry again
what does it say
n r p
where does it say that
let's have a look
it says super trucks on the front
oh dear
all the rubbish has fallen out
no
oh dear
no
you mustn't smack it
you tipped it up to show me something
that's why the rubbish fell out
well shall we gather it up and put them in the wheelie bins
that's right
the super truck is allowed on the road not on the wires
well that's right because we've got the recording equipment wires on the floor „ haven't we
yeah
right
well shall I start putting the rubbish in the wheelie bins
bits and bobs
right
is it the red light that's flashing
just that it's flickering a little bit „ isn't it
I will
I'll have a look at the red light first Thomas because that might be quite important
right
you've got clothes pegs and bottle corks in these bins
and I think the paper cards here
and the wrappers from the after eight mints I shall leave in a separate pile and they could go with the newspaper people „ couldn't they
on Tuesday morning
what do you think to that
oh no
I'm only joking
not the real people
I was just pretending
we've missed Tuesday anyway this week „ haven't we
so we'll probably do it on Tuesday
right
well I'll leave them
do you remember when we stayed in the lake district
you probably don't you were only eighteen months
old
hello dustbin wagon
I can't
no
is he hiding beneath the big wagon
or at the side
right
yes
steady
yes
it can
well when we stayed in the bungalow
yes
in the lake district
that's what I'm telling you
listen
when we stayed at the lake district
in the bungalow
we were told that the bin men
I think they came on a Monday morning
or it might have been a Friday
and we hadta wheel the bin to the bottom of the drive and we were told we must have it with the handle facing outward
because it saves the men time if they can jump out of the lorry and grab the handles
no
I'm not
right
but I'm just saying that I've left them at the bottom of my drive like this ready for you
with the handles facing out so you can run out
of your cab and you can get hold of the handle and you can wheel the wheelie bin
right
okay
nice and clean for tomorrow
well you've brought the yellow wheelie bin back so I'll probably fill it with these papers while you empty the black wheelie bin
I think the black wheelie bin as got bottle corks in it
that's quite alright
lotsof pegs
right
well that wheelie bin's full of rubbish
and I'm leaving these
these are flowers look
the flowers can go as garden rubbish in the recycling pot
you grew them at Grandma and Grandad's
no
well I'm just saying they're
I'm pretending that they're dead flowers and that we're putting them in the compost part of the dustbin
in the recycling part
it's garden rubbish
green rubbish
yeah
well I'm not going to reach it
I'll just put it out with the bin men
the bin man can do whatever he wants with it „ can't he „ now
thank you
what did he do
did he
pushed them on the road
oh is that the noise it made
has it got a flat tyre
oh dear
at the front
oh dear
is it flat because it needs some more air pumping into it
it can still broom „ can it
right
do you think it needs some more air in the tyre
just pumping
some more air in
or do you think there's a puncture and we needta
oh right
we ad better take the tyre off and put a new one on
hm
a new wheel
I think the yellow wheelie bin's still full or rubbish

you didn't collect that one „ did you
you certainly didn't
never mind
you can collect it now „ can't you
thank you
very good
yes
I can see
that's good „ isn't it
ohgosh
why as he got his neenas on
he forgot to give me a kiss
sorry you broomed away
ah
oh
oh what a nice kiss
wow whee
oh I like this
mhm hm

right
well let's have another kiss before you go
on my eyes
you can't kiss my eyes
I've got glass on

no
mhm hm
kiss you on the cheek
wonder if anyone as written a story about a dustbin lorry
we could write one „ couldn't we
there once was a little boy and
he was called Thomas
and he liked playing with
dustbin wagons
and on a Monday he enjoyed watching dustbin wagons through the window
right
where's the rubbish tip today Thomas
how about in there
do you know what would be ever so good
it would be nice to tip
that would make a really good rubbish tip „ wouldn't it
the back of your bicycle
the trailer
you don't want it
fair enough
that's okay
alright
very sorry
I'm very sorry
am I a funny little fellow
you're tickling my chin „ are you
tickling me under the chin
pardon
it might
I can't say it
it might be one of my friends on the back of the dustbin wagon
oh right
he was called Nick
right
Nick the dustbin wagon
Nick would be a good name for a policeman „ wouldn't it
because he nicks people
you're Nick the dustbin man „ are you
Nick

oh why are you going to give me a little tickle on my tummy button
oh
you're cheeky that's what you are
you're cheeky meeky „ aren't you
you feeling tired
whoops a daisy
oh bother
now you've kicked the wheelie bin over
oh dear what a mess
well it's quite alright
it's your wheelie bin and you're picking up the rubbish
it doesn't matter to me
well it's my wheelie bin but once I've filled it with rubbish and left it out for the dustbin man if the dustbin man knocks it over then it's his problem
just make sure you pick it all up and don't leave it on the road
