what are you looking for
a little wooden house from your train set
a baby house
a small house
you've thrown it somewhere
well let's have a look
let's
there's the church
you've got two little houses here with red roofs
you see a baby tree
oh in that box
perhaps it's a bush Thomas
a baby tree
small trees are often called bushes
we've got bushes outside
look
out near Daddy's car
can you see those bushes
those little trees
yeah
the engine tree
why are you calling it the engine tree
oh don't throw things
you'll throw it over there and NooNoo will tidy it up
I don't think NooNoo will
I think Mummy will hafta pick it up
did you
would you like Mummy to have a look
look
there's a tree
that's a big tree
and there's a little tree
we'll call that a bush
look
those are quite like Christmas trees „ aren't they
big fir trees
look the Christmas tree as fallen down
no lights
look at the little house there
and the large tree
now
that looks like Tesco look
it's a big tower „ isn't it
with a clock on top
have you seen that at Tesco
the big tower
and look we can put that on top as a roof
like that
you see an envelope
who's that from
Isabelle
I see a bit of gate
yes
it's a little piece of wood „ isn't it
to make a fence
but I think you'll find that in the train set there are some animals
so the pieces of fence are to keep the animals in „ aren't they
where is it
well it's all these little pieces of wood
look
we put them together to make a fence
can't you
well let's find the other piece
look
there's another house here Thomas
and that's a big building „ isn't it
look at that
there must be some roof to go with that
and there's another little house there
oh you've put one on top of the other „ have you
to make a big tower
another Christmas tree
yes
where does that one go
it can go wherever you like darling
I was looking for another piece of fence and then I could show you what we do with it
I think actually there should be four pieces of fence
but I can only find three

this morning
well shall we make it like this
look
look there's a house there
and look
two pieces of fence
and then
I don't know where the other piece of fence is
ah there it is
oh there's another little pig there
it
well let's put the fence there
across the bottom
like a big gate at the bottom
across the bottom there
and then we can have a tree standing up near the house
and I think you've got some horses in here
look
there we are
we could have a horse and pretend it's a paddock
look you've got a horse
a paddock
if you
a paddock
it's where horses are
paddocks

you like that name
a paddock
animals are left to graze there
we've created a little village you see Thomas
because you can have more houses there
and that big tower block like Tesco
the trouble is that train set came with some houses and shops and things which are all much bigger than the little wooden houses that you've already got
was this the little engine that came with the train set
FatherChristmas brought it
it's like that
oh this engine that you already had is a little bit bigger „ isn't it
turn that way
that's better
yes
where's that piece of bridge
oh Thomas
why do you keep throwing things
all done a piece of bridge
well listen
I don't wanna be a killjoy but I think it's time really for your nappie change
and then we ad better start breakfast
because we're going to see Nana and Granddad today
we've got to travel to York in a car and it's a long way
yes
Daddy is coming
Daddy's driving
so are you ready for something to eat and drink
no
I bet you are really
I keep finding more trees
and there's another little horse here
shall we put that horse with that horse
in the paddock
paddock
it's a paddock Thomas
when we next go out in the car
in fact you'll probably see some on the way to York
we'll see fields with horses in
but it's usually when they're
they're nearer farms
paddocks for grazing
what's that noise
it's the wood in the train set
buy a piece of cheese
do you know what these signs are Thomas
that says stopq
it's red and it says stopq
that one means level crossing
it means people can walk across the middle
and that has another red sign
do not enter
so that one says stopq
that's red and white
and this other red and white says do not enter
all you've got left in the box now is track
we've got these two very peculiar animals „ haven't we
I think that must be the cow and that must be a black sheep
does that fit
well it doesn't really „ does it
the track fits together like a jigsaw „ doesn't it
you're buying a piece of cheese
right
let's go and get you changed
and then have some breakfast
yes
you're not ready
no
I know
but we have got to go somewhere today Thomas
you've done it
well done
well done
you're not ready
let's
shall we put that there
Daddy usually builds this with you „ doesn't he
two more in the box
it's you being noisy
you're getting very clever at building track „ aren't you
is it like doing a jigsaw
yes it is
I don't think you hafta bang it
you can put it in gently „ can't you
it is hard
you've done it
there are two more in there
you've hurt your finger
what banging the train track
you oughta try and build it round there Thomas
because if we do that it'll make a big circle
when you're pushing your trains round they won't fall off „ will they
we having
two FiremanSams
what are you shouting for Percy
I think that's it now Thomas
we could just do with joining those two up „ couldn't we
like that
do you think they'll join there
do you think they will
oh I don't think they will
how's that


we'll hafta swap something somewhere „ won't we
that should work
oh it should work
but it doesn't „ does it
nearly done it
no
it hasn't „ has it
and I don't know why Thomas
perhaps we'll get rid of that straight piece
there
no
you don't need a hammer
it's working
why do you need a hammer
bang that piece of cheese
I think it's all working quite well anyway „ don't you
we could put that over there
look
put that on the table
it's a lovely train set „ isn't it
FatherChristmas must have been into wooden toys Thomas
because we brought you a wooden fire engine
and a wooden train set
he must have been very busy in his workshop „ mustn't he
all these on these things
his workshop
yes
he was making all these with his little helpers
and they must have had some beautiful bright colored paint „ mustn't they
because they painted the fire engine in yellow and red
and look at all the trains
what colors have you got on the trains
blue
dark blue
dark blue
and what else
that's light blue
dark blue and light blue
oh you know what that is
what is it
Percy
well it's green
and all the wheels are red
have you noticed
all the wheels and all the engines and coaches and carriages and trucks are all red
it as not worked
what did you say
all the carriages have past ThomasTheTankEngine
all bashed
oh have they had a crash
right
well I tell you what
let's play with the train set later
because we've got to get you changed
oh yes
we've got to have breakfast
well no
we can play a little later
because you can play with this after breakfast when we've
well we'll sort it out later
because we've got to get some cases packed
so you could play with your train set while Mummy was busy doing that
two trains do it high up in the air
Cranky
Crankythecrane
right
would you like to bring one of the trains with you
you bringing those two
oh who's a big boy
oh I can't bring a whole train set Thomas
a lot of trains
FatherChristmas must have been watching you „ mustn't he
because you ad already got a bridge
and a little train and a couple of engines
oh I think it was three
yeah but
alright
I'll get you some more
sit still
right
you already had this one „ didn't you
you had a little blue engine
and you had a blue passenger carriage
and you had this little green truck
is that what you have
three
oh and you had this as well
you had this little carriage as well „ didn't you
oh Thomas
you've got two engines
right
oh that's what you had
you had a blue engine
blue passenger carriage
a green truck
and you had this „ didn't you
that could have been the
and FatherChristmas has brought you a little black engine
a little blue
I think that must be a goods wagon
and a green goods wagon as well

middle
and the track matches exactly what you've already got „ doesn't it
a lot of suitcases trucks
that's very clever
a lot of suitcases trucks
you want something nice
you going to lie back now sweetheart
we'll get you changed
you don't need all those
oh
well where would you like to have your breakfast
at the table
or in your highchair
your highchair over there
you've been wanting to sit in your highchair again „ haven't you
over Christmas
I don't know why
but Christmas day we sat you in your highchair because when we had Nana and Granddad here for lunch we had a lot of food on the table
and a lot of people to sit round the table
and it was easier for you to sit in your highchair „ wasn't it
just next to the table but not at it
and ever since then you've wanted to sit in your chair „ haven't you
is your foot sore Thomas
you've got a little blister on your heel
how as that happened
somebody touched it
has somebody stepped on you
who
somebody
because your shoes aren't too tight „ are they
or your Wellingtons
can you see the Christmas tree lights
do you think Grandma as got a Christmas tree
she as got one „ has she
when we're going to York you'll be able to look out the window of the car and see all sorts of Christmas trees
and lights on in people's houses „ won't you
there you are poppet
how does that feel
you want another nappie
yes
I'll put you a nappie on
you can hold my jumper
and when we're in York we can go and see AuntieJanet „ can't we
and UncleStuart
and you'll probably see your cousins
you've got four cousins „ haven't you
Paul Stephen Timothy and Helen
but they're not little like you „ are they
they're all grown up
Paul's about twenty nine
and he lives with Claire
and then Stephen and Tim
Stephen's in his twentys and Tim's twenty
and Helen is still at school
she's seventeen
Helen will be eighteen in February „ won't she
come back later
Helen
come back later
oh Helen's coming to stay with us „ isn't she
in February
we've asked Helen if she wants to come and stay
and she's going to come and stay just after her eighteenth birthday
and then Helen will be doing exams
and if she passes she'll be leaving AuntieJanice and UncleStuart and going to University „ won't she
somewhere
and what's their little dog called
Biff
do you remember seeing Biff
you were playing with Biff's ball the last time you went
you were throwing Biff's ball „ weren't you
and what color was it
it was blue
that's right
it was very hard actually „ wasn't it
it was big
yes
I was quite surprised how big and hard it was
because he's only a little dog „ isn't he
what would you like me to do again
you'd like what darling
the dog
you'd like a dog
good
Stephen's dog
yes
Stuart's dog
you want Stuart's dog again
well we'll see Biff again „ won't we
he's only a puppy
I think he as got a little bed for Christmas
I think FatherChristmas brought him a lovely little bed for him to sleep in
and Grandma says she as got some presents at home
at her house for you
and we'll be going to see AuntieMonica at some point
Molica
Monica
and Paul
yes
Monica and Paul
and they've got two children „ haven't they
they've got Timothy
who's about eight and a half
and they've got Katie who's about five and a half
I think
AuntieMonica's not really an Auntie
we just call her Auntie „ don't we
AuntieJanet and UncleStuart are family
because AuntieJanet is Mummy's sister
but AuntieMonica is Mummy's friend
thank you
and UnclePaul is a policeman in York
and he'll have a policeman hat
yes he will
do you think he'll let you wear his policeman's hat
I think he will
you've worn it before „ haven't you
you've put it on
yes
oh big hug
and we'll be going for a meal in York
we'll go to a nice restaurant
no
oh be careful
you sillybilly
you could have done with your policeman hat on now
you've just swung the dining room lampshade and it as hit you on the head „ hasn't it
remember you're standing on the table
you're much nearer the lampshade
did that really hurt
oh
lying down
all fall down
the trains are all falling down
silly engines
is that the ThomasTheTankEngine song
right
little chicken shall we get you into the highchair
do you wanna sit at the table with Mummy
you wanna sit in this chair
one two three go
oh
you're standing up like that
you're going to sit
sit down with baby Jesus
yes
you've got the nativity scene just behind „ haven't you
he's here
well you sit down first
I can't
you've just done it
a piece of cake
yes
the Christmas cake's there as well
you can smell it
you probably can
it as got a lot of alcohol in it Thomas
does it taste nice
oy
are you pinching icing off my cake
oy
thanks done it
you cheeky monkey
yes
can you see the tin
the Christmas cake's actually on a board „ isn't it
but we've put a tin over the top just to keep
oh dear
just to keep it a bit fresh
and look at the tin
this is a nice tin „ isn't it
this is the one that Mummy keeps for Christmas cakes
it's empty
but look on the outside
what can you see
look
Christmas cake Christmas trees and parcels
and teddy bear
and rocking horse
Christmas crackers
and look
little train engines
I think a lot of people get train sets for Christmas
would you like a little piece of icing
while I get breakfast ready
ohgosh I dropped it pull it off
there you are sweetheart
let's put the tin back on
it is nice
it's very sweet
and you can see the nativity scene as well „ can't you
pardon
who's poorly
you're poorly
you've got a poorly leg
why
somebody tripped it
Thomas you've only just got out of bed
there's only been me and you
Daddy's still upstairs
and nobody as tripped it as long as I've been here
you perhaps haven't got your leg in the right place „ have you
that's it
Monica and Paul have a beautiful nativity set in their entrance hall because they've got a very big house
yes
they've probably got a big train set
and they've got a lovely nativity scene in the entrance hall
and when Timothy was a little boy perhaps your age everytime we went to visit them he'd move some of the characters round
perhaps he doesn't do that now because he's a big boy
does that icing taste nice

sounds like you're enjoying it
Mummy as lost her pen now
oh there it is
it sounds like AuntieLinda's birds
it is
it's the bird that sounds like the telephone ring
can't remember what Linda's birds are called „ can you
Po
I think one's called Milly
and there's one called Woody
Woody like WoodyWoodpecker
there we are
I'll just wash my hands
shall we have RiceKrispies this morning or Cornflakes
Krispies for a change
with milk
we ad better remember to take some RiceKrispies to Grandma's house
because I know she as got Cornflakes but I don't think they eat RiceKrispies
and we're going to stay there Tuesday night and Wednesday night and we'll come back Thursday unless the weather gets very bad
it's a lot colder in York Thomas
you'll hafta put your hat and gloves and scarf on
and jumpers
and where we're staying there's an electric blanket on the bed
Mummy always likes that
because it's very cold
not cold what sweetheart
no
RiceKrispies aren't cold
the milk might be cold though
because I'm going to get the milk out of the fridge
to put on top
we needta get some more milk
when we go to the shops
you're enjoying that piece of icing „ aren't you
can you hear
we've
oh Mummy as just knocked her bowl over
we've not listened to the Snap Crackle and Pop of the RiceKrispies for a long time „ have we
you've not seen Krispies like that before
you've not heard Krispies like that before
just a moment
no
they're not cold
just let me put a few more in there
is she
where
where
in the middle of the Christmas tree
I don't think she is Thomas
when Purdie was a little kitten
well I didn't really have her when she was a little kitten
because she came to me as a stray
and she'd be about a year old
but when she was a lot younger than she is now Mummy lived in a very big house with very big ceilings
I had a huge tree in the flat
when the students had gone home for the holidays Mummy moved their Christmas tree into her flat
it almost reached the ceiling it was so big
and we got it decorated with lotsof pretty things
and Purdie one Sunday morning ran right to the top of the tree
and knocked the whole tree over
and there was baubles and there was tinsel and bits of little
you remember the little pine cones from last year
all over the floor
Mummy's voice is going now
and Mummy had people staying with her
and they were sleeping in Mummy's bedroom and Mummy was sleeping on the floor
otherwise the tree would have been on top of Mummy
and Purdie was frightened
and oh
she ran around
and then she thought it was fantastic because all the little baubles were on the floor
and she was playing football with them
we saw her doing that the other night „ didn't we
do you remember that red apple at the bottom
the decoration that looks like a red apple
Purdie came in and she started pawing on the apple at the bottom of the tree
and she knocked the bauble off „ didn't she
and she chased it all round the living room
again
you wanna hear the story again
well Purdie was a little Purdie
and she ad never seen a tree inside of the house before
and outside she useta run up them
and sharpen her claws
so I think she thought she could do the same with the Christmas tree
so she ran right to the top
and the tree fell over
and all the baubles fell off
and the tinsel and the pine needles went everywhere
and Purdie was very excited
she as never done it since though
mind you we've never had a Christmas tree quite so big since
no
you can't run to the top
if you ran to the top there'd be trouble
because I've told you now what happens
and you know better
I think what we could do Thomas with those little wooden Christmas trees that you've got in your train set
I think we could get some PlayDoh
PlayDoh
we could make some little baubles to put on them „ couldn't we
make them Christmas trees
because we've seen a lot of Christmas trees outside of peoples houses with lights on „ haven't we
alright
put the icing down for later
right
that's lovely
we'll put it there
have you got sticky fingers now
would you like them wiping
that one's not sticky
no
you've only had it in one hand
there we are
we'll pop it on that little coaster for later
wipe this sticky little fingers with that
okay
would you like a drink of juice
you're fine
mm
this tastes nice because we've not had them for a while „ have we
paper chains
can you see the paper chains that we made the other day
can't you
oh I can't either
where've they gone
where are the paper chains
oh they're here
look
in the kitchen
they're nice „ aren't they
shall we show Grandma and Granddad the paper chains
later
it's one of Linda's birds
tweeting
cheeping
we'll hafta ask her whether it's Woody or whatever the other one's called
I think it's Milly
but I'm not sure
we went to see Linda on Christmas day „ didn't we
because we ad been to see her just before Christmas eve
the night before Christmas eve we went to
of course
of course
oh Thomas
I'm glad you reminded me about that
when we went to AuntieLinda's house the night before Christmas eve
we went in for drinks and a little something to eat „ didn't we
oh and they had a present for you as well „ didn't they
they gave you a present
and when Mummy knocked on UncleBrian's door I said I can hear carol singers because I could hear some music
but it didn't seem to be outside and I thought it was their television
but it wasn't because they didn't have it on
so we just forgot about it
and a few minutes after we ad been in the house we heard all this noise
music
and we looked out of the window and what was it
FatherChristmas in a tractor
it was
I think it was his sleigh actually darling
not a tractor
FatherChristmas was in
well he was sitting in a trailer „ wasn't he
surrounded by lotsof presents
and people were singing
and he was waving as he went past „ wasn't he
and the lady knocked on Linda's door and we went to answer the door
and we said tomorrow night when Santa comes please don't come to this house because we're only visitting
we needta come next door
I showed her which door we came from „ didn't I
that one
yes
yes
she was the lady from the rotary club „ wasn't she
and what did FatherChristmas say to you
what did he say
you don't know
I think he said happy Christmas or did he say ho ho ho
ho
is that what he said
and Daddy carried you
it was raining „ wasn't it
and Daddy had you in his arms
and he carried you down the street following FatherChristmas
because FatherChristmas was going up and down „ wasn't he
up and down Streetname Drive
well you see the thing is Thomas he was coming the night after
so we hadta come the night before just to double check which house you lived in
and this is why Mummy said to him please don't come to number forty three because this is AuntieLinda's house we're only visitting please come to forty one tomorrow night
and he did „ didn't he
yes
he was also checking that you were being a good boy
when Daddy had you in his arms and you were watching Santa you were being a good boy „ weren't you
but he was just checking
because if you ad not been a good boy he was thinking well perhaps I won't come with presents
he gave you some chocolate „ didn't he
he gave you two chocolates when you were in Daddy's arms
it was absolutely wonderful
and AuntieLinda and UncleBrian liked it „ didn't they
it was fantastic
and as we left Linda's house she said on Christmas day we'd like to see Thomas
so after we ad had our lunch before tea we went out to AuntieLinda's „ didn't we
for another drink
and what did you
where
what had you got on your head
you showed them your hat „ didn't you
that's right
yes
and UncleBrian took a photograph „ didn't he
you were wearing your little blue cords
and you had on a nice new silk
well it wasn't silk
a nice soft shirt
and a little ThomasTheTankEngine waistcoat
and then you put your new BobTheBuilder hat on „ didn't you
and you went round to see them
you told them all about the presents you ad got
and you were a little bit cheeky
because when we went to see AuntieLinda on Thursday night she had a bowl of chocolates on her dining room table
that was cheeky „ wasn't it
yes
who ad eaten them all
yes
oh Thomas
right
shall we have some toast now
you're not eating your lunch
you're not finishing your RiceKrispies
would you like another juice
oh no
you can't have chocolate orange Thomas
no
a slice of chocolate orange is for a treat
you're eating your meal at the moment
you don't need little treats when you're eating a meal
Sue's chocolates
yes
Sue bought you some chocolates „ didn't she
we haven't seen Sue
do you
oh
oh dear
oh what's Mummy doing
Mummy as dropped the loaf bread in the sauce of milk we've put down for Purdie
oh dear
I think we ad
I think we ad better take that one
we ad better take the bread out of the bag and pop it in a different container
we can throw the bag away „ can't we
although it can go in there
the rest of the bread „ won't it
you can throw that
yes
we put it in the bin for the dustbin
so what toys are you going to take with you when we go to Nana's
to Grandma's
now tell me properly
I think we can take the fire engine „ can't we
I think she'd like to see that
where's what darling
Purdie's saucer of milk
I've tipped it away Thomas
she hadn't really drunk it
I think she might have had a little bit
but she hadn't drunk an awful lot
and now
now it as had a loaf of bread dropped in it it won't be very nice „ will it
I think Mummy's cup of tea has gone cold
oh dear Thomas

because I was telling you never ever eat anything unless Mummy or Daddy or somebody you know very well gives it to you
and when you see things like pretty red berries on trees and bushes in the park you never ever eat them
because they'll make you poorly
and they're for the dicky birds
yes
and if we eat them the birds will go hungry „ won't they
you don't see the birds coming in here and having your jam sandwiches „ do you
so we have our food and they have theirs

these are the leaves of the little berry
they're tiny round red things „ aren't they
we can't really do that with the jam sandwich

prickly leaves

and stripy bits of bread
Christmas decorations
