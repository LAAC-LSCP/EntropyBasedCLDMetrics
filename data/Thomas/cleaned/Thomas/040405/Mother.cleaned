pardon
must believe us now
right
are we playing London trains
my glasses feel a bit loose I don't know why
screwdriver what a good idea Tom
I very nearly
lost them then
I thought they were going to slip off my nose
there's this very tiny screwdriver
I told you about it „ didn't I
that we only lose
use for glasses „ don't we
repairing glasses
now the trouble is when I take my glasses off
I can't see very well
do you remember that day
you weren't with me actually thank goodness but
I was in Didsbury I'd just had my hair done
I can't remember if I'd just had my hair done
I was about to have it done
the screw fell out of my glasses
and my glasses fell on the pavement
and that was the end of that
well they're not new any more
I've had them quite a while but
they repaired them for me
there we are
I've tightened the screws up

they're a bit dirty now „ aren't they
the screwdriver
well you just put it in the screw and turn it
don't play with it because it's specially for glasses
and when your glasses break
it's very important that you
no
it goes there darling
well I'll show you in a minute
no
no
you put it there
you don't play with anything in this drawer
right
do you think you know what that is
right
well open it up and have a look
no
it's not lotsof things
there's just one thing in there
no
it's not a bell
what is it
pardon
have another look

ah what's that
a tape measure
it's a tape measure
with a little special case
well when you pull it out
be careful with it
don't get it near your face
pull it out
right
now press the red button
let go
hafta wind it back up again
only it perhaps doesn't work
it's a very old one
that's what
it's sposta be
wind it up
but I would imagine it's gone a bit
squiffy with it being so old
squiffy

did you like that squiffyq
whiffy
don't know where it's
it was
somebody gave it to me at work a long time ago
I think it was
bought when we were away somewhere
I think there's a little leather case
with a drawing of the place on it
watch where you're going

oh it says the Isle of Wight
and it's got a picture of a ship on the case
look
somebody obviously bought it from the Isle of Wight
it's a metal one „ isn't it
genuine leather made in England
now don't because it might not
okay
woo
it sounds like it will and it's going to go very quickly
has it got stuck again
you can only come through this if you're as big as this
oh I'm probably bigger than that
quite a big person now
oh thank you Thomas
yes
oh well tiny people
even Purdie couldn't get past that
Purdie's too big „ isn't she
forty a
what's forty a mean
where does it say forty a
near the glass
what glass love
but I don't know what you're looking at when you tell me that
right
shall I put it away now
can't leave more things lying around „ can we
I wouldn't be very happy if it did
no
don't call me old Thomas
that's not nice
is it
right
is it an express
so it's always rushing around „ is it
do you
like to be a York train and go to York
we will be going to York
sometime soon „ aren't we
we can go very soon
we can't go now „ can we
I know but even pretending
well can we go now
ready to go
are you sure
right
well we'd better be quick if we're going to catch it
rush
I'm on
are you on
right
we've only just made it in time
by the looks of it
haven't we
I thought you were carrying that Thomas
oh right
are we only going to visit Nana for the day
or are we staying for a long time
we're staying over
well I'm sure
you could sleep
if we've got a nice warm duvet
a nice warm quilt
you could sleep without anything on
then I'll borrow one of
Nana's nighties
so we're just going for a day trip
oh right
so we really needed a change of clothes „ didn't we
well I think we'll just hafta go to bed with nothing on
ask Nana if she can pop some
underwear in the washing machine
so we've got clean underwear tomorrow
and clean clothes
oh no
because you forgot your luggage
oh I see
do you think
yes
do you think if we forgot our luggage
the train would really go back specially for it
do you
that sounds like a good service „ doesn't it
I'm ready
it is now
yes thank you
oh right
a nice green Lego brick
what sort of luggage is that
is it
yes
I need more than underwear though if I'm going away „ don't I
good
yes I'm on
how are we doing

going straight to Nana's
how shall we go on the bus

am I carrying all your luggage
have you not got a little rucksack with you
like you usually have
how about that nice green suitcase we've got
with the
handle

we don't hafta get off
shall we pretend we left our luggage at Leeds
Thomas
could you get the suitcase please
we're at York

when we got off at Leeds
I bet we didn't
oh no
don't say it's at Leeds station
surely not
oh no
yes
what back from Leeds
oh that's handy
quick Thomas that looks like a Leeds train
so would it not be stopping if it said express
pardon sorry I didn't hear that Thomas
it is „ isn't it
so it's not stopping
so it won't have my luggage on it

lost property train that's a new one
I bet that's full of all sorts of things Thomas „ don't you

has the train stopped
hello
hello have you got a green suitcase please
we left it on the Leeds train
well we got on at Manchester and we were going to York
and we hadta get off at Leeds

when we got off
oh yes that's my green suitcase
thank you very much indeed
that's just what I want
thank you
right
oh no
I've lost Thomas now
where's Thomas gone
Thomas

do you know I can't remember what I dressed him in this morning
I think it was probably green stripes
well I don't think my little boy would run across the rails
because I've always told him not to

what are you doing running across the rails


yes that sounds like Thomas
cheeky little boy
that sounds just like my son
bye cheeky little boy

I don't think he really likes liquorice
I think he thinks he does
but then when he has it he never does
I know Nana's given it to you before „ hasn't she
you had it where
did you
I think you like those sort of red boot lacy type liquorice sweets „ don't you
pardon
buy them
yes please
a York train
oh wow
that sounds nice
don't you
how's that work then
oh so you do hafta pay for them
I thought you meant you didn't hafta pay
I was going to say that sounds a bit unusual
bye
well do you know what I think your favorite saying is
just pretend
just pretend
Thomas
oy it's Mummy
oy
excuse me
excuse me please
Thomas

you wait until I get that Thomas Lastname train driver home
and he wants liquorice
oh I'll give him liquorice
I'll give him liquorice little monkey
I'll give the little monkey some liquorice

were you only teasing
you wouldn't really bump me behind on a platform „ would you

I'm joking
do you
really real sweets
no
I haven't
oh steady
well that's what happens when
you don't pick books and magazines up
did a little skid

no
I think we might have an ice lolly soon Thomas
shush
not if you're shouting and being silly though
well not just yet
a little bit later
no
you're not having
ice lollies don't fill you up
throats feel a bit better an ice lolly „ doesn't it
right
can you move some of these little toys please
or if you wanna keep playing with them
wait for the little man to come on
does it
so
oh dear
not my suitcase
suitcase for Jean
has been crushed up
what's that
was that
what was outside
right
okay
I didn't know what it was that was all
well why is my suitcase now in the crusher
oh dear
I can't keep track of this blooming suitcase
I really can't
it seems to be everywhere „ doesn't it
right then
yes
right
yes
underwear and ice creams hm
sounds different
yes please I'll have that
thank you
just a moment
let me get some money
fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety
there you are
toy money
thank you
yes toy money
oh no
that's
you would like a drink
just give me a couple more minutes in here
have a couple more minutes in here
and then we'll have a little break
I think we're both feeling very dry „ aren't we
are you
dirty old trucks ugh
dirty old trucks
who are dirty old trucks in the ThomasTheTankEngine box
have you got naughty dirty old trucks
in ThomasTheTank

oh
I have noticed that actually
the ThomasTheTankEngine books
Thomas
stop it
ThomasTheTankEngine books
there's a lot of naughtiness really goes on „ isn't there
people playing tricks on one another and
people being grumpy
and people poking fun at one another
I don't know
you don't know what I'll do when I'm dead
I won't be doing an awful lot of anything
I don't think when I'm dead
singing a smelly girl song
well I'll probably be smelly when I'm dead
I'll be very smelly when I'm dead
that's why you hafta bury me
don't you
well I would if you didn't bury me

well no
I still think I'd be smelly Thomas
thank you
you keep having me
what do you mean
you can't
when Mummy's dead Mummy is dead Thomas
and that'll be it
sorry
I don't know what you're saying to me now
what
I don't know Thomas
the end
oh yes that would be the end
yes it certainly would be the end
the end
Thomas stop it please
rough like this
it's not nice „ is it
and what does the police train do
a grit train
and what does the grit train carry
grit
oh look
here's the ThomasTheTankEngine book
books I mean
oh we've got them all muddled up
so I don't know which is which now

my Daddy's not having it
I'll sort them out in a minute
why
why are you putting
do you mean grit as in
things that you grit the road with
when it's slippy and icy outside
right
that sort of grit
or I just wondered if you're talking about cement then
you meant something different
oh dear
was
if it's grit Thomas
and it's put down to stop people slipping
surely the man shouldn't slip when he stands on it
he's standing on the point
or the bit that goes down
right
Thomas did the notes come out of this till
with the toy money
did they come out of the other till
have you had that out today
now where would you like me to put them back
no
we can't leave them on the settee
because it's going to get lost
if the coins go down the back you'll never see them again
because I can't get them back
if they go into the frame of the sofa
that's it
it's gone forever
that's where I think half of your toys go
the small toys
things like bits of Lego
I don't put things on the settee for that reason
or the chairs
well it's springs and things
you've got the frame of the chair
and then you've got the cushions
but there's a bit right down there
that we just can't get to
and by the time someone
oh yes of course you
yes
I told you before about not leaving Lego and things on
because I've forgotten what it is but
many months ago we lost something down there
a vital part of
one of your toys
has gone down there
and it spoilt the toy
because we can't play with it now
well we won't see it again
and probably if ever the sofa lasts long enough
to recover it
by the time we get round to having it recovered
you'll be grown up
and won't be interested in toys any more
I'm just gathering these pennies and things together
right
I've forgotten what we were talking about now
grit
that's right
grit
are you alright
I told you you'd be tipped up now
oh
what's that your thumb
look
this actually says Thomas
let's play let's go shop
let's play with money
money tray with coin compartments
include pretend coins and bank notes
there must have been some bank notes in there as well
isn't there
no
we are playing grit
it's just I'm tidying it up
before we lose bits down the sofa
but when I stopped to ask you before
about the bank notes
you were
you didn't seem to think that the notes came with it
but I think they must do
did they
well they're all kept in the same box
do they they both fit in
what do you wanna do with these train sockets
no
I'm not leaving anything around
what do you want me to do with it
the work bench
that's
he's very busy that chappie „ isn't he
is it icy
is it slippy
and that's why he needs to
they
oh I see
well the trouble is you see the
poor man dropping the grit
where he drives
it's not gritty „ is it
because he's not dropped the grit yet
is that where he's getting all unstuck
having problems
oh that's better „ isn't it
yes
that's it
once the grit's gone down everybody can grip
can't they
right
why
I would imagine he's run out of grit „ has he not
oh look at that
that is a baby one
I don't think that would carry much grit Thomas „ do you
oh yes
but that's a big one „ isn't it
it could do with caterpillar wheels
they're things that grip well
aren't they
caterpillar wheels
I'm trying to think
I don't know whether you've got anything at all „ have you

something like a bulldozer
I don't think you have actually Thomas
have we
the digger
that's right yes
do you know where it is
no
I don't
but yes you're right
that's caterpillar wheels
do you know what I mean „ don't you
they've got a very good tread on them
oh here's your tow
look
are they
so are they getting out of their truck
to have a break
or are they just going to sit in the the
in their cabs and talk to each other through the window
are they
right
is it
oh dear
they're not having a lot of luck these grit men „ are they
having quite a bad time „ aren't they
so has he actually skidded
and tipped upside down Thomas
did he
keyboards
did you say keyboards fell down
Thomas
pardon
oh cables
I thought you said keyboards
I was just wondering what keyboards were doing in a truck
I see
no
well yes

you don't seem to be having a lot of luck today
with any of those trucks
do you
and o sixty six
what's an o sixty six
right
were you thinking of
a sort of A A truck when you said that
wrong
I just thought with you calling it an a something
A A
well there are A A trucks „ aren't there
Purdie's what
she's not
she's outside
has she
oh well she's still outside Thomas

we still know where she is
well no
that's true we don't
but do you know where she is
did she
well it sounds like you had a better idea of where she is
if you saw her go in the bushes

wasn't really for caterpillar wheels
if I can find something with them I shall get them out
where
oh yes the army tank
that's very true
it's a bit noisy though „ isn't it
no
right
is that the one with your motorbikes on

no
we can't have anything very noisy on the tape

what upsets you
right
could you go please
no
you don't Thomas
you have so many things out
right
I want you to tidy up
not get more things out
what's the matter
will you come here please
a bouncing ball
is there a little man in it
I think that was in somebody's party bag „ wasn't it
I can't
I can't remember whose
but it's a nice little blue
almost looks like an alien „ doesn't it
now you be careful
with that please
well because if you bounce it in here
and it hits something you'll be in big trouble
that's why
are you
can you remember whose party bag it was inside
pardon
the toilet

be quick if that's where you needta go
no
go on Thomas
if you need the toilet go quickly
otherwise you'll leave it too late

pardon
which animal
I can't
you're playing with an old shampoo bottle „ aren't you
an empty shampoo bottle
is it sposta be an animal in the sea
yeah what is it Thomas
oh is it
it's very good
I don't think I would have guessed that
oh yes

I do yes
do you wanna make fudge today to deliver
can you
yeah
right
that sounds very nice
where have you seen that made
mm that sounds nice
who told you that
I think you're right
just wonder how you know
well have you seen it on television
or has somebody told you
no
you didn't
it was a good guess
but the thing about the milk and the cream
I thought you must know
because even though we've made cakes and buns
you still always ask me what the ingredients go in it
so if you've suddenly come out with
the right ingredients for fudge
I think somebody's told you
you thought „ did you
yeah
then I think you put it into a big tray „ don't you
I don't think you cook it actually
I think once you've boiled it up in the pan
do you
yeah
oh right
you're playing with yellow bath sponge now „ aren't you
because I've seen
they boil it up in those big pans
but then you pour it into a big flat tray
and then when it's set
that's when you cut it into squares
to make little cubes of fudge
fudge even
simple fudge
cutting it into small squares
I was going to say cubes
and squares
are they
yes please
when I went to work the other day
there was a box
with a picture of Devon on it
you know those big Devon cows and scenery
and one of the ladies at work had been to Devon
and she said we brought back some fudge
and coffee
so I opened the box
and there was one piece of fudge left
lots and
oh I ate it
lots and lotsof toffee
but only one piece of fudge
so obviously everybody
preferred fudge to toffee „ didn't they
no
I didn't bring any home
no
because the box she brought in
was to go round a lot of people
if there's any left when I go in this week
I'll bring a piece of toffee back
well I don't think she would
because it would lie in a box
again
that was just a little holiday „ wasn't it

shush
don't get
yes don't touch this soap

big slider
what's a big slider
I have
and my nose is clean
because I'm using my nose to smell „ aren't I

just melts in your mouth fudge „ doesn't it
toffee's quite hard to chew
you know when you've got a piece of toffee in your mouth
but fudge even if it's a big piece
it melts „ doesn't it
when I say melt
I don't mean it quite melts
but it's all soft
oh beautiful yes
I could eat that
that does smell nice

well I think I've smelt it Tom
you can get different flavors of fudge as well
you can put all sorts of things in fudge
like bits of nuts or raisins
well this one's a special one
or
is it
what's that got in it
strawberry fudge wow
oh yes
is it
I remember some sort of toffee
it useta have a layer of toffee
and a layer of
yes please
oh
oh thank you
don't break any off Thomas please
and
a layer of sort of strawberry
and perhaps a layer of banana
do you
apple fudge
I've not heard of that
don't pull that Thomas please
no
no
because
no
I don't want you playing with that
Aunty Jane's dog's called Fudge
well it was called Fudge
she's got two little dogs now
you mean the fudge
and it was sort of fudge colored „ wasn't it
and she had it quite a long time
no
don't throw it Thomas
if that's thrown again I'm taking it off you
because when you're throwing it up water is going everywhere
what sort of box are you going to serve it in
what sort of box are you going to serve the fudge in
right
no
can't say I've ever seen fudge tossed Thomas
I think you're thinking of pancakes „ aren't you
is it really
well I've not seen that before either

I know what I'm going to make in a minute
I know what I'm going to make in a minute
clean feet
prepare yourself
right
come on
put the sponge down now please
don't scream and
head back

sit down please
your hands look a bit cleaner
I'm going to cut your finger nails as well
give your nails a little scrub
no
no
no
you're not
it's only because I've just said it's late
fibtails
well you weren't too tired
a few minutes ago „ were you
when you were
you just don't like it being done Thomas
well you should think twice then about running in the garden
without anything on your feet

stand up please
and then you can think twice about coming in
when I say it's time to come in
to get ready for bed
you won't be tired then
no
stop whinging Thomas
sit down please
let's do your face
your eyes shut please
one more
then I'll just give your neck an extra wash
there we are
okay
how's that
I was just thinking actually
a strange hand
and it's Mummy's new rubber glove
I got new rubber gloves
and I cleaned the bathroom earlier on today
I cleaned the bathroom earlier on today
yeah
well I was wearing the rubber gloves
I used a cloth to clean with
I'm a bucket
put the cloth right at the side of the bath
while I was standing there
and I could smell it
right

this rubber smell
listen
smell them
do you think so
that's probably the
I was using those
let's do your hands first
I was actually using a lemon cleaner
so perhaps it's the lemon cleaner you can smell
now your finger nails are not too bad „ are they
just give them a bit of a
your toes are very dirty
there we are
grab the other hand please
that's why we needta keep your nails clean
looks like snow „ doesn't it
but it's the spray from the soap
when I
scrub with the brush


right
well you've got to put your foot up Thomas
want me to rest it on that sponge
is that more comfortable
no
but for your heel
is it more comfortable
I'm just tickling your toes „ aren't I
ha
actually it gets them clean very quick
keep your foot on that please
that's a good giggle
put your feet down and we'll rinse them off
look at that
that's very good
no
not underneath
I haven't scrubbed underneath
I've only scrubbed the nails
come on
come one
let's put it
does it tickle
doesn't hurt „ does it
ha
there you are
the thing is
my feet got dirty
when I went on the soil
but because your skin's so soft
the dirt really has just
whereas my skin's all rough and horrible
and the sand really stuck to mine
so actually your feet are a lot cleaner than mine are
right
do you wanna rest this one on the sponge
right
that's it
so it doesn't hurt you


what are you shouting at
hiccups on your toes
oh you have got hiccups
oh you always get
I know you did
you must have got very excited
right
wait a second
let's just have another
one more scrubbydub
let's have a look at your other foot
trouble

shush
I can't hear what you're saying
like Brian's hose pipe
yes
you shouldn't have kept saying
about you daren't squirt because
one day you'll think I bet I don't
and then you'll be shocked „ won't you
shush
don't shout
well no
but Thomas do you not remember
when UncleBrian got very upset
well the people living at the Battersby's house
that girl
to have a water fight
and they started throwing water
because Linda and Brian enjoy sitting in the garden
in their deck chairs
in the summer with a newspaper
and a drink
once here they got really hot
when there was people messing about with water
and it happened time and time again
and so you must never
if you're playing with a water gun
or anything like that
you never squirt it at Purdie
and you never ever squirt it over
the fence
because it's not funny
no
well that's different
if you're squirting each other
and you're having a planned play fight
but it's not nice when you know
if they were sitting there in their nice clothes
and suddenly they get wet
that's not at all nice „ is it
now let's brush your teeth
can you put that down please Thomas
if I manage to cut your nails
right
put those feet down now please
Thomas do as you're told
but you were tired
you've just told me you are tired
now if you are let's hurry
and get to bed
you've still got hiccups now „ haven't you
there we are
do you like the taste of the toothpaste
did that hurt you there
did I hurt you
or do you mean there's a little place in your mouth that hurts
I hurt you
with the brush
oh I'm so sorry
is there a little sore place on your gum
I'll have a look at it in a minute

you like that „ don't you
when the cold water you
I'll wipe that little face again

when I've just got out of the bath
and put clean clothes on
stop it Thomas
you do say some stupid things
don't you
right

how's that
nice and clean ear
I'll do the other one
well yes you wouldn't be at all happy
if you were in your best clothes
doesn't even hafta be best clothes
but whatever clothes
if you're nice and dry
and you're sitting enjoying
a bit of peace and quiet
and reading a newspaper
yes
but no
Brian was only teasing „ wasn't he
when he said he didn't
did he
well you've nothing on your legs
you had bare legs
and you were all along teasing him „ weren't you
no

I don't want you turning into a big thug

you must sound like that
microphone downstairs
when it's not working properly
you know when it jitters and misses out words
sit down please
oh Tom
right
I'm getting the scissors now
you're all ready for collection
right
let's have a little

right
we'll start with your finger nails
let's see how they go
most of them are quite short already actually
oh no
I won't
yes
what are you pretending to be
a gun shooting
oh Thomas
why don't you have a little
oh you've just brushed your teeth
have a little sip of that
and see if it takes your hiccups away
no
you can't do it upside down
it won't make any difference
no Thomas
don't be silly
did you

well we can always do your teeth again „ can't we
oh dear
just try a little drop more
sit still please
you need something to concentrate on
that
if you concentrate on something
that can often take your hiccups away
oh dear
hafta think about something
what can you think about
toys
that makes a change from sweets I suppose „ doesn't it
never mind
done this anyway
you want a shock
you've got to go to school tomorrow

was that not a shock
oh
thought it would be
no
I'm not
I'm not hitting you with anything
surprise you like a clown

pardon

looking at your rubber ring
pictures of clowns on that „ are they
there you are
that's one hand done
let's get the other hand done
have you finished your juice
drink your juice up
drink the juice Thomas
there that might help
usually having a sip of water
takes them away „ doesn't it
pardon
don't think about it
can you
hiccuty kicketie cuppeties
you always had a lot of hiccups when you were a baby
better
good
that little bit of juice just worked „ didn't it
we'll hafta do your teeth again now
because you don't want juice
staying in your mouth all night „ do you
well it's not so much what it tastes like but
the juice is a bit acidy
and it
acid it's like lemon juice
lemon juice and vinegar are acid type things
and what it does
you know your teeth are nice and white
well the acid in the night when you are asleep
well not just when you're at night
all the time there's acid in your mouth
and it starts to eat away at the white enamel on your teeth
but
yes that's right
it would damage the new teeth underneath
and so
when you've had something
to eat last thing at night
you hafta brush your teeth again

no
it's nothing in the drink
it's just acid
it's just what's coating your teeth
start to eat the white enamel
and make little holes
so if you brush your teeth before you go to bed
then it means
reduces the acid in your mouth
and while you
just sit still Thomas
pardon
pardon
don't know what you mean
grasses is one pound
what's that mean
acid
no
acid
acid not grasses acid
and this is why you don't
acid
this is why you don't
no
acid yes
I know Holly's Dad's called Sid
so I suppose he is an a Sid „ isn't he
what
this is a different acid
and it's not spelt the same
a Sid as in Holly's Dad
is a s i d
acid is a c i d

a Sid acid
no
so when you're
this is why you shouldn't eat sweets in between meals
because in between meals
there's enough saliva in your mouth
to take away the acid from the meal
as long as you don't put other rubbish in your mouth
before the next mealtime
and if you do
then the saliva hasn't got the chance to take the acid away
and you're putting more sugary sticky things on your teeth
and it just rots your teeth Tom
no
rotten not dropped them
rot them
well the acid attacks the enamel
then you get a little hole in your tooth
and then oof it hurts
well I'm not saying you'll never have it but
when you do something like drink juice just before going to bed
I think the best thing we can do for you
is to ask you to brush your teeth again
don't you
oh you can do
yeah
well no
I needta actually be there Thomas
children under a certain age
should really have Mummys and Daddys there because
you only need a small amount of toothpaste
oh you have brushed them before on your own I know
haven't you
did very well
but remember that toothbrush is going in your mouth
so you don't mess about with it
you don't start brushing anything else
or touching anything else
how are these nails feeling
what do you mean very hard
I'm nearly finished
oh they're looking beautiful and clean
they are honestly
I know you don't sweetheart
it's a funny little noise this „ isn't it
snip with the red scissors
when you were a baby you had some with
blue handles scissors
these red ones are the ones
that we keep in the bathroom and we all use them
the blue ones I think are in the drawer
well no
but the blue ones are very rounded and very
gentle for little babies
because of course you know when you're only a baby
well
I'm sure they'd still work but
these work better I would imagine
now you're a bit older
pardon
well you can cut things on your own
paper and things
although I still needta be around
I wouldn't let you loose cutting your own nails Tom
well because it's quite a tricky job
and
if you cut them badly
or you cut the skin it would hurt an awful lot
well then you'd have a poorly toe
well no
I don't think you'd need stitches
unless you actually cut your toe off
I think you'd need a jolly big pair of scissors
to do that „ don't you
or garden shears
oh certainly bigger than baby scissors yes
snissors we nearly said then „ didn't we
snippers
scissors

yes that's why I was saying a pair of garden shears would be
good for cutting your foot off
but I don't think they'd cut your foot off
there you are
those beautiful feet
shall we put some nice powder on them
so they're nice and fresh
yes
no
alright then
okay
just a little bit
just a tiny sprinkle
no
on your foot Thomas not half way up
well alright
you put it on my hand then
and I'll put it on your foot
that's enough whoa
thank you
there you are
because these little feet have done lots
of things today „ haven't they
alright then
rub it on that foot
there you are
you can do it now
no
you can't have any more powder Thomas
there you are
you can rub it into your feet
Johnson's powder
I know
so we'll be hoovering tomorrow „ won't we
Johnson's baby powder
that's the smell
I think it's got vanilla in it actually
I'm sure somebody told me it's got that in it
ingredients
but it doesn't actually say
what the
what the scent it
right
little man
sorry
well it's a nice smell „ isn't it
it's a very gentle smell
you always think of babies when you smell this smell
not a noisy smell
baby lotion
no
it doesn't sting
but when you've say you've been out in the sun or
or perhaps even in winter in the wind
I pop a little drop on your face
there you are
right
I'll get some pyjamas
oh guess what

we were doing a tape and I forgot
right
you're going to stay here please
while I go get
pyjamas and then we'll
don't think anything's bleeding in your mouth Thomas
right
