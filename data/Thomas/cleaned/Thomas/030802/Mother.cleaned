what sort of sticky bun would you like bus driver

with the icing on top
oh we've seen those in the baker's in Didsbury „ haven't we
oh well I'll hafta get

oh and don't forget I've got my little boy Thomas with me
and he'll want a drink „ won't he
what will he want
you think he'd like some orange juice
yes okay
the number seven bus
oh it's a double decker „ is it

a double decker
oh heck there's a double decker bus and I still haven't finished my coffee
oh I'm sure the driver will wait a few minutes
it's a bit hot you see
I can't rush it
do you know what you useta call double decker buss Thomas when you were little
twobus
a twobus because I think you useta think of one bus on top of another bus because it's a double decker bus
and you useta say twobus
and do you know what you useta call red buss
po buss
do you remember doing that
everything red this table pillarbox everything was a po
a po bus

oh thank you
you sounded like you exploded when you drank that Ribena

I'm in
with my little boy
what's my little boy called
Thomas
that's a nice name for a little boy „ isn't it
right we're in
now Thomas sit down and be good

the noise of the door shuting or the bus setting off
right
well I hope he doesn't run out
I hope he goes down the steps carefully and waits for his Mummy „ don't you
because it's a bit dangerous running off a bus „ isn't it
oh dear
well I don't think the driver would let me get on „ do you „ if I hadn't got any money to pay for the journey
does he
he's a nice bus driver „ isn't he
perhaps he thinks I'm an old age pensioner and I travel free

goodbye
I've lost track of where we are now
are we back on the bus
I'm at home now
oh good
I think I'll read a little book about something
I'm going to read a little book about five little kittens
do they
ah well we'll read the story and then we'll have another bus journey
the woods are bright and sunny
a lovely place to roam
five kittens saw a honey bee and asked where is your home
how many kittens can you see now Thomas
five
who's that one like
and who's that like
a buzzy
oh yes the bee
I'm pointing to the bee
but what's the black and white pussy cat like behind it
silly
I was thinking more of Felix
and who's that
Ginger
so so far we've got Purdie Felix Ginger
and there's a grey cat and a white cat
we don't know those „ do we
might be Molly
well shall we pretend that one's Molly
and what about that one
Tiddles
it could be Tiddles „ couldn't it
right
the bee replied my home's a hive
that's where I'm going to fly
so Tabby kitten
that's the one that's like Purdie
followed the bee just as a mouse ran by

a little mouse ran by
but wheat is heavy the mouse said
I think I need a rest
four kittens asked him where he lived
he answered in a nest
how many kittens now Thomas
no
one
one
two three
four kittens because the tabby as run away
well the tabby went after the bee
ah grey kitten
that's the one we said was going to be Molly
grey kitten said I'd like to see the house the mouse has made
and off he ran just as a squirrel came hoping through the glade
look the tabby pussy cat as gone
the grey pussy cat as gone
what's left
three
Ginger Felix and
Tiddles
I can
well we'll go back to this other book later
goodness me that sounds like the bus is coming
quick let me get my handbag with more money
there we are
quick
got my drink of blackcurrant
right
oh when he gets a bit nearer I'll put my hand out and flag him out
flag him down
stop him
hello
hello
Didsbury please
how much is that
one pound
oh blimey
it's usually eighty pence
oh well there you are
oh well that's not too bad
thank you very much
I've given you a pound and you've given me fifty sixty seventy eighty one pound eighty change
oh marvelous

I like your bus
I've got eighty p more than I've got on with
that's great
right let's got to Didsbury
are you stopping anywhere else on the way
just Macdonalds
for lunch
oh
perhaps that's why you've given me one pound eighty
so I've got some pennys
right
okay
you tell me when we're there
it's a very long way to go to Macdonalds if we're going to Didsbury from here
because Macdonalds is near where Daddy works in Fallowfield „ isn't it

completely the wrong way
oh
I might have known you were the driver because it's a noisy bus
