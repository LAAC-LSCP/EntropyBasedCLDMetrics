Thomas just have a look at this red digger outside
it's a red lorry
it as just pulled up outside
it's a red lorry but it as got a digger on the back „ hasn't it
beep beep
that's a big truck „ isn't it
oh it's a bit dirty „ isn't it
it as got dirty wheels
yes
there's the little red car trying to get past the big lorry
yes
it's the digger on the back „ isn't it
it's the big digger
well I think it as got one wheel on the pavement and one wheel on the road so it's half up and half down „ isn't it
yes
that's right
that's Tiddles the cat from next door
she's having a look at the truck now
she better stay away from it or it might hurt her
beep beep
yes
the wheels are a little bit dirty
oh look at Tiddles
she's running very fast across the road
she's going home
oh now what's coming
a big green LandRover
steps
are you saying steps because the truck is parked half on the pavement and half on the road
and it's half up and half down
are you wanting the truck to come down onto the road
yes
the driver as got in the cab now
and he's driving backwards
oh I see
he's just pulling his truck in a little bit further because he's blocking the road and the cars can't get past „ can't they
no
he's not going anywhere
he's getting out of his lorry and he's closing the door
oh it's quite dirty „ isn't it
did you see that lady throwing some sticks onto the back of the lorry
yes
she should
well
this is quite true
we've been telling you off for throwing things
and she's throwing things
but the difference is she as just moved house and she as got quite a lot of rubbish she wants to clear
and so the builders come with these lorrys so that she can throw things into the back of the lorry and he can take them to the skip
so when she's throwing things into the back of the lorry that's alright
she's putting them in on purpose
but you sometimes pick things up and just throw them „ don't you
isn't it funny watching things going up in the air and landing in the truck
oh it's quite dirty
quite a dirty truck
your eyes look tired
did you have a nice time this morning at the playgroup
whoops
two cars are coming together and they can't get past „ can they
oh it's Purdie
down truck
oh look
the lady and man are coming back with some more things to throw on the skip
yes
oh are you pretending to drive the truck
there's another lady walking past
she's wearing a blue hat
she always wears a blue hat that lady „ doesn't she
truck
is it dirty

the wheels are quite dirty „ aren't they
that's the digger on the back
did you have a nice time this morning at the playgroup
no

and did you see Sue
yes
have you finished looking at the truck now
that's the front door

Mummy's just going to open the door so Purdie can go out if she wants to
is that what the truck says
oh
that was a big noise „ wasn't it
bash
there was bash „ wasn't there
they threw something quite heavy into the back of the truck
shoo shoo
that's Tiddles the pussycat from next door
what are you saying to her
shoo shoo
because Purdie wouldn't like it if she saw Tiddles „ would she
in her garden
Tiddles has a red collar
she's wearing a collar round her neck with a little bell
and the collar is red
do you think Tiddles is going to run away in a moment
no
say goodbye
she's going
she as gone
gone
yes
the driver's
oh he as just thrown a bucket out of the back of the truck
a white bucket
he must be going to stay for a while because he as turned the engine off now „ hasn't he
it as all gone quiet

perhaps when he as taken all that rubbish to the tip he might wash the wheels on the truck Thomas
no

but don't bang
that's right
wave and say hello to the truck
knock
