pardon
DidsburyPark
bang the big huge drum
you want me to bang it
bang
am I a good Jean
well that's nice to know
you have
yes
UncleDavid bought you that when you were only a baby
because he was determined you were going to have a drum so you could make lotsof noise
so this is nice „ isn't it
there's a little drum and two bells
and a xylophone
oh
and that button when you press it makes some beads pop up and down
and they make a rattly noise „ don't they
you'd like me to press the button
how's that
right
we better put it to one side now because we'll get
right
that's it
we'll play with it later
come on
it's breakfast time Thomas
it's going to make too much noise
you know what Mummy's like in the morning before she as had her breakfast
oh
now you like band music „ don't you
we had the radio on the other day and a band started playing and you said I like bands
you wanted to be what
oh yes
did you
oh no
did you
yes
and we saw that band „ didn't we
and there were two horses
they weren't really leading the procession
I think the police horses and policemen were just there to make sure there was no trouble
and then the band played „ didn't it
and people marched along banging drums and singing
and when we saw AuntyMabel
that program on the television
and do you remember when they collected all the daffodils
in Lincoln „ wasn't it
we watched all of the people who worked for the daffodil growers
growing daffodils and picking daffodils
that's right
they put them in the machine and they
what did they do
what did the machine do
it stacked them into bunches of twenty „ didn't it
and cut them so that the stalks were all the same length
that's right
you're doing it on the table
cut them
and then wrap them
that's right
put them in boxes
that's right
they put them in boxes in bunches of twenty
yes
and then all the boxes went into that very cold storage room „ didn't they
and then later on the lorry came and carried the box
the boxes were stacked into the lorry and the lorry delivered them
and then AuntyMabel said when all the daffodils had been picked and the daffodil season had finished they had a big procession „ didn't they
and do you remember that song AuntyMabel sang
I can't remember the words
another band coming
that's right
AuntyMabel was on a float „ wasn't she
do you remember the procession
and the band followed „ didn't they
pardon
that's right
when she got home she was still singing that tune
when she arrived home she took her coat off and hung it on the coat peg
and and she was still going
right young man
you're not a young man
you're a snotsnot
oh dear dear
you say snotsnot when you mean pig „ don't you
pardon
yes
these things are not
oh not fit in bowls
they will
here you are
look at that
fit perfectly
would you not like it in a bowl
well we'll try these today instead of our usual cereal
Daddy as bought them because it says they're low in fat
ninety six per cent fat free
that's right
when he bought them you had one in the car „ didn't you
they're a little
they taste to me a little bit like popcorn
but they're rice „ aren't they
rice and cheese circles
very light
very light like popcorn
would you like a drink Thomas
what do you say
that's better
so we've got music time tomorrow „ haven't we
oh we're not going to Didsbury yet
we're going to Didsbury later on
yes
this afternoon we're going to Didsbury
no
we're not going to DidsburyStation
we're going into Didsbury
but then we've got to go back to Didsbury tomorrow for music time in the morning „ haven't we
we're going to a different music class now
oh it's still Julian but you're older now
you're in the three to five year old class now
so it's a longer session „ isn't it
so it doesn't finish now until twelve o'clock
and by the time we've gone into Didsbury and done what we've hadta do there
and got home
it's usually about half past one „ isn't it
we sang that song with Julian about the mittens actually
do your remember that
we've not sung that for a long time „ have we
and then all of a sudden
I don't know whether he remembered about it but he started singing it „ didn't he
I can't quite remember the words but
well I can't
it's something like
but then later on the kittens find the mittens and the Mummy cat says
clever kittens
so we'll hafta see if he does it tomorrow
because we were on holiday from music group „ weren't we
over the EasterHoliday
out of what
oh yes
I know what you're talking about
yes
last time we went to music time we walked
we walked and walked and walked
well we went round the back „ didn't we
you could see
well it isn't the back actually
it's just we took a different route home
we saw those flats
you said they're building a new cottage but it's actually flats
it's where the old theater useta be
do you remember the day we went past and it collapsed a few minutes later
we watched them
didn't they knock the old theater down
and then we watched them dig the foundations
it was all very exciting last Summer
hm
we watched the cement mixer
we watched the digger
we watched all sorts
and then they put lots and lotsof boards round so nobody could see in
and all of a sudden now the boards have gone
and we can actually see what they've done „ can't we
it's not finished yet
but they've got the roof on
they've got the front doors on
the windows are in
excuse me


did you say my cereal has bones in it
don't say belly Thomas
I don't like it
mm
they're quite tasty these „ aren't they
well I'll have a little bite of yours if you have a little bite of mine
oops
well done
and I'll have a little bite of yours
mm nice
so before Easter occasionally we went to the three to five year old class „ didn't we
at music time
but we decided to stick with the two to three year old until after the holidays
because you were only three at the beginning of April
and most of the people that were in the same class as you will be coming into the three to five year old and some are already there
so we'll go tomorrow and see how we get on
do you remember we saw Julian driving away and putting his sunglasses on
well it was a bright day and he was driving and he must have thought sunglasses would improve the way he could see things
do you like these
would you like a piece of cheese with them
just this cheese
I'm having a job to talk while I'm eating this because it's quite dry „ isn't it
oh dear Thomas
poor Purdie's not very well „ is she
she's quite poorly again „ isn't she
Daddy hadta take her to the vet's this morning
we hadta have her there for half past eight in the morning
because they wanna do a blood test and try and find out what's the matter with her
because she as not been a very well pussy cat „ has she
not a well chicken
that's right
either
not a well chicken either
so poor old Purdie
she had a blood test last week „ didn't she
pardon
yes
they sent her home last week
we took her last Thursday „ didn't we
because she wasn't well and they wanted to see her on Friday morning
we hadta leave her
do you remember
and Daddy took her
ooh
first thing in the morning and then we picked her up at six o'clock at night
well they did some tests then
didn't they
oh just then I was reaching a piece of kitchen roll to use as a tissue
and I just caught my arm on the knife block
where the sharp knives are kept
there you are
are you going to look at my elbow and tell me if it's alright
is it cut
oh dear dear
it's only a little scratch
so we picked Purdie up last Friday and they wanna see her „ don't they
every week until things get better
but she hadta go today for a little blood test
but this time it was only one where they just hadta take a little bit of blood from her
they didn't hafta put her to sleep like they did last week
last week they gave her a little injection so she slept a long time
yes
she had a really deep sleep last week so they could have a look at her properly
but today they just wanted to
they put a little needle in her neck „ didn't they
she didn't like it very much „ did she
meow
is that what she said
so we've got to be very gentle
she as got to go back tomorrow night
oops be careful

how about an apple
oh don't bang that because it'll shatter
no Thomas

I think your nose is tickling more because you've just had a little piece of

oh I'm sure Purdie does
Purdie likes all fish you can eat „ doesn't she

I think you like sausage more than Purdie does
yes
Purdie likes custard and she likes fish
I don't think she'd like the two together fish and custard „ would she
what can you see outside
rain
it as gone really warm „ hasn't it
recently
nice and sunny
you've been in shorts „ haven't you
would you like a little bite of this
what are you thinking about
you've gone very quiet

a party or a potty
potty
training pants
Thomas what are you talking about

I really don't know what you're talking about now
I don't think you know what you're talking about either „ do you
do you
would you like another drink Thomas
no thank you
you drank that orange quite quickly „ didn't you
the orange juice you were drinking
you drank it very fast
very quickly
yes
were you thirsty
that's why I'm wondering whether you'd like another drink now
would you like another drink
Thomas
no thank you
oh Purdie what's the matter
come on Puss
here she comes

are you alright sweetheart
here she is
she's a nice girl „ isn't she
I'm not going to pick her up
I'm just going to leave her because I think she needs to be left alone
oh she came „ didn't she
when I did that with my fingers
would you like to get up Puss
oh I thought she'd seen something then because her head moved really quickly
did you see it
what have you seen sweetie
she as eaten quite a lot of food
look at that plate
Purdie's plate
there's only a little bit of food left on it now
she must have been very hungry „ mustn't she
well she's a good girl
are you clapping
it's the band clapping
a what clap
a bandclapper
like a clapper board
is that what you mean
oh right
who as been talking to you about
is it raining very hard
is it not sunshining
oh dear
yes
it's a bit strange now „ isn't it
funny old rain
yes
go away rain
do you know that rhyme
yes
I know
isn't it funny this rain
it as been so nice and warm
it's not „ is it
no
it's not
no
the lid on your sandpit is nice and tight
that's why we we hafta keep the lid shut
because if it suddenly starts to rain or anything happens if the lid's on tight then no water can get in the sand
so when it is a nice sunny afternoon and you wanna play in the sandpit the sand's all lovely and dry and clean
and fresh
ah that's a nice kiss
actually we could read this book because in this book
a FatherChristmasbook
it's a squeaky book
what is it
it's a crocodile
can you see his teeth
and he as got boots on
I was just thinking that's what you need on a wet day „ don't you
shall we read the book
you think so
there you go
look at his big sunglasses
gosh look at the rain outside
that must be a cloud burst
gosh
look at it
the patio's almost flooded
why are you saying shh
so you can listen to the rain
what does the rain say
pitterpatter
is that a nice rainy sound
gosh that's a brightly colored parrot
ah now who's that
a cheeky monkey
he's swinging
what's what darling
it might be a snake do you think
he has „ hasn't he
he's a pink hippo and you can see his tummy button
what else can you see
he as got a little tongue poking out there
the crocodile's sharp teeth „ can you
what do crocodiles do
snap went the crocodile
look
a pink elephant as well
I don't think the snake's on that picture „ is he
do you think there's one more page
do you think there is or do you think that's it
no
I think that's it
did you like that book
you're just going to read it again
which is your favorite one in the book
that's a hippopotamus
a hippo
you liked cheeky monkey as well „ didn't you
shall we do the cheeky monkey song
yes
his tummy button
that hippopotamus is carrying an umbrella „ isn't he
an umbrella
look
this orange and white striped umbrella
because the hippopotamus knows that if the crocodile goes to see the elephant who's going to squirt some water there'll be water everywhere
so hippopotamus has got his umbrella ready so that when he goes to visit the elephant he doesn't get wet
but the crocodile wants to get wet „ doesn't he
because he wants to get his boots wet
so let's have a look
first of all the crocodile is moaning because he can't find his new rubber boots
so he moaned „ didn't he
and then he was fed up because he said
I would like to try my new rubber boots but it's not wet
sighed the crocodile
he sighed
you do that when you're fed up „ don't you
when you're fed up you go „ don't you
that's sighing
now look
that's a very unhappy crocodile
but then he's happy because hippo says he knows how he can get his boots wet
I'm so grateful for your help said the smiling crocodile
and the last page a very happy crocodile
so he as gone from moaning and sighing and being unhappy to being a happy crocodile
to be a smiling and happy crocodile
Tom don't do that
did you enjoy that book
well this is a jigsaw „ isn't it
after your pebbles
your pebbles
have you seen the box with the pebbles in
would you like a look at that
can you not reach it
you've got some on the kitchen window ledge
just let me get this
oh dear
there
look at those
they're not pebbles „ are they
what are they
pebbles
they're pebbles
yes
those are quite small
these are large
do you remember this one
what did we say that looked like
a pear
well yes
it's sort of pear shaped
but it's more egg shaped
did we not say it looked like an ostrich egg
pardon
a snake's egg
yes
we've all these pebbles „ haven't we
Mummy as got a storage box for these
there are some under the kitchen sink in a little plastic box but Mummy uses those for paper weights when I'm working in the garden
when I'm writing in the garden I use those paper weights because Mummy collected those when I was a little girl
I collected them when I was staying on the Isle of Iona which is a very long way away
and they're very special to me and I don't really want them to go missing
so we have those in a special box
but I think we'll put these in another box
perhaps a clear plastic box and then we can see through the box to see what's inside
it is
it is
and we can't see what's in it
it's taking up a lot of room
well Grandma and Grandad collected some pebbles when you were just very young
you know when you first started liking windmills and we bought these little windmills
Mummy put them in a plant pot on the patio table
and we needed something just to wedge them together so Grandma and Grandad went and picked lotsof pebbles from the beach
and then when you've been to the beach you've picked pebbles with them
and you got a lot in your sandpit „ haven't you
and then we've got these that we play with in the house
which is the largest one
this one
it's very heavy „ isn't it
I like this pebble „ don't you
bouncing it up and down gently
so I think when we finally do something different with these stones
I'm sure as you grow up and we don't want the stones
another and another
but I think I would like to keep this one because this will remind me of you when you were a little boy
little tiny one
it is a small one
you're putting it on my shoulder
I'll be able to say
you see this pebble
when my little boy Thomas was a small boy
when he was about three years old he useta play with this
I'll be able to say „ won't I
can you see all the different colors
it's sort of greyie blue speckled
it looks a bit speckled like an egg
and it as got thin lines running through
it's almost a silvery tinge
can you see that sparkly silvery
it's not paid „ is it
no
not
who's not paid
there are lotsof bluey grey ones and look
some darker grey
look at these
look at that one
that's pink
what colors can you see in that one
that looks almost like
oh it's paid
oh I see
oh right
are you a pebble shopman
ah right
I tell you what
I'll go and get my purse
get the purse with the toy money in
how's that
yes please
that's a big large one
I will be careful with that
I tell you what
I'll take that because I think that reminds me of an egg
I think that would look nice on the window ledge „ wouldn't it
how much do I owe you MisterPebbleman
two pounds
gosh yes
it is quite a large egg
there you are
those are pound coins
one pound
two pounds
thank you very much
I don't need any change because that's exactly the right money
thank you
is it a till
you're pretending that's a till „ are you
okay
oh now I've paid for that very large egg
I wonder if you have a very small pebble
a small stone
out of all those it's the smallest
you clever boy
you have
but I think I'll just take this small one
can you feel how smooth that one is „ MisterPebbleman
you feel that
it's shiny and smooth
now the large one that I bought
it's still nice to touch but it's a lot rougher „ isn't it
than that one
it does „ doesn't it
it feels like it as got a shiny smooth coating like Smartie
right
how much do I owe you for this small one MisterPebbleman
lotsof pounds
oh come on
the big one was only two pounds so I can't owe you lotsof pounds for this
you need two pounds
oh fair enough
oh dear
I don't think I've got two pounds
I've got two fifty pences
that's one pound
I've got some twenty pences here

and two ten pences

oh that's a shame
MisterPebbleman what could I buy for twenty two pence please

I keep buying pebbles you see because I like them on my kitchen window ledge
I look at them

and how much is that one
oh oops a daisy

six pounds

well I tell you what MisterPebbleman
I've been walking on the beach with Grandma and Grandad
and I've collected all these pebbles
now if I give you all these pebbles
one two three four five six seven eight pebbles
if I put those eight pebbles there could I give you those to sell in your shop
and whatever money you make from selling them you can keep it in your till
but I'll take this pebble for free because I can't afford eight pounds
but you'll get more than eight pounds for these eight pebbles „ won't you
okay
thank you MisterPebbleman
these that I've just brought in for free
oh go on then
you have polished them up
you've cleaned them up since I brought them in „ haven't you
this one looks like a piece of chocolate again
I though I'd brought that one
perhaps it's another one
this is a very light one
it's most unusual
thank you
they're nice colors „ aren't they
oh thank you
how much is this pebble
that's a beautiful oval shape
look at that
one pence
oh there's five pence
can I have four pennys change please
if you have five and you take one off you have four left
one two three four
what do I owe you
well you owe me four pence please because you said the stone cost a penny and I gave you five pence
oops
we're a bit hopeless between us „ aren't we
dropping pebbles
dropping money
oh thank you
you've actually given me one pound and five pence
I'm going to go while I'm ahead
thank you very much MisterPebbleman
I shall see you again
can I have a kiss before I go
I'll see you next Thursday
oh
you're shuting the shop now „ are you
is that the shutters going down
oh well I'm on my way home to have some tea
right
I've actually come in a little truck this time
I bet I could
I could
do you remember we bought that little train set last Summer „ didn't we
well in a shop somewhere in Stockport
oh your slide and swing
yes
but the slide was for your second birthday „ wasn't it
from Grandma Lastname
and Grandma and GrandadBeilbie bought you a swing oh a long time ago
before you were two
they bought it because they came to stay with us and they'd had a nice time

a B and Q lorry
that looks like those P and O ferry train carriages we see on BurnageStation
you know the train goes past with a truck
doesn't it
there's my purse
thank you
oops you're playing with T N T lorry „ are you
it's the train carriage
gosh there's a lot
I shall hafta take them out in different loads because I can't carry them
well the Pebbleman
yes
I do need help
gosh that's a big one
thank you
this is the one we dropped on the floor so I'll pick that one as well
anyway we were talking about your swing
Grandma and GrandadBeilbie came to stay with us „ didn't they
when you were about one and half years old
and they had a nice stay and they said they wanted to buy something
for you
that would remind you of them
so they bought the swing
Grandma and Grandad Lastname bought the slide and Grandma and GrandadBeilbie bought the swing
oh listen
I can hear a train now
do you think that's the train carrying the pebbles

now shall I move the train nearer to you
shall I help you load the pebbles
one two three
five
seven
eight nine twelve
and then
what happened to ten and eleven
oh bye bye
bye bye
oh right
shall I unload them
look
we can build a little tower „ couldn't we
the man's taking two
we could make a pyramid
they don't stack as well as bricks but
is it
this is like doing a dry stone wall
do you remember
when you watched Teletubbies once
there was a
do you remember the two little boys on the farm
one was called Matthew
and their Daddy kept sheep
I think it was a farm in Cumbria
and I think they
some of the sheep had escaped through a hole in the wall and the little boys went with their Daddy who was the farmer to help him build the dry stone wall
and this is what a dry stone wall is Thomas
there's no cement like there is when you're bricks together like a house
it's just a formation of stones and rocks building up a big wall like that
GrandadBeilbie as done dry stone walling
you see a lot of dry stone walls in Yorkshire
you want me to help you take the stones out of the passenger lorry
let's pop them there
oh look
can you see how this wall's building up now
isn't this clever
yes
look
that one would stop you getting through „ wouldn't it
wow
are you going to put these two fancy colored ones there
oh there's that very big egg shaped one there
look at it now
the sun's shining beautifully
I can't get over this
it was raining so hard a few minutes ago „ wasn't it
there we are
we've used all the stones to make a stone wall
now look at that
„ isn't it
there I think we've done a good job
oh dear
oh dear
what as happened
a crash
has the truck run into the stones
