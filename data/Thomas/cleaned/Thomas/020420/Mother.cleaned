the garden looks better today „ doesn't it
we were busy in the garden „ weren't we
last night
me and you
we put two new hanging baskets at the front
and some of the plants that we ad had sitting in a pot in the garden at the back
we planted last night „ didn't we
at the front
because some of the tubs at the front that ad had pansys in were looking a bit pathetic now „ weren't they
pardon
are you talking about cutting your nails
oh I know what you're talking about
no
I had some red handled scissors outside
and I was cutting back a lot of the dead things last night „ wasn't I
the lid off
yes
well you
the leaves off
that's right
you were helping „ weren't you
leaves off
we were deadheading a lot of flowers
a red truck
and I was cutting back a lot of things with the red scissors „ wasn't I
we were doing a lot of jobs „ weren't we
and we took all the dead pansys out of the soil
and we turned it over with a fork
and put fresh soil in
and then we planted some plants
but unfortunately the plants we planted aren't going to last many weeks
in pots
you stacked up all the empty pots
because there were some bedding plants that Granddad gave us a couple of weeks ago
and we had them standing at the back
but they're not going to last many weeks
and we put them at the front
and we put the tortoise outside as well „ didn't we
two hanging baskets
and two tubs we did yesterday
and we deadheaded flowers
and we swept
didn't we sweep the patio
and we cleaned all the garden furniture
all the chairs
and the table
and Mummy scrubbed the stone
we washed the slide and the swing
we cleaned the dustbin
and you played in your sand pit
the green sand pit
that's right
who came to see you
yesterday lunch time
Liz
Liz came
we all sat outside
and had lunch together „ didn't we
yes
Liz has a white car „ doesn't she
do you like this
in fact next week or perhaps the end of this week we're going to see Liz
because she lives near a park „ doesn't she
and she said if we go to her house she'll make some sandwiches
and we can go to the park
and have lunch in the park
because she's on holiday at the moment
and Liz is useta looking after children
because she's a teacher
but she doesn't have them really when they're quite as young as you
you like playing with that car that Granddad bought you „ don't you
big high up
you're lifting it high above your head
I don't know whether you can see Purdie outside Thomas
but she's washing her face
is she watching Felix through the bottom of the fence
there's a tiny gap „ isn't there
where the fence doesn't quite meet the brick wall
jump it
yes
Felix and Molly and Tiddles tend to jump on the fence
but Purdie doesn't now
she useta when we first moved here
but I think she's a bit old now
but Purdie likes to sit on the patio
and stare through that little crack in the fence
and she can see what the other pussy cats are doing „ can't she
I don't think they realize they're being watched
oh
she's quite crafty „ isn't she

oh
I don't think you should go round saying things like that though
that's something private
Purdie as got a big nose
and Mummy as got a big nose
oh it's not nice going round telling people they've big noses either
oh well that's alright if you're saying you've got a big nose
