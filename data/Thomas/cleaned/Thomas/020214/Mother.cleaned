we've had a busy day because we got up had breakfast and you got dressed in these smart trousers and a smart shirt and a waistcoat and a bowtie that you wore for on your second birthday
and we drove to the wedding
and you went to your first wedding
and then at the reception you were absolutely fantastic because you sat in the highchair ate sausages chips and icecream
I've never had sausages chips and icecream at a wedding before
Mummy didn't have that „ did she
but Thomas did
a special meal for a special boy
and you played with your train „ didn't you
you put chips and sausage in the train
and you met a little girl called Sarah
you were playing with Sarah

Sarah
Sarah was four and Thomas is two
and she had a Barbie teeshirt on
not at the wedding but before she came home she changed into a Barbie teeshirt „ didn't she
and what were you doing
you were running round the grounds

and then we came back we saw Sue next door
and you were giving Sue flowers from the garden „ weren't you

which has melted all over your nice shirt
and Mummy's suit as got icecream and chocolate on it
and do you remember the manager
when the manager wanted to tell us that the speeches were
yes
the manager took that wooden hammer and he went bang bang bang bang on the table „ didn't he
and he asked you to bang it and you wouldn't bang it would you
but a few minutes into the speeches you decided to bang the table „ didn't you
and frightened everybody to death because the cutlery went oop up in the air
and everybody laughed
and the manager came and said you wouldn't do that when I wanted you to
but apart from that you were a very good boy
and you weren't even being a naughty boy then
you were just banging the table a bit later than we wanted you to

I can only think that perhaps when you were going to the chip shop with Grandma and Grandad that Nana bumped her head „ did she
I know that yesterday when Grandma and Grandad were babysitting you you went to the fish and chip shop
because they bought fish and chips for lunch
and Grandma said quick quick let's hurry home because the chips are hot and we needta get home before they go cold
quick quick hurry hurry we're in a rush
is that what Grandma said
because she told me that you'd had chips for your lunch
and then today at the wedding you had sausages and chips again
that was chips twice this week Tom
what a lucky boy

what would you like more of
more
well there's a little bit more in the box look
that's the box that the pasta salad was in
your dish isn't empty but if you'd like to eat it straight from the box I don't mind

and you had a little sleep coming home in the car but Mummy hasn't had a sleep
oh be careful
be careful
don't Thomas

don't put all four fingers in your mouth at once because if you put it too far back
did you say something about your friend

you're going to make yourself sick
oh dear you've dropped the juice now
the juice is on the floor with pasta salad
shall Mummy pick it up
I beg your pardon
what do you say

and get a cloth and wipe the floor
and then I'll give you a clean teaspoon
there's quite a mess on the floor „ isn't there
oh I think there is
we'll hafta throw this little bit away Thomas because we've been walking on the carpet a lot today
coming in from the garden
and Purdie as been in and out
I don't think it would be very nice to eat it „ do you when it as been on the floor
let's throw it away now
let Mummy get you a different teaspoon
you had a spoon but you can't have that one because that as been on the floor
there you are
yes

oh you've put your slice of orange bread on the teaspoon as well
that's interesting
the orange bread is nice „ isn't it
yes
oh no don't drop them all on the floor Thomas
that's not being a good boy „ is it

is it hurting
because you keep putting your hands in
I don't like you putting your hands so far back

and in the shadow I can see the windmills going round and round
I can look at the windmills and watch them going round and I can look at the fence and see the shadow of the windmills going round and round
nightnight NinNin
does NinNin look tired
what're you doing
you're giving me that silly face that you gave the photographer

because Daddy's at work and Mummy has some things to do
oh dear have you dropped the juice again
is Thomas tired
oops and the glass have fallen off
I think you must be very tired because you're very quiet
are you saying shush because this morning during the service a little girl was sitting next to us and when Linda and Brian were saying their vows she was saying shush to you so that you wouldn't talk
you were very good
pardon
Sarah
Sarah
did you share a chair with Sarah
there was Mummy and Daddy and a chair in between us that you and Sarah sat on during the service
and you were looking at your book and drinking some milk
but then when it came to the meal time you actually had a chair all on your own „ didn't you
a big highchair with a nice red tray
or perhaps it was a yellow and blue highchair with a nice yellow tray
you'd like your trains
no I'm talking about sitting in the highchair

there we are

think Daddy might have gone to sleep upstairs because he's very quiet
he was doing some work on his computer
and he said when he'd finished that he was going to read a paper
it as become very quiet upstairs
he was probably starting to read his newspaper and then fallen asleep
