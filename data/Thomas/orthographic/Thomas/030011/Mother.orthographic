gently . 
so after we (h)ad been to music lesson we went into that shop in Didsbury and bought a flag „ didn't we ? 
in Didsbury . 
the shop in Didsbury . 
your flag .

Mummy folded it up . 
just rolled it up so it doesn't spoil . 
I rolled it round the <little flag part> [>] .

that's right . 
after you (h)ad waved your flag at the train we saw another one on the bridge „ didn't we ? 
did we go <to see> [//] to meet some [//] Ben and Charlotte's Daddy from work ? 
poor Ben . 
I know .

and when Daddy got off (.) Ben and Charlotte hadta come home with [/] with their Mummy and Daddy . 
but we decided to stay . 
because we (h)ad gone to look at the trains really „ hadn't we ? 
Ben and Charlotte had just come with us because that's what we were going to do . 
and Ben didn't wanna go home with his Daddy „ did he ? 
he wanted to stay with us . 
I suppose really we should have said he could have stayed (.) but I don't know whether I could have coped with two little boys . 
do you think I could have managed ? 
would you have been good little boys ? 
oh thank you . 
this is mint again .

and you got something else as well . 
and do you know (.) you never said a word . 
you knew you (h)ad already got them „ didn't you ? 
and you just said “thank you very much” . 
you were so polite . 
so [<] +... [+ IN] 
Alice is barking ? 
that must mean somebody's coming . 
so (.) Mummy (h)as been to the shop +/. [+ IN] 
William's wish Wellingtons . 
listen . 
Mummy went to the shop . 
and she (h)as exchanged some of your parcels . 
so [<] nobody need know . 
that what they bought you (.) you (h)ad already got . 
it's not everybody . 
you got lots_of nice things that you haven't got . 
and [<] we bought you +... [+ IN] 
you've had a Bob_the_Builder plate and bowl . 
this new fire engine . 
which you haven't seen because Mummy hid this „ didn't she ? 
and what else did you get ? 
oh your policeman's helmet ! 
and your ambulance . 
and we got all those things in exchange for presents that you (h)ad <already got> [>] . 
yes . 
now this fire engine +... [+ IN] 
<was there> [//] <is there a lion on the television> [>] ? 
this fire engine isn't like the one that makes a noise . 
it's a Duplais lego land . 
or lego Duplais . 
and you've got all sorts of other bits and pieces „ haven't you ? 
you've got diggers and trains and all sorts . 
so you can put all the lego pieces together . 
shall we open the box ? 
right . 
this is exciting „ isn't it ? 
oh look . 
there's the picture (.) on the box of what the firemen's doing . 
we needta open this little bag (.) which contains +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
some more lego bags . 
<fire engine's> [<] ready to set off ? 
right . 
what's on the back there ? 
looks like they've built something . 
<oh look> [<] . 
this must be a water (..) cannister , Thomas . 
look at this . 
isn't this fantastic ? 
look . 
a water pump . 
and that's his hose . 
whoosh [/] whoosh . 
there's the fire . 
look . 
I bet the hose goes in the fireman's hand „ don't you ? 
isn't there ? 
oh that makes a change „ doesn't it ? 
now how does this go ? 
that's right . 
a fire engine's siren . 
&=laughs . 
it doesn't come with sound but you'll supply the sound „ won't you ? 
is this a nice present ? 
they were nice presents anyway , Thomas „ weren't they ? 
that people bought you . 
I mean there were some beautiful [/] beautiful things . 
you were such a lucky boy . 
but there's no point having two of the same thing „ is there ? 
&-um (.) I tell you what . 
we must try and remember to get our thank you letters out this week end . 
we've been a bit naughty „ haven't we ? 
not sending thank you letters . 
have you ? 
<look (.) who's this> [<] ? 
a pussy cat ? 
it was a little dog . 
he (h)as all sorts of things on his fire engine „ hasn't he ? 
did [<] you put that there ? 
that's very clever . 
that's the elevator „ isn't it ? 
we seem to have a spare lego brick . 
where do you think that needs to go ? 
there ? 
can you see all these dials and clocks and things there look ? 
that must be the water pressure . 
I don't know what that is . 
it's alright . 
it hasn't broken . 
the hose just clips on there . 
the fireman can stand in there . 
look . 
and go up on his ladder . 
look at that . 
oops . 
&=laughs [>] . 
oh isn't that super ? 
don't you ? 
you knew where the lights were „ didn't you ? 
straight away . 
you clever . 
it looks as if the hosepipe might go through there (.) look (.) as well . 
look at that . 
if you'd like it to go on the top it'll go on the top perfectly . 
it might just fit on there like that . 
do you think we've put that on the right place ? 
do you need the fire [//] fireman now ? 
look at this . 
he's a smart fireman . 
he (h)as got a white helmet as well . 
don't you ? 
well how does the fire engine run without the fire man ? 
it's a building ? 
scaffolding . 
oh it (h)as come with a little booklet as well , Thomas . 
because you've got quite a few lego bits now . 
bits and pieces „ haven't you ? 
is it ? 
what's on fire ? 
Mummy is ? 
oh look . 
they do a lego police station , Thomas . 
look . 
with the police helicopter they've got the same black dog . 
the same dog that you've got now with your (..) <fire engine> [>] . 
there's the racing car . 
you've got that already „ haven't you ? 
look at that little dumper truck . 
that's rather nice „ isn't it ? 
and there's a man there like the man that you're missing . 
is that the sound of the water coming out of the hose ? 
whoosh . 
is that all you're going to say ? 
I think Daddy would quite enjoy playing with this „ don't you ? 
is it difficult ? 
no . 
you haven't . 
you've got a police car though „ haven't you ? 
I'm not quite sure what that lego brick there is for . 
we can't see the other side . 
perhaps it's just a spare brick . 
ah . 
now . 
this is interesting , Thomas . 
look [<] . 
because (.) look (.) on this picture the fireman (h)as got this here . 
no [/] no . 
that's the wonderful thing about this lego . 
you can do so many different things with it „ can't you ? 
look at this now . 
that goes round there . 
so if <the fire> [//] the fireman needs to rescue a pussy cat from the tree . 
look he can go dum_de_dum_de_dum_de_dum@o . 
he can go all the way up his ladder . 
like this . 
I think he needs his legs straight . 
but <his arms> [/] his arms needta go up . 
he can come down again . 
yes . 
can he ? 
a fish ? 
he (h)as rescued a fish „ has he ? 
&=laughs [<] . 
where (h)as he rescued a fish from ? 
where was the fish stuck ? 
that's a funny thing . 
the fish was stuck in some chocolate buttons on the roof ? 
now (.) look what the fireman's doing now . 
look . 
he's right at the top of his ladder with his hosepipe . 
does that still fit on there ? 
yes ? 
&=laughs . 
this is lovely „ isn't it ? 
well look . 
the fireman's up the ladder and what he doesn't know is who (h)as got into the fire engine ! 
who (h)as got into the fire engine ? 
is he ? 
<oh no> [>] . 
&=laughs . 
poor fireman fell off „ didn't he ? 
no . 
where shall we put +... [+ IN] 
shall we move that up a little bit ? 
if we move that there +... [+ IN] 
Granddad and Grandma have taken it apart . 
you've got the lego <digger that Grandma bought you> [>] . 
there's a hook . 
that's right . 
I bet your train would clip onto that back of that or your digger . 
the new digger that you got for your birthday . 
do you think that would hook on the back ? 
you think so . 
no trains ? 
what would you like ? 
the little train with the horse ? 
and the digger . 
I'll get them for you , love . 
the little lego train is in there with all the lego bricks . 
look . 
and the racing car . 
there's the train . 
right . 
you take that . 
the carriage . 
lots and lots_of things now . 
oh is the train pulling the fire engine ? 
it's good „ isn't it ? 
we could clip (.) that onto there and that onto there . 
who's pulling who ? 
is the fire engine pulling the train with the horse and trailer ? 
or is the train pulling the fire engine ? 
oh ! 
this is Howdy . 
look who's stuck up here . 
a pussy cat . 
do you think the fireman could have gone 0 [=! makes noise] and rescued her ? 
Thomas is rescuing her ? 
does that go on the front ? 
Mummy doesn't know . 
could you show me please ? 
oh I don't think it goes there . 
oh there ? 
right . 
that little lego train though , Thomas , hasta be the best thing that you've ever been given (.) I think . 
doesn't it ? 
<you played> [<] with that train for hours and hours and hours . 
oh thank you . 
that's good „ isn't it ? 
and we could put some bricks in the back there „ can't we ? 
you needta move those things ? 
would you be happier on the floor do you think ? 
might be a little bit more room on the floor . 
but if you look at the box and look at the picture on the box there're all sorts of different things you can do with it „ isn't there ? 
the hosepipe (.) seems to go round [/] (.) round here like this . 
look at all the hosepipe . 
this must be how the fireman (.) carrying the hose to a fire . 
oops a daisy . 
trouble is , Thomas , when you're very engrossed in something like this (.) you don't really say a lot „ do you ? 
you're so busy watching and looking . 
what have you found ? 
a fireman ? 
well there was a big bang then . 
did you hear the big bang and Alice started to bark . 
I don't know what happened . 
oops a daisy . 
are you +//. [+ IN] 
&=laughs . 
you've got your foot stuck in the bag that the lego came in . 
can you see now that the hose is on the back of the fire engine ? 
the little dog wants to go for a ride on your train . 
is there room ? 
yes . 
so what's happening to the horse ? 
is the horse having to walk ? 
wonder what all these little controls are , Thomas , on the (.) fire engine . 
what do you think they do ? 
that makes a lovely noise „ doesn't it ? 
clickity_click@o . 
where's the train going to , Thomas ? 
going to where ? 
going to Cheshire ? 
oh we live in Cheshire [>] . 
going to Stockport [>] . 
where's it going , love ? 
it's going to cabbage ? 
you thought that noise was a poo ? 
what noise ? 
is it ? 
well if you say so . 
I think there's some building bricks in the back of the digger . 
you can build a wall with those „ can't you ? 
a big high up wall . 
a tall wall . 
a tower . 
that's a good name for a (.) high building „ isn't it ? 
a tower . 
is it ? 
oh yes . 
it's almost going as quickly as the fire engine . 
is it hiding ? 
hiding from the dustbin men ? 
&=laughs . 
why is the train hiding from the dustbin men , Thomas ? 
oh you +//. [+ IN] 
oh right . 
has it been to a big bang ? 
did you have a nice time at the station when we went ? 
well I think that's the water pump . 
look we've got the hosepipes . 
and when they get to the fire they needta get a good supply of water „ don't they ? 
I'm having an awful job of lifting that off there . 
I can't get it off , Thomas . 
more like a cheese ? 
it's more like a thin slice of cheese „ isn't it ? 
do you ? 
you need another polo ? 
go on . 
I'll give you a polo <seeing as they're still here> [>] . 
what do you say ? 
yes please . 
polo coming up in the back of the dumper truck . 
you've got to find it before you can have it . 
thank you , dumper truck . 
that's quite alright . 
you love me ? 
oh <you love the digger> [>] . 
you love my hair ? 
my hair probably looks a bit of a mess today , Thomas . 
well whenever we go too +... [+ IN] 
I was going to say bang^a^drum^time@c but you don't like that . 
you like music lessons „ don't you ? 
when we go to music lessons (.) one of the things that Julian has us doing right at the end +... [+ IN] 
+, is you hafta lie down and listen to a piece of classical music . 
but when I lie down (.) you always grab my hair „ don't you ? 
and pull my hair . 
like a baby . 
oh yes . 
you useta do that all the time when you were a baby . 
Mummy's hair was your comfort blanket „ wasn't it ? 
mhm . 
oh yes . 
well they're chocolate buttons „ aren't they ? 
I don't know what's happening . 
there's a funny sort of bird on the television . 
like a (.) &-um [//] oh I don't know what you call it . 
a cockatoo or something like that . 
do you know what it's necklace is made from , Thomas ? 
you know those buttons you can buy from the Early_Learning_Centre where you thread them with &-um (.) cotton ? 
the birds wearing a necklace made from those buttons . 
and it's sposta be <counting out some money> [>] . 
pardon ? 
what about Didsbury station ? 
oh the wool on the railway track . 
that's right . 
yes . 
we had a look at the train track „ didn't we ? 
and somebody dropped a glove . 
and there was some wool „ wasn't there ? 
we saw a pussy cat crossing the train line . 
it's a good job there wasn't a train coming at the time „ isn't it ? 
no . 
no more polos , Thomas . 
no [/] no . 
no . 
I don't think so . 
you think so (.) yes ? 
no , Thomas . 
is there anything we've missed off from this ? 
now do you think the fire engine looks ready to go now to an emergency ? 
we could always put that brick there „ couldn't we ? 
that's perhaps where the little dog could sit . 
where's the dog ? 
oh I think he's under +//. [+ IN] 
don't +//. [+ IN] 
going on the train „ hasn't he ? 
on your little lego train . 
have you not hidden the dog ? 
there we are . 
his ladders are ready . 
his lights are on . 
his hose is at the back . 
I suppose he must take that with him when he goes „ mustn't he ? 
<are you now> [<] ? 
you're having another polo instead ? 
instead of what ? 
oh [=! laughs] . 
while I'm getting the fire engine ready you're making a polo . 
no . 
I'll get you another one . 
let me help you [>] . 
that's it now . 
they're going away . 
it's not good to have a lot of things like that . 
this is some more lego . 
I think it was a xxx blue brick that came with the digger „ wasn't it ? [+ PI] 
pardon ? 
sorry ? 
oh the nee_nas@o are off . 
yes . 
they don't flash I'm afraid (.) those lights „ do they ? 
look these are some more lego bricks that we got one day . 
I think that was from Macdonalds „ wasn't it ? 
do you remember ? 
you putting the pussy cat +//. [+ IN] 
there we are . 
that's a little cockerel „ isn't it ? 
cock^a^doodle^doo@o . 
meow [/] meow . 
get me down . 
is that what you said ? 
the pussy cat sitting on top of the cockerel's head ? 
you've rescued her . 
look the firemen +/. [+ IN] 
is it ? 
it is actually . 
yes . 
the lego cat's called Purdie . 
oh don't let the fire engine run the pussy cat over . 
stop fire engine . 
stop . 
it's very near the pussy cat „ isn't it ? 
look . 
the digger's coming to scoop the pussy cat safely out of the way of the fire engine . 
up you go . 
up you go , pussy cat . 
and down . 
ah . 
it was being lifted up and down by the digger „ was it ? 
it is rather like a lift that „ isn't it ? 
when we get in the lift which buttons do we press ? 
several buttons ? 
did you say several buttons ? 
that's very clever . 
yes . 
there <are several buttons> [>] . 
oh ! 
pussy cat (h)as &=laughs jumped on the fireman's ladders ? 
<the ladder's &-uh> [//] (.) the fireman's going to get a big surprise „ isn't he „ when he stops and looks at his ladders . 
it (h)as jumped straight into my arms . 
hello , pussy cat . 
what's the pussy cat doing ? 
purring ? 
purr^purr@o . 
like that . 
ah that's the sign of a contented pussy cat „ isn't it ? 
pussy cat (h)as jumped onto the wall now . 
get me down . 
oh well done , Thomas . 
you've rescued the pussy cat again . 
isn't it a naughty pussy cat ? 
it's always running away . 
oh ! 
oh no ! 
it (h)as jumped on top of the cockerel's head . 
Thomas has rescued it again . 
hello , pussy cat . 
right . 
I'm just going to get a saucer of milk for pussy cat . 
you be a good pussy cat . 
oh ! 
he (h)as got on the back of the racing car ! 
it's near the fire engine ? 
it's having a nice time „ is it ? 
the pussy cat ? 
is it having a really lovely time with the fireman and fireman's ladders ? 
Thomas [>] +/. [+ IN] 
<can you see> [//] did you just say +//. [+ IN] 
oh look ! 
on the television . 
what's that ? 
is the fire engine near the pussy cat's tail ? 
look . 
it's a kangaroo on television like this Kanga . 
oh . 
&=laughs . 
ah and look there are some piglets on television there . 
drinking milk from their Mummy pig . 
did you notice some [//] on the television the baby kangaroo +/. [+ IN] 
+, was sitting (.) in the pouch (.) of the Mummy kangaroo . 
oh and who's that now ? 
oh . 
the pussy cat (h)as jumped on Mummy's other arm ? 
hello &fi +/. [+ IN] 
hello , fireman , how are you ? 
fine ? 
guess [<] what , fireman ? 
I've got a real problem . 
I've got this pussy cat that keeps getting in your way and jumping everywhere . 
&-um (.) would you like to take the pussy cat home ? 
of course . 
where shall we put her ? 
in the middle of the road ? 
oh that's not looking after a pussy cat „ is it ? 
putting it in the middle of the road . 
he (h)as put the pussy cat on his ladders and he's turning the fire engine around . 
I thought perhaps the fireman would like to take the pussy cat home . 
to look after it at home . 
or could it go and live at the fire station ? 
and then all the firemen would have a pussy cat because the fire station's open all through the day and all through the night „ isn't it ? 
because if the pussy cat got to know all the firemen (.) it would have a lot of people to take care of it . 
and then perhaps when there was a fire the pussy cat could go and along as well . 
check everything's alright . 
oh the pussy cat's on my head . 
&=laughs . 
no . 
it's on your head . 
&=laughs . 
oh . 
now Kangaroo keeps bouncing . 
you'd like to do it ? 
oh . 
the little Tigger doesn't make +//. [+ IN] 
Thomas ! 
be careful . 
I don't think he jumped [//] bounced that far . 
where's the Tigger ? 
the Tigger's more a sort of boing^boing@c <noise „ isn't it> [>] ? 
up in the sky . 
<the wonderful thing about Tiggers> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
<is Tiggers are wonderful things> [=! singing] . [+ R]

<one of the most wonderful thing about Tigger is I'm the only one> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
I know you did . 
you got some crayons the other day and you crayoned <on top of the> [//] <on well> [//] underneath the table . 
<it is> [<] your play table not [/] not Mummy's and Daddy's table . 
but you've still got to look after things xxx . [+ PI] 
<because little piece of> [<] +... [+ IN] 
you're going under the table „ are you now ?

it was just a car driving past . 
oh now look at the television . 
there's pussy cat with some kittens . 
oh look ! 
oh look at the kittens with their Mummy . 
there's some Sellotape on your table because I was using this table the day we were wrapping Pass_the_Parcel presents . 
do you remember ? 
we (.) wrapped them up on this little table „ didn't we ? 
together . 
that's it . 
it's some sticky tape . 
can you pull it off ? 
can't ? 
shall we do it together ? 
oh perhaps it's a job for the fireman . 
I don't think you will actually , Thomas . 
I think I've hidden them . 
look at the hippopotamus now on the television . 
ah and the baby elephant . 
it's obviously a program about big animals and their babies . 
yes . 
it's a tiny elephant „ isn't it ? 
they're otters . 
where are the polos ? 
they've just disappeared . 
<I gave them> [<] to the fireman because he (h)ad done such a good job (.) putting out the fireman (.) that I gave him some . 
I gave the train driver some and I gave the digger driver some . 
and I gave the racing car driver some . 
and that was it . 
by the time all those people had had them (.) there were none left . 
you [<] need some . 
oh no . 
I don't think so . 
you've had +/. [+ IN] 
you've had three polo mints . 
<no no> [/] no . 
no more . 
would you like to put that little bit of sticky tape in the dustbin please for Mummy . 
no . 
not on the chair . 
we've just taken it off the table . 
if you put it on the chair (.) somebody's going to sit on it „ aren't they ? 
talking of which +//. [+ IN] 
oh look at the swan ! 
sitting on her nest . 
I haven't got the polos , darling . 
no . 
the polos have gone away . 
no . 
they're not round my back . 
they've gone . 
look [<] . 
can you see they flying ducks now ? 
we see ducks flying over here „ don't we ? 
well they're Canada geese fly . 
that's when they're leaving the pond . 
they fly like that „ don't they ? 
oh where [/] where ?

Mummy's on fire .
