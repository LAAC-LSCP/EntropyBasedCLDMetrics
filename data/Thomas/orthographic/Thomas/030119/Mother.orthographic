I'm sorry I couldn't tell what you said then .

right . 
if you've finished with that move it back please . 
otherwise you'll knock it on the floor . 
we had some of Rachel's birthday cake on Saturday „ didn't we ? 
and then there was some more today . 
and Jonathan went to bed „ didn't he ? 
because he's only a baby . 
he needs some sleep . 
when you +//. [+ IN] 
do you not remember ? 
this time last year you were going to sleep in the afternoon .

that's the second time that microphone (h)as become unstable „ isn't it ? 
you know that „ do you ? 
right . 
I don't think you should have your drink like this . 
you spill it too much „ don't you ? 
I think you're better with a beaker with a lid on „ don't you ? 
we'll stay as we are for now . 
it's not worth putting a lid on now . 
but another time +//. [+ IN] 
see that is why I serve water in these . 
because if it's just water you spill it doesn't matter . 
but if it's orange juice it's very sticky everywhere „ isn't it ? 
pardon ? 
Rachel was crying about her bed ? 
yes ? 
well she was pretending that she +//. [+ IN] 
ah she was . 
yes . 
she wanted to make a bed „ didn't she ? 
out of a storage box . 
and her Mummy was telling her to get off it because it would break . 
but then she said she could make a bed on the sofa . 
so she fetched a pillow and a duvet cover „ didn't she ? 
that's right . 
she didn't want what she was given . 
she wanted something else „ didn't she ? 
and she said you were making too much noise for her to sleep . 
she's a nice little girl , Rachel „ isn't she ? 
what's Rachel's best friend called ? 
nothing ? 
how about James ? 
do you remember seeing James ? 
at the party on Saturday ? 
it was Rachel's birthday and Rachel's party . 
but James had a birthday as well . 
so after we (h)ad sung happy birthday to Rachel we sang it to James as well „ didn't we ? 
and how old are Rachel and James ? 
sixteen years old ? 
mhm . 
I think they were both four „ weren't they ? 
that's a year older than you . 
no . 
because you're just breaking it , Thomas . 
you're cracking the beaker . 
it's only xxx . [+ PI] 
if you snap it we can't use it again „ can we ?

but these before the fall on the floor . 
you're asleep ? 
you're tired „ aren't you ? 
well you walked home from Didsbury „ didn't you ? 
we took the bus down there because it looked like it was going to rain . 
and you walked from the bus stop through Didsbury park to their house . 
and you've played this afternoon . 
and then you walked all the way home . 
what did we see on the way home ? 
as we walked up Carswell_Drove what did you see ? 
well we stopped to watch some boys playing cricket „ didn't we ? 
at the school . 
that's [>] . 
that's right . 
and while we were watching the cricket players we saw two trains „ didn't we ? 
that's right . 
one with two carriages came that way quite slowly „ didn't it ? 
and another one went very fast . 
it had a lot of carriages „ didn't it ? 
you think it was an express train ? 
and what did it say as it went through ? 
poop poop . 
poop poop . 
and then we walked past Michael's shop „ didn't we ? 
it was closed because he closes on Monday . 
well because he opens on Saturday . 
he opens very late actually . 
Michael works Tuesday (.) Wednesday (.) Thursday (.) Friday and Saturday . 
yes . 
Mary his wife works with him . 
but Thursday (.) Friday and Saturday nights they seem to open quite late „ don't they ? 
on a Friday you can go past at ten o'clock at night and see Michael busy in his shop . 
so I think he has Monday off . 
and in fact when we went to Alison's house (.) we saw Michael and Mary's car parked outside . 
because what did you say about the car ? 
you think Michael was there ? 
you said to me “I think Mary (h)as parked there” . 
it was a very grown up thing to say „ wasn't it ? 
when you saw the car . 
+" I think Mary (h)as parked there . 
well yes . 
I'm sure it could have been Michael as well because they share a car „ don't they ? 
it's Michael and Mary's car . 
and when we went to Alison (.) Rachel and Jonathan's house . 
we could see where Jake_Kelly lived „ couldn't we ? 
mhm . 
we saw their blue car „ didn't we ? 
that big <Cherokee thing> [>] .

we've had sausage (.) <bacon pasta and vegetables „ haven't we> [>] ? 
your voice still sounds funny . 
I don't know what's the matter with you . 
you keep getting better and then it starts up again . 
do you feel poorly , Thomas ? 
let me just feel . 
you want a sweetie to cheer my up ? 
well you always want a sweetie to cheer my up „ don't you ?

oh yes . 
their outside light (h)as come on .

her name's Sandra . 
what's the what , love ? 
boy called ? 
well no he's [//] she's a child minder so she looks after lots_of children . 
they're not her little boys and girls they're other people's little boys and girls who go to play with her during the day . 
she looks after them . 
and she takes some children to the toddler group we're going to tomorrow morning . 
and she also takes a little boy and girl to nursery at Mersey_Vale which is where you're going to in Heaton_Mersey . 
Daddy's home ?

the bus . 
that was exciting „ wasn't it ? 
as we left home . 
what [//] what's this about a man eating crisps ? 
you've told me this before but +/. [+ IN] 
was he ? 
the driver of the bus ? 
was he eating crisps ?

his light came on ? 
his light comed on ?

he was pointing at our eyes ? 
oh right . 
oh you just putting that up ? 
yes . 
as we went out (.) we were going to Alison's house and it was raining „ wasn't it ? 
or at least looked like it was going to rain . 
so we thought we'll go on the bus . 
and just as I was saying to you I hope we haven't missed the bus we saw it coming along . 
so Mummy put her hand out and started to run towards the bus stop and I knew there was no way I'd make the bus stop . 
but because we +/. [+ IN] 
that's right . 
because we know the bus drivers (.) we use those buss quite a lot . 
he was very kind and he slowed down „ didn't he ? 
and he slowly got to the stop and he waited for us to get on . 
but there was another man getting off „ wasn't there ? 
so that was alright . 
because he hadta stop at that stop anyway . 
when we got on Mummy said “thank you for waiting” „ didn't she ? 
he did „ didn't he ? 
he said “you're welcome” and that's when I was paying the driver you must have noticed he had a bag of crisps . 
was he actually eating the crisps ? 
or <was there the crisps> [//] was the crisp packet just there ? 
was he eating them ? 
or was the packet just there ? 
pardon ?

that's usually prawn cocktail or smoky bacon „ isn't it ? 
or when they red ? 
salt and vinegar . 
I mean ready salted . 
plain ones . 
was it red or pink ? 
oh well it must +//. [+ IN] 
I think it was smoky bacon . 
he didn't look like a prawn cocktail sort of bus driver „ did he ? 
no [<] . 
whatever prawn cocktail bus driver looks like . 
he didn't really look like a smoky bacon bus driver „ did he ? 
I think he was more a cheese and onion sort of bus driver . 
ha^ha@o . 
what are your favorite crisps ? 
nothing ? 
oh I'll remember that . 
the next time you want some crisps I'll “say oh you don't like crisps” . 
Tom ! 
<get that sausage out> [>] ! 
<no no> [/] no . 
never put sausage up your nose . 
never put anything up your nose . 
no . 
it's not funny . 
it's dangerous . 
if you put that up your nose you won't be able to breathe . 
you know when you've got a cold and you're all stuffed up like that ? 
it's not nice „ is it ? 
it isn't . 
now will you stop messing with that food please . 
I'm going to get very cross . 
why do you mess with your food ? 
if you don't want it put it to one side .

sometimes a shock works with hiccups . 
when Mummy has hiccups I take a teaspoonful of vinegar . 
and it works every time . 
but I think it's a bit too <strong for you> [>] . 
no . 
because it's too strong for you . 
it might make your tummy a bit sore . 
Mummy's a <lot bigger than you> [>] . 
there's a blackbird „ is there ?

you were playing with it earlier on . 
in fact do you not remember I was going mad because you were getting everything all over the place ? 
yes . 
I do as well .
