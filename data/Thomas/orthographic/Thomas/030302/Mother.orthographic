they weren't very expensive , Thomas . 
they were only about five pence each .

you've got one going off that way „ have you ? 
xxx that .[+ PI] 
that's right . 
there's enough room for two train tracks „ isn't there ?

<we can put> [>] [?] another bridge onto that piece there .[+ PI]

he's quite lucky having two bridges to go up „ isn't he ? 
we don't usually have a xxx [>] „ do we ?

nice to see your train . 
I'm very pleased to see it (be)cause I usually miss the train „ don't I ? 
you're always telling me I'm missing the train .

I really can't do this track , Thomas . 
I'm trying to do it <into a big circle> [>] but it's not working „ is it ? 
I think we've either got to have a small track where everything fits together and it doesn't fall off the bend . 
or we've got to have a large track and we risk losing some pieces of the end . 
it just doesn't work „ does it ? 
oh I've not missed him again „ have I ? 
mind you there seems to be plenty of trains on this train line . 
it doesn't seem to really matter if you miss the odd train because there's always another one coming along very soon after it .

I think he would .

well +... [+ IN] 
they are [//] well they are a bit old now „ aren't they ? 
they've been well used and they're a bit worn out but I think a bit of Sellotape will help . 
or they didn't cost many pennys we might as well get some new ones if we're in Didsbury . 
we've got to go to Didsbury to nursery tomorrow „ haven't we ? 
so perhaps while I'm doing some shopping in the village afterwards +... [+ IN] 
if I see some more I might get one .

Let's +//. [+ IN]

you've got your vest . 
and your shirt . 
here you are [>] . 
well we've used them a lot , Thomas . 
you think about it . 
when we go to the station we roll the flags up we pop them in your Winnie_the_pooh bag and walk all the way to the station and we unroll them and we wave them like mad when we see a train „ don't we ? 
there's only so much that little flags can stand . 
your nose is a bit runny . 
have you got a bit of a cold ? 
yes ? 
you look a bit sniffly today . 
no . 
well don't be , love . 
(be)cause little accidents happen . 
it's nice if you remember . 
you've been very [/] very good recently „ haven't you ? 
but I think the thing was you just +//. [+ IN] 
am I a little darling ? 
you're a little darling . 
I think you just got a little bit engrossed <in what you were doing> [>] . 
that's a big kiss . 
right . 
would you like to go and find your socks and sandals and I'll put those on ? 
if you'd like to sit in this chair . 
well you sit in this chair . 
go and get them then . 
no ? 
tomorrow you're going to pick them up ? 
&=laughs . 
mess pot . 
hm: . 
they are „ aren't they ? 
if you put your socks on your fingers then they're very much like gloves . 
they're like mittens „ aren't they ? 
yes . 
when we were in Spain you didn't need socks . 
we arrived you were wearing socks and your little sandals „ weren't you ? 
you shoe type sandals . 
the ones that are enclosed . 
but then when we got there we bought these „ didn't we ? 
and we didn't wear socks on holiday with sandals „ did we ? 
but I'm afraid today it feels a bit cold here „ doesn't it ? 
so <you don't> [>] mind putting socks with these sandals „ do you ? 
no . 
Rachel (h)as just come out with baby Ben . 
it's not the same Ben that (h)as lent you the garage „ is it ? 
<it's> [>] baby Ben . 
Benjamin_Thomas he's called „ isn't he ? 
baby Benjamin_Thomas . 
he was born not long before we went away . 
there we are . 
who looks a smart boy now ? 
you're a smart boy . 
let me give this smart boy a hug . 
a big clever smart boy . 
right . 
tractor . 
is that what we were playing with ? 
okay . 
are you ? 
you can do funny tricks ? 
oh yes . 
that's because you've got your fancy sandals on „ isn't it ? 
all these fancy tricks but we've got fancy sandals . 
yes . 
now be careful . 
don't start kicking things . 
here you are . 
there . 
you still look very summery , Thomas . 
(be)cause your legs are quite brown . 
you've got &-uh +//. [+ IN] 
pardon ? 
Super_Jake ? 
is that what Jake on the Tweenies is ? 
Super_Jake ? 
I've heard of Super_Ted but never Super_Jake . 
right . 
so there's the farm and it belongs in the tractor . 
let's just see if your train &-um [//] carriage [//] trailer fits onto the tractor . 
I'm sure it will (be)cause they're all meant to fit . 
did you ? 
because look . 
then you could carry +... [+ IN] 
oh yes . 
the roller's great „ isn't it ? 
the roller's really nice . 
plough the fields ! 
is that what you're doing ? 
ploughing the fields ? 
it's great . 
yeah ? 
oh , Thomas . 
doesn't it look miserable outside ? 
0it looks quite dull „ doesn't it ? 
mind you it's quite nice today (be)cause Mummy's not at work „ is she ? 
what are you doing ? 
nothing ? 
round and round like the roller ? 
oh actually it is the roller that you've got on the back . 
where's the plough ? 
this is the plough , Thomas . 
look . 
if you drag that through some soil . 
you see these they're like three knife blades . 
there we are . 
then we cut at the soil . 
that's ploughing . 
and that's rolling it and making it flat . 
I bet the horse would go in the tractor trailer . 
look at that . 
&=laughs . 
yes . 
you be careful up there (be)cause I don't want you falling . 
xxx all we need .[+ PI] 
watch that box doesn't fall , Thomas . 
come on . 
down you get , please . 
<watch it> [?] . 
either you or the box are going to fall . 
there'll be a terrible smash from one of you „ won't there ? 
Ben's fancy cockerel could sit it the trailer . 
look at that . 
&=laughs . 
<no no no> [/] no . 
well what are you looking for ? 
no . 
I tell you what you didn't needta tip everything out „ did you ? 
to look for your dumper truck . 
there you are . 
how's that ? 
okay ? 
play with you ? 
what would you like me to do ? 
okay . 
I'm just standing up (be)cause it looks like somebody is coming to the door , Thomas . 
hey . 
are you going to come and sit here ? 
we'll move those shall we ? 
well you can sit next to me if you like . 
would you like a cushion behind your back ? 
there you are . 
better put one behind myself . 
that's better „ isn't it ? 
do you like that ? 
nice and snug ? 
right . 
shall we have a look at this one first ? 
Diggers_and_Dumpers . 
we've not looked at this for a long time because +//. [+ IN] 
you know what had happened ? 
this book had got put into a bag . 
and we didn't see it . 
right . 
what's that ? 
a yellow crane . 
cranes can lift things high up into the air . [+ R] 
“I needta move some bricks” says the little boy . [+ R] 
up it goes . 
wee@o . 
that's the crane „ isn't it ? 
and what's this ? 
it's not quite like your tractor „ is it ? 
you've got a green tractor and a red trailer and this tractor's red . 
the trailer's green . 
with a yellow trailer as well . 
tractors carry food for all the animals on the farm . [+ R] 
fill the truck with hay . [+ R] 
look . 
she's putting bales of hay . 
and off we go . [+ R] 
vroom@o . 
that's funny . 
she (h)as got a cow in the back and she's filling the second <carriage with> [//] &-uh trailer with hay . 
and that's what she (h)as got there . 
but when she parks up here where (h)as the cow moved ? 
to the front ? 
and what if she looks in the back ? 
she (h)as not got hay she (h)as got +... [+ IN] 
a xxx and a chicken .[+ PI] 
that's funny „ isn't it ? 
very strange . 
I don't know . 
a dumper truck . 
yes . 
this is called the tipper truck which is the same color „ isn't it ? 
look . 
do you ? 
well theirs is blue and yellow and red . 
and yours is blue and yellow and red . 
but their tipper trailer is red and yours is +... [+ IN] 
xxx watch .[+ PI] 
yellow isn't it . 
+" tipper trucks carry heavy loads across building sites . [+ R] 
+" fill the trucks with gravel and dump it in a pile . [+ R] 
whoosh . 
you [/] you want everything don't you ? 
well we've got that round one „ haven't we ? 
the green one there . 
do you ? 
right . 
take it out of the book can we ? 
pretend it's real ? 
this machine mixes cement . 
turn the handle to mix in the sand . 
and out comes the cement . 
splat@o . 
it looks like the sand you were playing with on the beach doesn't it ? 
oh . 
I bet you do . 
you haven't actually got a dust bin liner which is quite surprising for you „ isn't it ? 
refuse lorrys collect all the rubbish . 
and she's saying “there's room for some more rubbish” . 
so I'll empty the bin . 
crash@o . 
that's a refuse lorry . 
look . 
she (h)as got a huge wheelie bin there „ hasn't she ? 
a big container . 
and can you see what she's putting in the container ? 
what paper [//] what sort of paper's this ? 
sweetie paper . 
so when she (h)as finally decided there's room for some more sweetie papers in there she's emptying the bin . 
it's like windows [>] . 
<I bet> [<] you do . 
yes . 
we'll hafta see if we can get something like that . 
look . 
she's putting the big wheelie bin onto the back of the lorry . 
you like we watched them in Didsbury on Fridays „ <didn't we> [>] ? 
and what happens ? 
we press the lever and the bins will go oop ! 
xxx tip all the rubbish into the back .[+ PI] 
and then it lowers them down and the driver drives a bit further along the road to pick up some more „ doesn't he ? 
oh [<] . 
fire engine . 
oh , Thomas . 
you've got loads of fire engines . 
do you know all the fire engines are actually <nicer than that one> [>] . 
hm: . 
the only nice thing about this fire engine is it (h)as got a nice bucket at the end of the ladder so if you are rescuing somebody +... [+ IN] 
well I don't think that's such a nice fire engine . 
not as nice as any of yours . 
but that would be useful on the back of the ladders because then if you were rescuing a pussy cat from a tree the fire man could go in that „ couldn't he ? 
he could stand in the part at the back and lift the pussy cat out of the tree . 
put them in the bucket and then it could be lowered down . 
the little boy looks like Sam doesn't he ? 
oh Sam . 
that's quite funny . 
he looks like our friend and I've just realized it's a fire man so it's fire man Sam . 
fire engines carry fire fighters ladders and hoses to a fire . 
the little boy's saying “I've got to put a fire out” . 
almost there . 
woo^oo@o [/] woo^oo@o . 
it's a fire engine . 
look . 
he must be going to put the fire out in this big block of flats . 
ah . 
what's this ? 
well is that not like the one Daddy (h)as bought you ? 
it looks like the one Daddy bought you in Spain . 
that (h)as got big wheels . 
look at it . 
do you ? 
and yours is just yellow and red and this one's blue yellow and red „ isn't it ? 
diggers can dig a berth in sand . 
scoop up the sand and dump it over here . 
roarrr@o . 
that was a nice roaring sound „ wasn't it ? 
well let's come back and sit over here and look at it . 
you wanna look at the back page . 
what can you see on the <back page> [>] ? 
another one . 
all big lorrys aren't they ? 
heavy lorrys . 
big lorrys . 
big machines . 
right . 
what was it we were looking at ? 
just them ? 
I didn't know what time it was so I hadta go and check . 
oh we've done the fire engine . 
ah we were on the digger „ weren't we ? 
diggers can dig a berth in sand .[+ R] 
scoop up the sand and dump it over here .[+ R] 
roar@o . 
that's like this digger „ isn't it ? 
oh , Thomas ! 
you've got your umbrella inside the digger . 
&=laughs . 
did you ? 
that was a silly_billy@wp thing to do „ wasn't it ? 
this umbrella is going to be broken before you get chance to use it anyway [?] . 
look at this digger . 
you see it's exactly the same . 
and you were digging sand „ weren't you ? 
<look it's> [<] just the same . 
it (h)as got a red bucket and a yellow bit that lifts up . 
ah . 
are you dumping the sand ? 
yours is bigger than the one on the page „ isn't it ? 
hm: . 
hm: . 
we can dig on the floor „ can't we ? 
okay ? 
ah . 
breakdown truck . 
breakdown trucks rescue cars and their passengers .[+ R] 
+" have you broken down ? [+ R] 
the little boy is saying . 
+" I will take you to the garage . [+ R] 
vroom@o [/] vroom@o . 
that's fancy „ isn't it ? 
that looks like a Land rover that (h)as broken down . 
a little jeep doesn't it ? 
but not a little jeep . 
a big jeep . 
ah . 
this is what we couldn't think of . 
this actually looks a bit like this as well „ doesn't it ? 
a bulldozer . 
what's the difference between the bulldozer and the digger ? 
hm: . 
there isn't an awful lot looking at the picture . 
but I'm sure there must be . 
hm: . 
well diggers must dig the ground . 
bulldozers I think must move really heavy loads don't they ? 
ah . 
funnily enough that's what it says . 
let's read it . 
a bulldozer can push very heavy loads with it's strong blade .[+ R] 
fill up the blade and drop the bricks . 
crash@o bang@o wallop@o . 
a bulldozer . 
right . 
so a [/] a bulldozer and a digger are a bit different . 
bulldozers are more for moving things „ aren't they ? 
for picking up things and moving them somewhere else . 
whereas a digger is for digging . 
right . 
we're on the last page now . 
right . 
oh listen to this . 
this is very funny . 
this book . 
it says “the publishers would like to thank the following children and their parents for appearing in this book” .[+ R] 
and these are the names of the children and see if you can recognize two names here . 
Milo . 
Bella . 
seriously <the first girl's call> [//] well the first boy is called Milo_Clare . 
Jamie_Grant . 
Bella_Heycroft . 
Lilly_Heycroft . 
Jasmine_Haynes . 
Joseph_Haynes . 
Reece_Hillier . 
no . 
Rebecca_Merrell . 
and it says a special thanks to Thomas_Purkes . 
I wonder who Thomas_Purkes was ? 
how many children does it mention ? 
Milo Jamie Bella Lilly Jasmine Joseph Rebecca and Thomas . 
that's eight . 
we'll hafta see if we can see any children in the book .
