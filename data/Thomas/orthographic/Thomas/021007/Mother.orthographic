then we don't make a lot of mess , sweetheart .

a clever dustbin wagon ! 
I think there was something on the television this morning about them . 
they call them refuse lorrys though and refuse collections „ didn't they ? 
they didn't talk of binbag days like we do . 
our binbag day's on a Monday „ isn't they ? 
do they ? 
oh dear . 
the binbags have fallen . 
all the rubbish might be falling out . 
is it ? 
Thomas , look . 
I cut some shapes out (.) of the cheese .

you went through a phase when you would only eat sandwiches and toast when it was cut in Christmas shapes . 
are you putting them down the road on Burnage lane „ are you ? 
and what day of the week is it , Thomas , that the dustbin man's coming ?

and what about Thursdays ? 
oh are you going to eat one „ are you ? 
what about Thursdays , Thomas ? 
what <happens on Thursdays> [>] ? 
pardon ? 
the dustbin bag in your mouth is lovely „ is it ? 
I don't think real dustbin bags would taste very nice . 
they are very dirty yes . 
who holds them in the lorry ? 
the dustbin men ? 
well they pick them up from the floor „ don't they ? 
and throw them in to the dustbin lorry . 
and then somebody presses a button . 
all the bags go „ don't they ? 
oh thank you . 
the dustbin bags are outside of my house „ are they ? 
well it must be Monday . 
when we go to the toddler group on Tuesdays we see all the bags there „ don't we ? 
they must have their collection (.) on Tuesdays . 
ooh . 
does it ? 
well it does usually make quite a noise „ doesn't it ? 
when they press the button for all the bags to go up it makes a terrific noise . 
like that ? 
a skip ? 
there we are . 
there's some little biscuits there with cheese on top . 
you haven't tried it . 
you like cheese . 
Thomas .

well certainly when we're walking to playgroup on Tuesday morning we see lots_of bags out . 
so the dustbin lorry's going there now „ is he ? 
Thomas , I'm worried that you're not eating anything , darling . 
you must eat something . 
you're going to be a hungry boy later on . 
would you like a banana ? 
mhm . 
well it's all very well you eating all those little sweet biscuits but they're not going to keep you going for the next three or four hours „ are they ?

I can't remember now whether it was a week ago or two weeks ago but +... [+ IN] 
you're going to eat another dustbin bag ? 
a pink dustbin bag .

oh well when all the dustbin bags have all gone , Thomas , what're you going to eat then ? 
lunch . 
oh I see . 
this is lunch . 
are you ? 
oh who's having the picnic with you ? 
Mummy and Thomas are having a picnic ? 
mm . 
that's a lovely picnic „ isn't it this ? 
a teddybear's picnic . 
it occurred to me the other day , Thomas , that (.) whenever you see trees you always say big bears live in it and I've always thought it's because on Teletubbies the have <the bear> [//] the wooden bear coming out of the trees . 
but thinking about it when we were listening to the song “the teddy bear's picnic” the other day I think it must have been on television and it showed the teddy bears in the woods „ didn't it ? 
and I'm wondering now that's why you think bears live in trees . 
you can eat another dustbin bag yes . 
because the song says if you go down to the woods today and it talks about teddy bears having their picnics in the woods „ doesn't it ? 
is that a wood ? 
that's your seat . 
well things are made out of wood . 
like the table and chairs and the cupboard . 
but a wood is like a forest . 
it's another name for a place with a lot of trees . 
and it's where big bears have picnics . 
mhm . 
do you think big bears like eating dustbin bags ? 
mhm . 
and me too he said . 
mhm . 
the [/] the <Telet(ubbys)> [<] . 
is that what the lion said ? 
oh yes . 
you're talking about <the Tele> [/] the Teletubbies being a television program and apart from the big bears coming out of the trees a big lion comes out of the trees and he says +/. [+ IN] 
does the lion say +"/. 
+" where's the big bear ?

I thought he roared . 
is that what he said ?

what is it they say ? 
where's the bear with the big brown hair ? [+ R] 
something like that . 
I can't remember . 
we've not seen it for a long time „ have we ? 
what else do they have on Teletubbies ? 
they have the animals walking two by two „ don't they ? 
what sort of animals do they have ? 
elephants with big trunks . 
what do elephants say ? 
have you been saying nooh@o ? 
that's a funny noise . 
who's doing funny dancing ? 
the elephants ? 
have you seen that ontele(vision) [//] television ? 
the elephants doing <funny dances> [>] ? 
it's a very funny dance , Thomas . 
they have ostriches and pandas and giraffes as well „ don't they ? 
your hand's an elephant . 
you're pretending your hand is an elephant's trunk . 
you're eating grass now . 
so the little biscuits have gone from being rubbish bags to being grass „ have they ? 
is it not ? 
what is it ? 
a bow ? 
a bow ? 
you mean a bowl ? 
a bowl ? 
oh I see . 
you've nearly eaten them all now „ haven't you ? 
that [?] lovely ? 
would you like a drink ? 
well I think this is lovely . 
I know you don't like it but Mummy likes it . 
Sonya and Isobel came round „ didn't they ? 
did she come and play with all your toys ? 
what were you doing ? 
you were sharing with Isobel . 
Isabel was shouting naughty girl or Sonya was shouting naughty girl ? 
who said “naughty girl” ? 
to Isobel ? 
oh why ? 
what was Isabel doing ? 
she was in big trouble ? 
no . 
the policeman didn't come , Thomas . 
don't exaggerate . 
Sonya might have shouted at Isabel and called her a naughty girl but I don't think the policeman came . 
we saw a policeman the other day „ didn't we ? 
parked outside . 
mhm . 
a big policeman parked on the road and he was looking for naughty boys „ wasn't he ? 
naughty Daddy . 
didn't find any naughty boys at our house though „ did he ? 
we've only got good boys <who live> [//] living here . 
and what's the name of the good boy who lives here ? 
Thomas Henry Lastname ! 
no . 
we don't actually know what the policeman was doing . 
he went xxx neighbor's house „ didn't he ? 
he was there quite a long time . 
it's a good job the policeman wasn't outside this morning when you picked up those stones . 
he would have put you in the back of his van „ wouldn't he ? 
what did you do with the stones ? 
you threw them in the direction of a friend's car „ didn't you ? 
they didn't hit his car luckily but oh (.) it was very naughty . 
no . 
Fred didn't see you . 
and luckily the stones didn't hit the car . 
so it was alright . 
had Fred seen you would have hadta go round and say +"/.

he's a tiny little thing „ isn't he ? 
and he's so good . 
baby Miles is cute . 
you warm enough , Thomas ? 
Mummy feels a bit cold now . 
thought [?] we might put the fire on later . 
warm us up a little bit . 
and later on we've got some letters to post . 
pardon ? 
yes . 
xxx the fire on because Mummy's feeling a little bit cold . 
but I was saying we've got to remember to go to the post letter . 
and did I say fire ? 
oh I'm terribly sorry . 
I can't remember what I said but I did mean we've got some letters to post we must do that later on . 
this afternoon . 
and where've the dustbin bags gone ? 
in your tummy ! 
they can't be big dustbin bags like the dustbin bags that we see on the pavement outside . 
because if they were there wouldn't be room for them in your tummy „ would there ? 
the dustbin lorry collects them . 
that's right . 
yes . 
it's not a windy day today . 
no . 
it was raining earlier on „ wasn't it ? 
very early this morning . 
but it's nice now .

because I was just washing the digger and he tumbled in „ didn't he ? 
but he said he was having a nice time . 
he was swimming around .

oh dear . 
Purdie (h)as gone outside „ has she ? 
do you thing she can ? 
I don't think she'll see a bee . 
there aren't many bees around at the moment . 
it's not really warm enough „ is it ? 
buzzy bees have buzzed off until it's warmer weather . 
I'm sure they'll be back „ won't they ? 
just think .

now there's cheese and biscuits there . 
there's salad . 
<there's coleslaw> [>] .

I was just saying you're not having any sweets , Thomas .

you wanna dig him . 
but you can't eat your socks , Thomas „ can you ? 
look at Purdie running across the grass . 
what's she looking for ? 
she's looking for buzzy bees and crocodiles „ is she ? 
well I hope she doesn't find any crocodiles on the grass . 
a bit scary „ wouldn't it ? 
pardon ? 
is she rushing to come back inside ? 
she (h)as not arrived at the door yet „ has she ? 
I think she (h)as rushed and gone through the gate . 
she's probably going to see what the workmen are doing at the front of Rachel's house . 
you've got one glove on . 
you've just put the digger man on your ring finger „ haven't you ? 
you're calling him your glove ? 
no . 
I don't think we've anything else that'd fit on your finger . 
oh how about the driver from the train ? 
if he's a lego man he might have a little hole underneath . 
yes he has . 
look . 
there you are . 
you've got <the digger driver> [//] the digger man on one finger and the train driver on another . 
now well I think the hole on the digger man is really very tiny „ isn't it ? 
you'll hafta use your tiny finger . 
your small finger . 
the little finger at the end . 
you've got one on your thumb and one on your index finger . 
<this is> [//] we call this Pet [/] Peter_Pointer „ don't we ? 
because this is your index finger . 
it's the one people use to point with .

she's not saying meow now though „ is she ? 
it'll do her good actually , Thomas , to have a little bit of fresh air so we won't rush letting her in . 
you'd like a break down lorry ? 
which break down lorry ? 
toy break down lorry . 
this is your breakdown set . 
your rescue set . 
is that what you mean ? 
oh yes . 
that's a road sign . 
it says +"/. [+ IN] 
+" do not enter . 
but you're quite right . 
it's from the train set . 
it's not from the breakdown set „ is it ? 
I'll put it away in the train set . 
and there's another sign there that's saying stop@q . 
both warning signs „ aren't they ? 
one's saying “do not enter” . 
one's saying stop@q . 
that's a red sign . 
that means stop . 
and I would imagine that one possibly means go@q . 
stop@q <and go@q> [>] . 
the green one does mean go@q but you haven't got a green sign „ have you ? 
and what are those two (.) orange plastic things ? 
what are they called ? 
they're called traffic cones . 
you had an icecream last night . 
and that was served in a cone . 
does this look like an icecream cone ? 
look . 
if you turn it upside down and pop some icecream in there (.) mm (.) we could eat it „ couldn't we ? 
but when they're orange and plastic and that way they're called traffic cones . 
that's right . 
the lady belongs in the car . 
she's the lady that (h)as broken down and the breakdown truck's towing her . 
but she (h)ad fallen out of that car under the table . 
is that why you're saying she was lying on the road ? 
oh the policeman's driving on my arm and telling me to get out of the way ? 
hm: . 
what a rude policeman . 
there is one . 
that's the little yellow racing car that Grandma bought you when we were in Spain . 
and the policeman (h)as caught up with him . 
you're saying big trouble . 
has he been driving too quickly ? 
and going too fast and the policeman (h)as stopped him ? 
oh has he told him he (h)as been a naughty boy ? 
I'm a naughty little girl ? 
oh was I driving the car too quickly ? 
can you manage ? 
have you hooked the lady's car onto the breakdown lorry ? 
mhm . 
no . 
the ones that are on the floor are moving round and round but because the breakdown lorry (h)as lifted her off the ground the wheels aren't touching the [/] the road anymore „ are they ? 
is it Auntie_Mabel ? 
have you seen a program with Auntie_Mabel in the breakdown truck or is this something you're imagining might happen ? 
it did actually happen „ did it ? 
you've seen it on the television ? 
oh what happened , Thomas ? 
pardon ? 
I'm sorry , sweetheart . 
I don't know what you're saying to me . 
stop ball [/] stop ball I'm saying ? 
what do you mean by “stop ball” ? 
I'm sorry , love , but I don't understand what that means . 
do you understand what it means ? 
or are you speaking gobbledygook ? 
gobbledygook . 
you're making up little phrases „ aren't you ? 
little words [>] . 
the breakdown lorry's going too fast ? 
hm: ! 
oh dear . 
it (h)as crashed into the policeman . 
oh dear dear dear . 
the signs have all fallen over ? 
did the car knock into them all or is it the wind that (h)as blown them over ? 
what's Purdie saying ? 
oh the breakdown lorry (h)as crashed into all the traffic signs and they've all fallen over . 
oh dear dear dear . 
now the policeman (h)as fallen over . 
it (h)as been a terrible accident . 
there we are . 
you've caught a fish alive ? 
well < you've hooked one of the breakdown (.) sorry> [//] you've hooked the breakdown truck's anchor into one of the traffic cones „ haven't you ? 
you're thinking about the nursery rhyme . 
one two three four five once I caught a fish alive . [+ R] 
you're thinking of the traffic cone as an orange fish being hooked on a fishing line ? 
the traffic cones are kissing ? 
you've stacked one on top of the other ? 
now [<] you've dropped them behind your chair ? 
oh no . 
don't make too much noise . 
why've you thrown the police car on the floor ? 
I bet the policeman said “what's going on” . 
because one minute his car was the there and the next it (h)as crashed . 
I bet he's not a very happy policeman , Thomas . 
what do you think ? 
look at Purdie . 
she's sitting in the strawberry patch . 
well she's right against the fence . 
that's one of the tubs that Mummy plants strawberries in . 
there we are . 
she (h)as jumped in and she (h)as jumped out now . 
no . 
well we won't have any strawberries until the summer . 
we can buy a few strawberries in the shops but they're very very expensive . 
but when we grow our own they're only available in the summer when it's hot .

the sun's shining but it's February , Thomas , and it's not really hot , love . 
it's only warm inside because we've got radiators on . 
I actually feel a bit cold .

what color are these flowers , Thomas ? 
they're not white .

<when it> [//] when the bud +//. [+ IN] 
look at this one .

how tightly closed that is . 
then it'll open a little bit more and eventually it'll be like this one . 
fish in the flowers ? 
I think it's the stalk .

it's a clear glass vase . 
you can see straight through it „ can't you ?

the petals haven't come out yet from the buds . 
right . 
these're the last ones , Thomas . 
those two stems . 
how's that ? 
these are the flowers that we put in the vase the last time . 
we like a few in the kitchen „ don't we ? 
the ones that (.) a little bit poorly . 
they've got bent heads . 
we pop them in this tiny vase . 
I keep an eye on them when I'm washing up then . 
no . 
there's nothing else now to go in . 
that's all going in the bin . 
look at that ! 
aren't you clever ! 
oh , Thomas , they do look nice „ don't they ? 
Gordon's very happy „ is he ? 
because he (h)as done some flower arranging ? 
Gordon (h)as disappeared now „ has he ?

and [?] lots_of things are disappearing „ aren't they ? 
we'll pop some more water in the vase so we've got water all the way up to the top . 
we'll put some more in . 
there we are . 
you wanna put them a bit nearer ? 
you wanna put it nearer ? 
you want me to bring it closer to you ?

yes you can . 
pardon ? 
somebody (h)as strapped you in ? 
I think it might have been Mummy . 
well we originally sat down to have something to eat „ didn't we ? 
I'm just going to get a cloth to wipe the flower vase , Thomas . 
and then now we've arranged them we've got to leave them well alone . 
we mustn't touch them . 
we've got to treat flowers gently . 
and if we keep touching them they get very upset and they won't open „ will they ? 
we can watch those over the next few days . 
watch them blossom . 
and the blooms come out . 
it's a surprise ? 
wrap it up like a present ? 
yes . 
I'm wrapping the tea towel „ aren't I ? 
round the vase .

it's all covered .

and what's the magic word ? 
do you remember from Molly's party at Christmas ?

and we've got some more flowers in vases . 
on the mantelpiece we've got pink flowers . 
<we've got a pink> [>1] xxx [>2] . 
just a minute you wanna do abra_cadabra again ? 
eh do you know what those are called ? 
what are those flowers ? 
well you must be very very careful otherwise xxx . [+ PI] 
what do we call these flowers , Thomas ?

what's it called ? 
an Auntie_Frank ? 
it's called a daffodil . 
now pop it back in the water xxx [>] . 
no . 
it'll die , Thomas , if it's kept out of the water . 
it's like a fish . 
it should be kept in water . 
right . 
pop it back in the vase please . 
is it more like a fish ? 
they're daffodils . 
and look . 
if you look out of the window [>] (.) can you see ?

now when they get to flower on top and it opens up do you know what it's going to look like ? 
it's going to be a daffodil . 
it's going to look just like these . 
so you keep watching every day . 
you look out of the window and tell me how the daffodils are doing . 
you tell me when those green shoots turn into beautiful yellow flowers like these . 
yes ? 
well I don't think we should hold them . 
we've got to treat flowers gently .

oh that reminds me I've just put the daffodils on the dress room and I can see Helen's eighteenth birthday card . 
it's her birthday . 
we better get the card written „ hadn't we ? 
right . 
let's do abra_cadabra once more with the big flowers and then we've got to leave them alone because they want a little rest . 
and I think Mummy would be better using a tea towel for drying up the breakfast pots „ don't you ? 
flys coming out ? 
where are the flys coming out ? 
they better nor be . 
they're fresh flowers . 
where can you see flys ?
