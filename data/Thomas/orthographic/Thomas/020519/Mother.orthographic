hope you're not going to start being a naughty boy . 
why don't you post them through the box ? 
post the shapes through the shape sorter .

they can go through the tunnel as well „ can't they ?

that carriage keeps tipping up „ doesn't it ? 
the green one ?

the green carriage +//. [+ IN]

what do you think they put in that train ? 
do you think they transport coal along the railway ? 
something like coal ? 
coal . 
or gravel . 
they could be taking gravel along the railway line . 
in a big truck for Bob_The_Builder „ couldn't they ? 
Bob_The_Builder . 
yes . 
he might wanna do some work . 
and then one of his lorrys could meet the train at the station . 
and tip the gravel from the train into the lorry . 
and take it back to Bob_The_Builder . 
and he could use it to lay a new path . 
or driveway for somebody „ couldn't he ?

it's going backwards into the dining room instead of on the floor into the kitchen . 
we were on a train the other day . 
and we traveled backwards on the way home „ didn't we ? 
we went forwards on the way there . 
but we sat with seats facing the front on the way home . 
and we traveled backwards . 
you've been on the train with Grandma and Granddad ?

there's no rush „ is there ? 
here it is . 
oh you clever boy doing that . 
it's very good „ isn't it ? 
why don't you put them into that box once you've caught them ? 
we could go home and we could have them with chips and peas „ couldn't we ?

when it comes to lunchtime you've got a nice clean seat to sit in . 
that's good „ isn't it ? 
what's Thomas doing ? 
be careful . 
you've got to be careful it might break .

especially in the eye . 
or the face . 
<because if> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
if you banged yourself or anybody else it would hurt very much „ wouldn't it ?

I think it's a little bit of water that's still inside the dispenser bit . 
that's rattling when you're shaking it . 
well that's an empty bottle but I've saved it . 
because when we go on holiday we could take a little bit from the new bottle . 
put it into the old bottle and we can take it with us rather than carrying <a big heavy> [/] a big heavy bottle . 
so that's what we're doing with it .
