Auntie_Mabel's just sitting inside having a cup of coffee wondering what's going to happen today . 
I wonder if the Postman will come . 
I wonder if I'll see Postman_Pat today .

sounds as if there might be somebody there . 
I'll just go to the door anyway .

would you like to pass the bees ? 
no thanks ? 
we could do with a little box to keep all these tea things in „ couldn't we ? 
I threw away the box that they came in which was a bit silly . 
because there was nothing really wrong with it . 
I just thought they would stack easier . 
well we (h)ad have more space for them if they were loose . 
but they're a bit of a nuisance now „ aren't they ? 
so that was a silly thing that Mummy did . 
one of many silly things that Mummy does these days .

it's nice to see .

oh you've given a letter to Purdie „ have you ?
