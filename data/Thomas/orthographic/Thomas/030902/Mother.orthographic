I can hear jingle bells . 
<is that> [/] is that coming from your socks ? 
are your socks playing jingle bells ? 
are they ? 
go on , Purdie . 
Purdie wants to go out . 
what happens if you press the button on your socks , Thomas ? 
what happens if you press the button on your socks ? 
oh . 
are you going to sing ? 
are you going to help me wrap these two presents ? 
come on , Thomas . 
please . 
I didn't kick it , Thomas . 
I perhaps bumped into it but I didn't kick it . 
right . 
which paper are we going to use ? 
this nice one with snowmen on . 
with holly bushes on ? 
it's a bit late to be wrapping presents really but we've got Auntie Sam's coming tonight . 
she's coming for a meal and bringing baby Zoe . 
absolutely why we're giving her a Christmas present because we didn't see them before Christmas and then over Christmas you and Daddy were too poorly to have visitors so they're coming tonight so do you wanna come and have a look at these ? 
look at these little shoes . 
do you think she'll like these little [/] little well they're slippers rather than shoes „ aren't they ? 
look at those . 
well yes . 
they are shoes really „ aren't they ? 
look . 
they're nice for babies . 
look . 
they're red and they've got little tartan cuffs . 
can you see those ? 
round the ankle and what are those one the front ? 
hedgehogs and the two hedgehogs have got little tartan bows look to match the cuff on the shoes . 
you wanna wrap them in holly berries „ do you ? 
don't make a lot of noise with that please , Thomas . 
are you going to help me with the sticky tape and cutting ? 
so we've got her these little slippers and we've also got her a little sweater „ haven't we ? 
right . 
we needta cut the paper . 
do you think that's enough paper ? 
you do ? 
we'll cut it along there . 
we'll use the snowman one for the slippers and then we'll use the holly berry one for the sweater . 
right . 
there we are . 
shall we put the scissors there ? 
near the snowmen . 
I think that should be enough „ don't you ? 
well let's cut it up there and then we don't cut the snowman's hat off „ do we ? 
do you know what these words say ? 
Merry Christmas . 
Merry Christmas . 
Merry Christmas . 
and that one says “snowman snowman snowman snowman” . 
well that's just snowflakes „ isn't it ? 
falling through the sky onto the snowmen . 
do you remember that story we read last night ? 
about no snowman . 
the no snowman . 
what was the no snowman ? 
he wasn't a snowy one „ was he ? 
no because the little girl wanted to make a snowman and grandma [/] grandma looked out of the window and said “ooh when I was little it useta be snowy at Christmas and we made snowmen” . 
and the little girl said “well I wanna make a snowman” . 
and grandma said “well you can't (be)cause there isn't any snow” . 
so they made a no snowman out of two sacks „ didn't they ? 
and some buttons and they dressed him as if he was a real snowman and then when the snow fell they covered the no snowman and he looked like a real snowman anyway „ didn't he ? 
these look a little bit strange . 
they look as if they're both the same foot . 
oh . 
I don't understand . 
right . 
do you think Zoe will like those ? 
is pussy back at the door ? 
right , Thomas . 
what are we doing with this tape ? 
we're sticking ? 
well find the end . 
it's always a problem if you lose the end . 
there we are . 
I tell you what . 
let's put it back on the Sellotape roll . 
that's it . 
are you going to help ? 
we've got it upside down , darling . 
we need the roll the other way . 
I needta put the roll in the other way . 
like that . 
now you mustn't get it on that paper (be)cause that's the part of the paper we're not using „ isn't it ? 
no . 
just a minute . 
right . 
we needta use the scissors to snip it . 
I will . 
not just yet . 
no . 
don't play with that Thomas , please . 
leave it because it's a very sharp end . 
no . 
no . 
it's a very sharp end there . 
it (h)as got to be sharp enough to put the sticky tape . 
if you run your finger along it (.) you'll get cut and then what will happen ? 
well what do you think would happen if you cut your finger ? 
you can have that bit . 
yes . 
look . 
would you like +/. [+ N] 
+, to sit in your chair . 
and I'll cut you a little piece of this wrapping paper and I'll get your special scissors with the blunt end and they you can have some sticky tape . 
sorry . 
I'll cut you a piece of paper from this sheet with my sharp scissors . 
there you are . 
let me just got to the cupboard and get you some blunt scissors . 
yes . 
that's right . 
well I'm having a job to find any scissors at the moment , Thomas . 
here we are . 
we've [<] got red ones blue ones and yellow ones . 
when I say they're blunt they still cut but they're not as sharp as Mummy's „ are they . 
they're special childrens scissors . 
oh , they're still sharp . 
you've still got to be careful with them . 
alright . 
okay . 
the red ones just cut a straight line and the blue and the yellow ones give a jagged edge „ don't they ? 
hello , puss . 
yes . 
and then when we've wrapped these presents and when you've had a bit of play with your paper we're going to start taking some decorations down . 
because today is what's called well we say today it's what's called twelfth night , Thomas . 
do you remember the song the twelve days of Christmas ? 
well today is what's called the twelfth day of Christmas and by tonight we've got to have taken down all the Christmas cards all the Christmas lights the Christmas tree all the Christmas decorations because if we don't +/. [+ N] 
+, it's sposta be bad luck and we don't want bad luck „ do we in this house ? 
do you remember when you were in your nativity play at nursery and you were one of the shepherds „ weren't you ? 
and do you remember those three little boys that were dressed as kings or wise men that had crowns on and they each brought good gifts to baby Jesus „ do you remember that ? 
he did „ didn't he ? 
yes . 
want me to tell you that story ? 
that's fine . 
you can cut off whatever you like , darling . 
that's your piece of paper to do whatever you like . 
well <we had three wise> [//] Mrs Platfords the nursery that you're going to in Didsbury this afternoon . 
that's fine . 
you know what else you could do ? 
you could actually cut round one of the snowmen . 
but you could „ couldn't you if you wanted to like this ? 
and then you've got a special snowman shape like this . 
round his hat . 
the Sellotape ? 
yes . 
the sticky tape . 
that's right . 
so Mrs Platford she did a nativity play „ didn't you ? 
and there were a lot of children in it and you were all different ages . 
some were two some were three like you . 
some were four and some were five and there were three little boys dressed as the three wise men „ weren't there ? 
and the first little boy came down the aisle and he stood in front of baby Jesus in the crib and Mrs Platford said “what are you sposta do with your present” ? 
(be)cause he was bringing gold „ wasn't he ? 
he had a beautiful box covered in shiny paper and he didn't remember what he was sposta do with the present and Mrs Platford said “give it to the baby” . 
and what did he do ? 
threw it in the crib at the baby Jesus „ didn't he ? 
the second little boy came with a gift of frankincense and he said to the baby he shouted “I bring you” +/. [+ N] 
I bring you frankincense . 
he really shouted it „ didn't he ? 
and if that had been a real baby in the crib he would've woken it up . 
mind you the baby would be awake already (be)cause the gold would've been thrown at him . 
and then the third little boy came along . 
that was Robert „ wasn't it ? 
and Robert didn't wanna give the myrrh away „ did he ? 
he cried . 
he wanted to just keep hold of the box and open it himself „ didn't he ? 
so what happened ? 
you know we've had Christmas now . 
we've had the story of baby Jesus . 
you don't wanna talk anymore ? 
you wanna just cut up paper . 
well let me just tell you this (be)cause you asked me to tell you the story . 
tonight is twelfth night . 
we've got to take the decorations down and tomorrow is what's called epiphany . 
epiphany it's epiphany . 
it's sposta be the time when the three wise men or the kings followed the star that they saw in the sky +/. [+ N] 
yes . 
like your star . 
well it's not now (be)cause it's day time „ isn't it ? 
but like the stars we see at night . 
do you remember the wise men looked up and they saw a star in the east and they followed it „ didn't they ? 
and it was sposta shine directly over the stable where Jesus was born . 
yes . 
what [/] what was that song we sang ? 
<we three kings from orient are> [=! sings] . 
do you remember that ? 
is it my song ? 
it's a church song that „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
a Christmas carol . 
look I cut round the snowman . 
do you like that ? 
don't you ? 
you do really „ don't you ? 
do you ? 
and then Thomas , the other thing about tonight . 
do you remember that story the twelve days of Christmas . 
<on the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me> [=! sings] . 
what did they send ? 
four calling birds ? 
that was about the fourth day „ wasn't it ? 
have you still got that book ? 
the twelve days of Christmas book . 
this is quite funny actually (be)cause this book belonged to somebody else before you and inside somebody (h)as written “happy birthday Tom twelfth of December nineteen eighty eight” . 
so that's quite funny that the little boy who had this book before you was called Tom . 
some doughnuts ? 
oh well . 
look the twelve days of Christmas . 
the first day it was a partridge in a pear tree . 
the second day +/. [+ N] 
two turtle doves . 
the third three +/. [+ N] 
three hens laying . 
that's right . 
three french hens . 
fourth day . 
that's the one you said before . 
<four calling birds> [=! sings] . 
this is the one that you remember from the song . 
and the fifth day of Christmas my true love sent to me . 
five [=! sings] . 
that's right . 
<five gold rings> [=! sings] . 
look the lady has got three on one hand and two on another . 
the sixth day . 
no . 
it was six geese a laying „ wasn't it ? 
how many ? 
one two three four five six .[+ R] 
look at all those eggs . 
the seventh day it was +/. [+ N] 
swans . 
eighth day . 
no . 
don't be silly , Thomas . 
stop it . 
that's naughty . 
eight maids a milking . 
look . 
milking the cows . 
are they playing ? 
yes . 
they look like they might be having a bit of a chat „ don't they ? 
the ninth day . 
nine ladys dancing . 
look at that with their fancy dress and all their hair blowing . 
the tenth day it was ten lords a leaping . 
now don't . 
put it there please . 
the eleventh day eleven pipers piping and then the twelfth day which is today . 
do you know what they sent ? 
on the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me twelve drummers drumming . 
can you imagine twelve people in this house going bang bang bang bang bang bang ? 
the thing is though , Thomas . 
not long ago . 
a few hundred years ago . 
she put in her what room ? 
her willing room ? 
sorry . 
ah . 
willing room is instead of living room . 
is that what Purdie would be saying ? 
what's going on in my living room ? 
but a few hundred years ago , Thomas people useta celebrate tonight . 
twelfth night . 
some people still do . 
remember . 
you can do . 
Mummy went to a twelfth night party once and so it might well have had twelve people in the house with drums . 
hm: . 
on the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me . 
yes . 
twelve drummers drumming . 
eleven pipers piping . 
ten lords a leaping . 
nine ladys dancing . 
eight maids a milking . 
seven swans a swimming . 
six geese a laying . 
five +/. [+ N] 
rings . 
four calling birds . 
three french hens . 
two turtle doves and a +/. [+ N] 
very good . 
well . 
why don't you stick some Sellotape onto those pieces of paper ? 
I'm going to need those scissors back in a minute though Thomas . 
to wrap up the other present we've bought Zoe . 
<we've got her> [//] would you like that piece of Sellotape , sweetheart ? 
if you leave it on your plastic scissors then it won't stick anything else „ will it ? 
look . 
this is the other thing we bought Zoe . 
it's like your fleece „ isn't it ? 
ooh . 
in fact you're wearing your checked fleece today . 
look . 
but Zoe's fleece is in little girls color „ isn't it ? 
I say little girls colors . 
boys could wear it as well . 
it's yellow and orange and red and green but <it looks> [/] it looks a little more like a girl's fleece than the one you're wearing „ doesn't it ? 
I think it'll fit her (be)cause she's only a very small little girl and you know what Zoe likes doing with her daddy ? 
when her daddy has a day off he puts her in a baby sling and he goes walking with her . 
he walks ever such a long way so that would be nice to keep her warm „ wouldn't it ? 
do you think she'd like that ? 
you don't think so ? 
why are we talking about tummy bugs ? 
oh no . 
I thought we were talking about Zoe's fleece . 
I don't know why you started talking about tummy bugs . 
please can I have those scissors now . 
I need +/. [+ N] 
well I will when I've finished with them . 
do you needta just use this paper ? 
is it rubbish ? 
don't play with that , please . 
Purdie (h)as come to see what we're doing . 
look . 
do you think Purdie would like some of those other presents , Thomas if she didn't like the twelve drummers drumming ? 
do you think she would've liked the hens and the geese (.) and the partridge ? 
yes . 
no . 
Purdie doesn't like pears but I know you do . 
when you were poorly over Christmas all you wanted to do was eat pears „ wasn't it ? 
was that (be)cause they were nice and juicy ? 
we've got two apple trees in the garden . 
these are apple trees here . 
this one hasn't got any leafs on at the moment and these +/. [+ N] 
do you think so ? 
when we're in bed ? 
it would be nice if it would . 
like pears . 
it would save me a lot of money if we had a pear tree in the garden . 
mind you there wouldn't be pears on it now „ would there ? 
(be)cause they don't &-um +/. [+ N] 
I don't think we'd have pears +/. [+ N] 
well I just needta finish wrapping this present , darling for Zoe . 
and when Zoe comes she's going to stay for tea . 
she's only a few months old . 
you mustn't throw anything . 
no you've got to be a very good boy <(be)cause she's only a tiny> [>] baby . 
she was born in July so she's only about six seven months old „ isn't she ? 
in a minute . 
would you like to help stick some Sellotape onto this present ? 
be careful . 
Mummy'll show you where . 
there we are . 
let's pop it there . 
little piece there . 
that's it . 
xxx please , Tom . [+ I] 
right . 
now cut another piece and you can help again . 
she's a little bit young to even be excited about her present but her Mummy and Daddy might like it . 
right . 
now . 
<put that xxx > [>] . [+ PI] 
no . 
don't . 
cut it there , love . 
would you like to stick this piece down ? 
Thomas ? 
would you like to stick this piece in here ? 
come and help me . 
<one more piece> [<] . 
we've lost the end of that now „ haven't we ? 
a bit low ? 
what do you mean it's a bit low ? 
a bit bigger . 
in a second . 
no . 
I won't put it in the rubbish . 
okay . 
you like to think you've got two presents . 
I think that's rather nice „ don't you ? 
now . 
right . 
I'm going to put this away now so we don't waste anymore tape . 
I think it's coming to the end of the roll because can you see that red from there ? 
that must mean it's getting near the end . 
so when Sam arrives with Zoe +/. [+ N] 
well we'll leave the presents in there +/. [+ N] 
no . 
and would you like to give them to her . 
and give her a kiss and say “happy Christmas this is from us” . 
and we've still got some more presents to wrap (be)cause we've got two books for Nana and Grandad Bilby . 
we've got a little dress to wrap for Jessica (be)cause we haven't seen anybody in York yet „ have we ? 
well we didn't see a fire station in York . 
no . 
(be)cause we've not been „ have we ? 
is that what you mean ? 
and later on we're going to go out , Thomas because +/. [+ N] 
+, we needta get some shopping in Didsbury but also last night there was a big fire near here and Daddy says the building (h)as collapsed . 
do you wanna go and see that ? 
you went to bed last night and you went to sleep +/. [+ N] 
there was a big bang (be)cause you went to sleep and I heard nee_naw^nee_naw^nee_naw@o and I said “oh Thomas can you hear those sirens” ? 
and you must have just gone to sleep because you didn't answer me and Daddy was having a bath and I went into the bathroom and said “Daddy , there's an awful lot of sirens” and then we heard some more and I went into Mummy's bedroom and as I was drawing the curtains I saw huge flames shooting above Sue's house and just as I was telling Daddy there was a very big bang it sounded like someone was dropping a big pile of wood and we didn't know what it was and we thought perhaps it was a car on fire or something but then this morning Daddy went out in the car and you know that big building near Tesco ? 
I don't mean Tesco but it was on the other side of the road where for a long time we've seen +/. [+ N] 
like that big strip of paper . 
a big house . 
yes . 
it looked like a big hotel they were building and they've only just got the windows in „ do you remember ? 
and we've been watching cranes and diggers and mixers . 
well Daddy said it (h)as all burnt to the ground . 
it (h)as collapsed . 
so when we go to Didsbury later shall we go past and have a look ? 
but we can't get very close . 
it might be dangerous . 
well I think we would get hurt if we went very close . 
so do you think Fireman_Sam was very busy last night ? 
I think he would've been if there was a fire to put out „ don't you ? 
I think Purdie would like to help decorate the tree . 
not decorate it . 
undecorate it . 
she useta like undecorating the tree you know . 
&=laughs . 
timber . 
yes that's for a tree , Thomas . 
when trees come down people shout timber@q . 
have you finished with your scissors now ? 
would you like to pop them away in that box please ? 
and then we'll tidy away . 
they're rubbers . 
they rub pencil marks out . 
look there's a pilchard@d there from Bob_the_builder . 
it's a pencil sharpener „ isn't it ? 
just do it onto this paper , darling then it won't make a mess . 
just do it straight onto there . 
no . 
you must do it over there . 
no . 
not in there , love . 
it goes in there . 
that hole in there . 
move your chair a bit closer and just do it over that paper . 
that's it . 
clever boy . 
that makes your pencil nice and sharp „ doesn't it ? 
shall we put this little snowman in Mummy cut out ? 
well we'll pop it in the pencil box and then the next time we go to get the pencils scissors and rubbers we'll see that snowman and think “ah , remember that day we were doing this” ? 
look you turn it all the way round . 
hold the sharpener still in your hand . 
that's it . 
hold it still in that hand and then with this one you turn the pencil all the way round . 
it's the pencil that goes all the way round not the sharpener . 
that's it . 
round round round . 
and can you see all these shavings coming off ? 
let's have a look at the pencil . 
no , not quite . 
we've got to keep going „ haven't we ? 
round and round and round and round . 
round we go . 
yes . 
yes . 
just on the piece of paper though , Thomas . 
(be)cause it makes an awful mess . 
just over there . 
that's it . 
there's a funny clicking sound . 
it sounds as if the pencil's being sharpened then breaks again . 
I think it's fine . 
you can keep going . 
we'll soon have a nice point on that pencil „ won't we ? 
that's a good boy you know how to do it . 
it was a funny click . 
let's have a look in there . 
no . 
pencil's still getting sharp . 
keep on going . 
must do it over there though . 
there is . 
a ghost ? 
I don't think so . 
no . 
we'll be able to write a name on something in a minute with this . 
round and round . 
let's just get rid of these shavings . 
you can do it once more but don't do it anymore because other wise the pencil point will be so sharp it will just break . 
that's it . 
watch your fingers , Thomas . 
that's it . 
would you like to draw on that piece of paper now you've got your pencil sharp ? 
you don't wanna after all that ? 
are you ? 
ooh . 
do you know actually funnily you should say that Thomas because it is Abigail's birthday on well no . 
it's her party today . 
when was the fourth ? 
it's the sixth today „ is it ? 
I don't know what day it is today . 
Saturday . 
it must've been on Thursday Abigail's birthday and we've funnily enough in that bag with the dress we've got for Jessica and the things we've just wrapped for Zoe we've got a birthday present for Abigail . 
it's a little dress and it's her party today but we haven't been able to go (be)cause you're not still really very well and Daddy's not really well enough to go and it's a long way away that party „ isn't it ? 
we haven't gone . 
no . 
it's Zoe that's coming this afternoon . 
baby Zoe . 
Abigail's a little bit older than Zoe . 
timber . 
well we don't pull it . 
just a minute , Thomas . 
let me just move these . 
good . 
well Purdie normally gets quite excited when the tree comes down . 
she does like to help . 
just moving these now . 
yes . 
oh yes . 
when Ben came to see you did you put that Christmas cracker on the tree ? 
well do you want me to (.) keep the Christmas cracker for another year or shall we pull it and see what's inside ? 
which [//] where did you make this , Thomas ? 
Miss Ashworth's ? 
I was just going to say let's have a little look . 
isn't this beautiful ? 
is this Santa's hat here with the cotton wool (.) and his face and beard ? 
yes . 
yes . 
one two three . [+ R] 
ooh . 
didn't snap . 
is it sposta snap ? 
pop . 
ah . 
this looks like it (h)as been made with a toilet roll some crepe paper and cotton wool . 
what's inside ? 
is it ? 
oh did you do this at school „ did you ? 
okay . 
well you needn't go behind the sofa , darling . 
I'm not going to pinch it . 
a secret ? 
okay . 
well I think that's lovely that cracker . 
do you remember making that at school ? 
do you remember putting something inside it ? 
there's a lot of rustling of paper , Thomas . 
is it exciting ? 
yes ? 
yeah . 
what is it ? 
what is it ? 
0 [=! gasps] . 
look at those . 
shall I get a little bowl ? 
shall I get the sweetie bowl ? 
well get the sweetie bowl and put them in and then we can see what there is . 
okay . 
I can't find the little sweetie bowl but this is the Tweenies yoghurt pot that Mummy washed out yesterday . 
do you wanna put them in that ? 
they're not dozy . 
Thomas , did Miss Ashworth or Miss Lansdale put them in the bag or did you children put them bags ? 
you didn't ? 
<so did you know what> [//] look at these . 
these are sposta be toothbrushes . 
little sweets . 
look . 
a yellow toothbrush with bristles . 
they're sweets though „ aren't they ? 
and a peach one with bristles . 
another peach one with bristles . 
there's a little snake . 
thank you . 
which one are you going to have ? 
you haven't chosen yet ? 
mhm , that was nice . 
oh lovely because then the cracker that you made +/. [+ N] 
I think it's sposta be two different sweets . 
I think it's sposta be a jelly worm and a little jelly round sweet but because the round sweet (h)as got on the back of the worm it does look like a snail „ doesn't it ? 
don't eat them all now . 
I've had one and you're having two and we (h)ad better leave them till later to show Daddy . 
mhm . 
that's keeping us quiet „ isn't it ? 
do you know what I heard on the news yesterday , Thomas ? 
do you remember going to that disco at Molly's for Molly's birthday ? 
in Glossop ? 
well that was a very noisy night „ wasn't it ? 
do you remember all the loud music ? 
well there are places called nightclubs that big boys and girls go to (.) and they go to discos and when they go home in the early hours of the morning +/. [+ N] 
+, sometimes people are quite noisy and do you know what they've done at one of the nightclubs ? 
they've given all the big boys and girls that go to the discos lollipops on the way out (.) and on the way home when they're walking home (.) they're so busy sucking the lollipops that they keep quiet . 
they don't make a lot of noise . 
now that's funny „ isn't it ? 
that reminded me of you (be)cause when you put a lollipop in your mouth you're quiet . 
one more . 
one more and then we'll put them away . 
no , Thomas . 
you can't . 
just have one more and save some for later . 
save some for later . 
<no no> [/] no . 
now you're not [//] no . 
you're not enjoying them when you do that . 
you're just putting them in your mouth one after the other . 
choose another one and then the pot's going away . 
we'll show Daddy what was in the cracker . 
one more . 
right . 
the others are going away Thomas now . 
what nothing . 
&=laughs [>] . 
no . 
no . 
you're not showing Daddy now . 
Daddy's asleep in bed . 
well why don't we put them back in the bag and then back in the cracker and then we can pull the cracker again later (.) and then Daddy will think it's the first time we've pulled the cracker and he won't realize we've already opened it „ will he ? 
come on . 
let's [/] let's hide them again . 
let's put them back in there . 
back in the cracker .
