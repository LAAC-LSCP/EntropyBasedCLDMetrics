you've decided to put all your cereal on a place mat „ have you ? 
that's a nice place mat . 
oh is that what they are ? 
dustbin bags ? 
are you ? 
you've put a lot of honey nut loops . 
I see . 
you're pretending to be a dustbin man „ are you ? 
coming to collect [>] +... [+ IN] 
it is a funny lorry ? 
it looks more like a spoon to me . 
mhm . 
looks quite nice rubbish to me (.) does that . 
you can't eat them ? 
I think you can do . 
you can't eat real rubbish bags (.) but you can eat these . 
you tell me that you don't like honey , Thomas . 
but these taste of honey . 
oh I see . 
those are for you to collect „ are they ? 
are they rubbish bags outside of my house ? 
well yes (.) he (h)as got a lot to collect . 
mhm . 
gosh . 
that's a lot of bags . 
are they bags or are they wheelie bins ? 
wheelie bins . 
Grandma and Granddad have got a wheelie bin now „ haven't they ? 
when Mummy and Daddy lived in Didsbury (.) we had a wheelie bin . 
and then when we moved here we hadta go back to using black dustbin bags . 
Grandma and Granddad_Bealby have a wheelie bin (.) in York . 
and Grandma and Granddad Lastname have just got a wheelie bin . 
and we've watched the dustbin lorry „ haven't we ? 
in Didsbury . 
what [<] [/] what happens ? 
the wheelie bin goes on the back and then the machine lifts it up and empties the bin . 
I think it does two at a time „ doesn't it ? 
two bins side by side . 
oh if it's red &-uh (.) dustbin lorry that must be the one we see in Didsbury on a Friday morning . 
we see that when we're going to <dustbin &-uh> [//] bang^a^drum^time@c „ don't we ? 
we see the dustbin lorry on School_Lane „ don't we ? 
emptying all the bin bags . 
and then usually when we're walking home (.) we see it along Kingsway . 
yes . 
I think the microphone just fell down . 
there's an aeroplane going past . 
I wouldn't have thought the vibration would have made it do that but +... 
gosh . 
that was quite xxx „ wasn't it ? 
I wonder what made it suddenly fall down . 
how's that ? 
that's right . 
that's what it did . 
the flying microphone . 
it (h)as never done that before „ has it ? 
yes . 
how very funny . 
it's a good job it didn't fall on your head . 
you know that cupboard that Sister_Eileen took away ? 
that was quite useful for putting the microphone on top „ wasn't it ? 
the cupboard ? 
I don't think the cupboard will come back , Thomas . 
pardon ? 
you're not saying anything ? 
where've you got this silly laugh from , Thomas ? 
the laugh that you just did then . 
ha^ha^ha@o . 
oh , Thomas . 
now stop it . 
mhm . 
you mean the microphone ? 
well don't drop your drink . 
you remember what happened last night (.) with your yoghurt . 
now what happened last night ? 
you were messing about . 
I kept telling you not to mess about at the table . 
and you did . 
and what happened to the yoghurt ? 
I think you do . 
yes . 
you're looking in the right place . 
it went all up the wall „ didn't it ? 
mhm . 
it did . 
absolutely everywhere . 
on the wall (.) on the carpet (.) and on the curtain . 
Mummy wasn't happy „ was she ? 
I don't think I was . 
because it wasn't an accident . 
you (h)ad been messing about and I kept telling you not too . 
yes ? 
pardon ? 
who's going in the castle ? 
tell me again . 
yes . 
well the dustbin man collected all the rubbish . 
so I haven't got any rubbish outside of my house . 
that's nice . 
oh [<] and I was just going to say “nice and clean for the weekend” . 
<I see> [<] . 
has he ? 
it is a loud aeroplane . 
I was just thinking that , Thomas . 
it's always like this though on a Sunday when it gets to this time of year . 
lots_of people flying to holidays . 
flying away on holiday I should say . 
a lot of people are going away (.) a lot of people are coming back . 
it's worst in August . 
Sundays in August are absolutely terrible . 
we have aeroplanes all day „ don't we ? 
you enjoying your breakfast ? 
are you enjoying breakfast , Thomas ? 
you not talking to me ? 
there's a dustbin bag on the floor . 
look . 
one honey nut loop on the floor . 
shall I pick it up ? 
oh your mouth's the dustbin wagon „ is it ? 
has it ? 
is it on it's way to the tip ? 
isn't it ? 
oh he has „ hasn't he ? 
a lot of people must have been putting their rubbish out . 
what would you like on your toast this morning , Thomas ? 
Thomas_Henry ? 
is there anybody there ? 
one of the dustbin men (h)as just closed his eyes ? 
but what would the dustbin man like to eat for his breakfast ? 
well he can still answer me even if he can't see . 
what do you think he would like on his toast ? 
Thomas ! 
red jam +... [+ IN] 
+, please ? 
I don't think we've got any red jam , Thomas . 
we've got some marmalade . 
would you like marmalade ? 
yes please ? 
we've not had marmalade for quite a long time „ have we ? 
there we are . 
<you do quite> [>] +... [+ IN] 
Grandma and Granddad have got some yellow marmalade „ have they ? 
pardon ? 
the dustbin man walking down the street said “all clear” ? 
oh [<] you mean all the dustbin bags are clear ? 
two men are walking together ? 
have they had enough honey nut [/] honey nut loops ? 
you think so . 
yes . 
you're going to have a nice piece of toast with marmalade now . 
<did he> [>] ? 
<then on he got and off he went> [=! singing] . 
it sounded like you were starting to sing the song that Julian taught us . 
I think that's what you were singing „ weren't you ? 
there you are . 
toast [>] . 
tubby toast ? 
yes . 
it's on a Teletubby plate . 
look . 
look at that . 
mhm . 
is that food nice ? 
would you like a banana or an apple , Thomas ? 
an apple ? 
please ? 
excuse me . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
very tired this morning , Thomas . 
do you feel tired ? 
I was just looking for some kitchen roll . 
<in here> [?] . 
is the toast nice , Thomas ? 
<are you> [<] just licking the [/] the marmalade ? 
right . 
we'll cut the apple in half . 
I've just washed it . 
cut it in half . 
and then half again and that's a quarter . 
half that again and that's another quarter . 
so we have one (.) two (.) three (.) four quarters . 
I'll just take the pips out now . 
there you are . 
shall I pop it on your plate there ? 
it looks a nice apple „ doesn't it ? 
I like the color of the skin . 
is it more like a pear ? 
you mean the shape of it ? 
or the color inside ? 
pardon ? 
pardon ? 
you love it ? 
do you mean the marmalade or the pear ? 
<or the> [<] +... [+ IN] 
the pear ? 
you love pear ? 
but this is an apple „ isn't it ? 
you saying it looks more like a pear ? 
is it ? 
have some toast and marmalade . 
shall I put more in the toaster machine ? 
must be careful not to forget we've put it in because the toaster doesn't always pop up „ does it ? 
oh ! 
when I put some margarine on your toast it was warm . 
mine (h)as gone cold . 
can you hear the way it's scraping ? 
that scraping noise . 
sounds very crunchy and crispy „ doesn't it ? 
are you enjoying that , love ? 
is that nice ? 
yours sounds crunchy now you're eating it „ doesn't it ? 
this marmalade's made from oranges . 
do you remember watching the Auntie_Mabel and Pippin program ? 
where they went to a marmalade factory and saw marmalade being made ? 
what happened in that program ? 
can you not remember ? 
well I think it started off with Pippin not feeling very well . 
he was lying in his basket . 
he had a tummy ache . 
because I think Auntie_Mabel and Pippin had been out the day before „ hadn't they ? 
and Pippin had found some food . 
something like a sausage or a beefburger that somebody had thrown down and he ate it . 
and it must not have been very fresh . 
and it made him poorly . 
did he ? 
I can't remember that part . 
and Auntie_Mabel (.) was going to a marmalade factory . 
and she saw +//. [+ IN] 
well I think Auntie_Mabel got an aeroplane „ didn't she ? 
to Spain ? 
and watched the oranges being picked . 
and then they were flown back to the factory . 
pardon [>] ? 
did they go on a train first ? 
mhm . 
and Auntie_Mabel went to the factory where they were washed and peeled and boiled with sugar . 
and put into jars and they had labels on them . 
and then they went off in an old van . 
when I say old van I don't mean a tatty@d van (.) but it was an old fashioned van „ wasn't it ? 
and Auntie_Mabel bought a little pot or marmalade for Pippin . 
and then she remembered a story about Queen_Mary who wasn't very well . 
she felt quite sea sick when she was on a ship . 
and one of the maids said she (h)ad heard that marmalade was very good for settling the stomach . 
so Queen_Mary had a spoonful of marmalade to see if she felt better . 
so Auntie_Mabel wondered if the marmalade she brought back from the marmalade factory would help Pippin's tummy . 
it's a good job that Pippin wasn't feeling very well because Pippin couldn't have gone on the aeroplane to Spain „ could he ? 
oh I keep saying he . 
I think Pippin's a girl . 
oh Pip +//. [+ IN] 
oh that train sounded clear „ didn't it ? 
poop poop . 
and then <on &-uh> [//] Auntie_Mabel went to the marmalade factory . 
well dogs wouldn't be allowed in the marmalade factory „ would they ? 
not where they're making food . 
do you ? 
you wish you (h)ad gone to Burnage_Station to watch that train ? 
hm: [=! laugh] . 
the trains have a lot to say this morning „ don't they ? 
poop poop . 
can you see the little girl crossing the road ? 
well that's Georgia with her Mummy . 
well Georgia's quite low down . 
you probably can't see from where you're sitting . 
Georgia's Mummy's a nurse . 
can you see her blue dress ? 
that's a nurse's uniform . 
she works in a hospital . 
you know you have doctors and nurses to make you feel better ? 
they've gone to see Liam . 
and it looks as if they're going out together „ doesn't it ? 
because Liam's Mummy is strapping them both into the car . 
they're a little bit older than you „ aren't they ? 
they both started school last September . 
so they're about five years old now (.) I think . 
and how old (i)s Thomas ? 
how old is Thomas ? 
can you not remember ? 
no . 
we'll go sometime , love . 
you've been quite a lot to the station recently „ haven't we ? 
yeah . 
oops . 
I'm putting some more margarine on this toast . 
it's even crispier than the last lot . 
listen to this . 
don't you ? 
oh [<] dear . 
what would you like to do ? 
you want some quiet ? 
listen . 
another train . 
it didn't go poop poop . 
in fact it sounded like it was going very [/] very quickly „ didn't it ? 
do you ? 
mhm . 
Robert ? 
I don't know . 
is he still in bed ? 
are his bedroom curtains still drawn ? 
oh it's opened „ isn't it ? 
well I don't know . 
he could be doing all sorts . 
you do know Robert's house is up for sale , sweetheart ? 
you've seen the sign outside „ haven't you ? 
well we have been in . 
it's a real shame . 
he's a nice little boy „ isn't he ? 
him and his family . 
Andrew . 
well I think you've only met his Daddy once . 
you've seen his grandparents quite a lot and you know his Mummy very well . 
but I think we've only seen Andrew once . 
they're moving to Macclesfield . 
who else lives in Macclesfield ? 
what about Jill and Bethany ? 
mhm . 
xxx [>] . 
oh it isn't in the clouds . 
no . 
who (h)as got a poorly nose ? 
I know . 
it's because my nose has been running so much . 
Mummy gets allergys to different things , Thomas . 
<would it> [<] cheer my up ? 
have one of your sweets ? 
I'm sure it would . 
&=laughs . 
what ? 
do you need cheering up as well ? 
and you haven't finished your toast or eaten your apple properly . 
you've had one quarter of apple . 
don't you ? 
you're not bothered ? 
why do you not want it ? 
you not hungry ? 
oh . 
does that mean your tummy is full ? 
no room for a sweet then „ is there ? 
no . 
that's room on the table . 
not room in your tummy . 
<no Jill> [<] [//] Jill and Bethany have moved to Macclesfield and when we've been to see them we've gone with Sonia in Sonia's car „ haven't we ? 
and Jake_Jimmy and his Mummy and Daddy have moved to Macclesfield . 
and we've not been to their house yet . 
we should've gone to Jake's party . 
but we didn't go „ did we ? 
well because it was in Macclesfield and nobody <we knew> [/] we knew was going and Daddy was at work that day and needed the car . 
no . 
Jill and Bethany weren't invited I don't think . 
I don't think they know Jo quite like we do . 
<do you> [<] ? 
well (.) shall we have a little bit of Easter egg ? 
because we haven't had any Easter egg for a while . 
don't you ? 
oh . 
another [<] train . 
gosh [<] . 
what on earth are they doing this morning (.) the trains ? 
you think Sonia and Isabelle and Daddy_Rod are on the train going poop poop ? 
I think we've got a +... [+ IN] 
+, a little book somewhere , Thomas . 
it's not a new book but it's new to us . 
about Thomas_The_Tank_Engine and some breakfast . 
shall I go and find it ? 
hm: [=! laughs] . 
I'll just finish this piece of toast and then I'll go and have a look and see if I can find it . 
0 [= laughs] . 
does Mummy's nose look very red ? 
oh that's a shame . 
I think it's the sun as well actually . 
when it's warm weather . 
I like the warm weather very much (.) but all the things in the garden make me sneeze . 
and cuddling Purdie makes me sneeze . 
and Purdie isn't very well so she's getting lots_of cuddles . 
so Purdie's feeling better but Mummy's feeling worse . 
Thomas [<] ! 
no . 
<because it's breakfast> [<] time . 
you have not eaten all your breakfast . 
you don't have sweets . 
no you don't . 
you don't . 
you don't . 
and what's more you're not having them . 
well you can shout and carry on all you like . 
no . 
let's not start this again . 
right . 
definitely not . 
only good boys get sweets . 
if you've still got +/. [+ IN] 
shh ! 
quiet ! 
if you've still got a little gap in your tummy there's some apple there . 
well if you've no gaps you've no room for sweeties . 
right . 
I'm going to find that Thomas_The_Tank_Engine book . 
pardon [>] ? 
you think it's hiding ? 
right . 
there we are . 
well I think Mummy did it . 
I think it was when I was tidying up the newspapers . 
oh goodness me . 
well that (h)as tidied up the &pl [//] plate . 
we've knocked it on the floor . 
it (h)as smashed . 
it (h)as broken . 
never mind . 
we hadn't washed it up „ had we ? 
oh dear [/] dear . 
that's +/. [+ IN] 
mhm . 
well I just used the cloth to wipe the table to get rid of all the crumbs from the toast . 
and as I went to put the cloth back <on the &ta> [//] on the worktop (.) I think my cardigan sleeve must've caught the edge of the plate . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
I hope it wasn't one of the big ones . 
I bet it was . 
let me just check the cupboard . 
oh it was . 
oh dear . 
Mummy xxx this is broken plate . [+ PI] 
we've got to +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
look . 
<we had> [/] we had four large plates and one smaller plate +/. [+ IN] 
+, in the same design . 
and it's one of the large ones unfortunately . 
no . 
because it'll cut you , darling . 
what we'll hafta do now is (.) <you see> [/] you see these edges are really sharp „ aren't they ? 
well if put those in the dustbin bag +... [+ IN] 
well he will collect them away (.) but if the dustbin man picks the bag up and one of the sharp bits poke through the bag (.) it might cut his hand or leg . 
so what we've got to do (.) when we've broken something sharp like that +/. [+ IN] 
we've got to get some newspaper +//. [+ IN] 
another train . 
<a newspaper> [<] or something like that . 
and we've got to wrap it all up so there are no sharp bits . 
and then we can put it in a [/] a bag . 
I'm just going to move (.) Purdie's water bowl because I think some of the little +//. [+ IN] 
when it broke (.) although we've got some big pieces of plate like that +... [+ IN] 
no . 
I don't think Daddy can . 
I think we (h)ad better just put it in the bin , Thomas . 
when it shattered (.) even though it broke in big pieces (.) there are some little pieces of pot . 
let me show you one . 
that are very [/] very sharp . 
and if they've landed on Purdie's water bowl then it (.) isn't very good . 
so we'll get rid of the water . 
look at that . 
that's a little piece of broken pot . 
in fact Auntie_Mabel broke a teapot the other day „ didn't she ? 
what happened then ? 
did Pippin run and bump into her and she dropped it ? 
she hadta go to the shop and buy another one „ didn't she ? 
and they didn't sell them . 
I think her nephew sent her a teapot in the post for a birthday present and she was really proud of it „ wasn't she ? 
a nice brown teapot . 
it looked like ours . 
and then I think Pippin got excited because the postman arrived with Auntie_Mabel's birthday card . 
and Pippin was running round Auntie_Mabel's legs and she tripped up and dropped the teapot and smashed it . 
and she was upset . 
well what happened ? 
did [/] did Pippin jump onto Auntie_Mabel's hand ? 
jumped out of her hand ? 
because she thought “gosh (.) I don't want him to know I've broken it” . 
so she rushed to the shop to buy a replacement one and the lady said “we do sell them (.) but we haven't got any in stock” . 
+" it'll be next week . 
and Auntie_Mabel said I can't wait that long . 
so what did she do ? 
where did she go to with Pippin ? 
she went to the factory shop „ didn't she ? 
and bought one there . 
and then (.) when her nephew arrived at the door (.) Pippin got so excited that she nearly dropped the new one „ didn't she ? 
she didn't quite . 
she caught it in time . 
there . 
let's have a look at this book . 
it's called “Thomas comes to breakfast” . 
we've not read this one before „ have we ? 
who can we see there ? 
there's Gordon . 
that's Henry . 
that's James . 
and that's Percy [>] . 
yes . 
that's Edward . 
and that's Thomas_The_Tank . 
aren't you clever ? 
one two three four five six engines you know . 
right [/] right . 
be careful now . 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine has worked his branch line for many years and knows it very well . [+ R] 
coke trucks ? 
co^co@c trucks ? 
what's a coco@c truck ? 
do you not mean coke ? 
they're carrying coke or coal ? 
coal . 
you know just where to stop , Thomas , laughed his driver . [+ R] 
you could almost manage it without me . [+ R] 
Thomas had become conceited . [+ R] 
he didn't realize that his driver was joking . [+ R] 
<you won't [: won't]> [//] do you know what conceited means ? 
it means he became very [/] very smug and very sure of himself . 
later he boasted to the others . [+ R] 
the driver says I don't need him now . [+ R] 
don't be daft snorted Percy . [+ R] 
I'd never go without my driver said Toby earnestly . [+ R] 
I'd be frightened . 
pooh@q boasted Thomas . [+ R] 
I'm not scared . [+ R] 
you'd never dare said the other engines . [+ R] 
I would though boasted Thomas . [+ R] 
you'll see . 
he's a bit (.) show off is Thomas „ isn't he ? 
well (.) I think this is what the problem is . 
Thomas has decided he's going to go without his driver . 
next morning the firemen came . [+ R] 
Thomas drowsed comfortably in the shed as the warmth spread through his boiler . [+ R] 
Percy and Toby were still asleep . [+ R] 
Thomas opened his eyes and then he suddenly remembered silly stick-in-the-muds . [+ R] 
I'll show them . [+ R] 
the driver hasn't come yet so here goes . [+ R] 
he cautiously tried one piston (.) then the other . [+ R] 
<they're moving> [/] they're moving he whispered . [+ R] 
I'll just go out and I'll stop and go whoosh . [+ R] 
that'll make them jump . [+ R] 
very [/] very quietly he headed past the door . [+ R] 
Thomas thought that he was being clever . [+ R] 
but really he was only moving because a careless cleaner had meddled with his controls . [+ R] 
he is „ isn't he ? 
xxx a smile on his face „ hasn't he ? [+ PI] 
it says (.) Thomas thought that he was being clever . [+ R] 
but really he was only moving because careless [//] a careless cleaner had meddled with his controls . [+ R] 
he soon found out his mistake . [+ R] 
he tried to whoosh but he couldn't . [+ R] 
he tried to stop but he couldn't . [+ R] 
he just kept rolling along . [+ R] 
the buffers will stop me he thought hopefully . [+ R] 
but the siding had no buffers . [+ R] 
Thomas's wheels left the rails and crunched the tarmac . [+ R] 
there was the station master's house . [+ R] 
Thomas didn't dare to look at what was coming next . [+ R] 
the station master and his family were just about to have breakfast . [+ R] 
horrors@q cried Thomas and shut his eyes . [+ R] 
there was a crash ! [+ R] 
and the house rocked and broken glass tinkled . 
plaster peppered the plates . 
well I don't think it's actually +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
I was going to say I don't think it actually shows you but (.) oh dear . 
<on the next page> [>] . 
yes . 
a tree on the line . 
but I think it's Thomas . 
I think it's Thomas has smashed into the fat controller's house . 
a little bit like when that plate broke . 
what did it say on the previous page ? 
crash@o . 
let's read it again . 
there was a crash ! [+ R] 
and the house rocked and broken glass tinkled . [+ R] 
plaster peppered the plates . [+ R] 
that means that probably plaster from the ceiling fell down and scattered all over the plates . 
oh look . 
and Thomas had collected a bush on his travels . [+ R] 
he peered anxiously into the room through it's leaves . [+ R] 
<he couldn't speak> [<] . 
the station master was furious . [+ R] 
the station master's wife picked up her plate “you miserable engine” she scolded . 
+" just look at what you've done to our breakfast . [+ R] 
now I shall hafta cook some more . [+ R] 
oh ! 
she banged the door . [+ R] 
more plaster fell . [+ R] 
this time it fell on Thomas . [+ R] 
you see (.) all the dust and rubble from the ceiling ? 
oh Thomas felt depressed . [+ R] 
that means he felt very sad . 
mhm ? 
when you're depressed you're very sad . 
Thomas felt depressed . [+ R] 
the plaster was tickly . [+ R] 
he wanted to sneeze but he didn't dare in case the house fell on him . [+ R] 
nobody came for a long time . [+ R] 
everyone was much too busy . [+ R] 
well he crashed into the station master's house „ didn't he ? 
because he thought he was clever enough to go on his own without a driver . 
and he wasn't . 
and he got into trouble when he found he couldn't stop . 
pardon ? 
the [<] rope ? 
well I think they're obviously going to hafta try and pull him out „ aren't they ? 
now listen , Thomas . 
you know sometimes when we go out of the front door ? 
and you start running away and I shout stop ? 
now the same sort of thing could happen to you . 
you think “oh I can go down there with Mummy” . 
it's perfectly safe (.) I don't need Mummy . 
but you do sometimes , Thomas . 
because sometimes things happen . 
if you're running quickly and you couldn't stop and a car was coming (.) you might have a bash and a crash . 
so it's always better to wait „ isn't it ? 
like Thomas should have waited for his driver . 
you should wait for Mummy . 
right . 
so now what (h)as happened ? 
it says Thomas was saying nobody came for a long time . 
but it looks now as if some workmen have come . 
well normally I would imagine that's the hook +//. [+ IN] 
listen to the trains this morning . 
I can't get over that . 
I wonder if there's something special going on ? 
they're all going poop poop . 
I think that hook would normally couple the engine to the (.) carriage . 
the last workman propped up the house with strong poles and laid rails through the garden . [+ R] 
that must be like scaffolding that we see on building sites holding up buildings . 
not if you wanna turn the page . 
do you wanna see what's going on underneath ? 
do you know who they are ? 
who are they ? 
they're twins . 
Donald and Douglas . 
we [/] we met them in another story at Christmas . 
well I don't know (.) they're identical . 
but we'll call that one (.) Donald and that one Douglas . 
I don't know which is which . 
I'm sure they have different numbers on the engines . 
are they number nine and ten or ten and eleven ? 
something like that . 
we came across them at Christmas , Thomas . 
in that story about Thomas and the Christmas tree . 
because Donald and Douglas were the ones who shunted Thomas_The_Tank_Engine out of the snow . 
at last workmen propped up the house with strong poles . [+ R] 
and laid rails through the garden . [+ R] 
Donald and Douglas arrived . [+ R] 
ah (.) they must be Scottish . 
because they're saying [/] they're saying something about “we'll soon have you back on the rails they laughed” . 
but they way it's written it sounds (.) “we'll soon ha(ve) you back on the rails” they laughed . 
I can't do the accent . 
puffing hard the twins managed to haul Thomas back to safety . [+ R] 
so I think that train is onto [=? under] Thomas . 
and look it must be on the back of Donald and Douglas . 
bits of fencing (.) the bush and a broken window frame festooned Thomas's front . [+ R] 
that means they were all over Thomas's front . 
which was badly twisted . [+ R] 
he looked very funny . [+ R] 
<the twins> [<] laughed and laughed at him . [+ R] 
Thomas was in disgrace . [+ R] 
but there was worse to come . [+ R] 
that means Thomas is in a lot of trouble . 
you are a very naughty engine came a voice . [+ R] 
“I know , Sir” said Thomas . [+ R] 
+" I'm sorry , Sir . [+ R] 
Thomas's voice was muffled behind his bush . [+ R] 
look . 
can you see ? 
he (h)as got a bit of bush and all sorts on his face . 
you must go to the works and have your front end mended . [+ R] 
it will be a long job said the fat controller . [+ R] 
“oh yes , Sir” faltered Thomas . 
meanwhile a Diesel rail car called Daisy will do your work . [+ R] 
I think that happened before „ didn't it ? 
Daisy stepped into the [/] (.) the breach before „ hasn't she ? 
when something (h)as happened to Thomas . 
<a a> [/] a <&d &d> [//] diesel , Sir ? 
yes , Thomas (.) said the fat controller . [+ R] 
diesels always stay in their sheds till they are wanted . [+ R] 
diesels never gallivant off to breakfast in Station_Master's houses . [+ R] 
the fat controller turned on his heels and sternly walked away .[+ R] 
oh_gosh ! 
now I think that should teach Thomas +//. [+ IN] 
&=laughs . 
another one ! 
that should teach Thomas a lesson „ shouldn't it ? 
he should not have gone off on his own „ should he ? 
so +//. [+ IN] 
and , Thomas , you must learn from that story . 
you must never go off on your own . 
why are you looking cheeky ? 
it's only because I love you that I don't want you to go off on your own . 
what would Mummy do if you got knocked down by a car ? 
she'd cry „ wouldn't she ? 
I'd have no one to play with . 
<I couldn't go> [<] to bang^a^drum^time@c because there'd be no one to go with . 
Jeannine [<] wouldn't bother coming to see you (.) because you wouldn't be here . 
Grandma and Granddad wouldn't hafta come . 
I'd go to The_Beehive and I'd just sit there on my own . 
so when we do things let's do <things together> [>] . 
would I run fast ? 
<no but> [<] if you ran out in front of a car you might not be running anywhere . 
so (.) you be like Thomas and you wait . 
yes ? 
we've not read that book before „ have we ? 
it was quite nice . 
oh , Ticklemouse ! 
look . 
that's right . 
because on the back of the book it tells you all the other books that are in the range . 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
the animals of Farthing_Wood . 
oh that says trouble in the park . 
do you think that's one of the +//. [+ IN] 
oh no that's animals of Farthing_Wood . 
I was going to say is that Percy_the_Park_Keeper (.) but it's not . 
who's that ? 
Rubert_the_Bear . 
and who's that ? 
Winnie_the_Pooh . 
and who's that ? 
Fireman_Sam . 
right . 
is it time to leave the table now ? 
shall we have a wash ? 
no . 
Thomas , please let's not start this again . 
later on if you're a good boy . 
<not straight> [<] after your breakfast . 
oh I know . 
I know but you've just finished your breakfast . 
I'll go and get a sponge and we'll give you a wash . 
you telling Purdie <to stay> [>] inside ? 
oh ! 
what's this ? 
a honey nut loop from breakfast ? 
or a dustbin bag ? 
something really funny happened „ didn't it ? 
a little while ago . 
we put the video on . 
and there was Auntie_Mabel with the [//] the episode about the teapot . 
and we (h)ad been talking about the teapot earlier on „ hadn't we ? 
and I must admit I (h)ad never watched it through before . 
I got the gist of what happened (.) that Auntie_Mabel broke the teapot that her nephew gave her . 
and she hadta go get another one . 
but I never actually sat down and watched the whole program . 
and I realized that it showed you her going to the factory where they were making teapots . 
yes . 
that's right . 
the lady in the shop said they were sold out . 
and [>] +... [+ IN] 
yes . 
well she went to the shop and the [/] the lady in the shop said she was sold out . 
she wouldn't get one for another week so she went the factory . 
and it showed them pouring clay into moulds . 
and after they (h)ad poured the clay into moulds they baked the clay . 
and then they dipped it in a brown glaze and fired it again in the kiln (.) in a big oven . 
and it came out all brown and shiny and Auntie_Mabel said “just what I need” . 
but the man said “I'm sorry these are all sold” . 
it was for a special order „ wasn't it ? 
so she rushed off to find a potter and the potter said “I'll make you one but you must find me some clay” because he (h)ad run out of clay . 
so she ran to the &qu [//] quarry and she picked up a lump of clay . 
and she was talking to one of the workmen and he said “oh you can't make teapots out of a piece of clay like that” . 
+" something hasta be added to it . 
+" you can't take it straight from the ground . 
so he gave her a big lump of clay „ didn't he ? 
and she took it back to the potter (.) and what did the potter do ? 
he made a teapot . 
did he have a [/] a turntable ? 
and what was he doing with his hands ? 
on the clay . 
that's right . 
you're showing me „ aren't you ? 
he put his hands in . 
he put his hands in and the turntable was spinning round and round . 
the clay was going everywhere and +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
but in the end there was a beautiful teapot . 
and he baked it „ didn't he ? 
and then what did he dip it in ? 
some dark woods ? 
some dark brown glaze „ didn't he ? 
and he fired it up again (.) and she got a perfect teapot . 
and then she took it home and then when her nephew arrived (.) the doorbell rang and she popped the teapot on the table „ didn't she ? 
went to answer the door (.) Pippin was excited and he knocked the table and +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
she caught the teapot just in time „ didn't she ? 
but the other thing I hadn't realized is that when they went to the shop to buy the teapot in the first place . 
the shop was full of all sorts of different pots „ wasn't it ? 
and there was a big plant stand „ wasn't there ? 
on the floor . 
yeah . 
and Pippin bumped into it „ didn't he ? 
as Auntie_Mabel said “come on , Pippin , time to leave” (.) Pippin bumped into the pot and we could see it wobble . 
and as they left the shop we heard an almighty +... [+ IN] 
+, crash ? 
a big crash and a bash . 
we've got a brown teapot like Auntie_Mabel had . 
0 [=! blowing nose] . 
sorry about this , Tommy . 
I'll just wash my hands . 
I know . 
the trains are still going poop poop . 
they were doing it yesterday a lot as well „ weren't they ? 
but I didn't really think anything about it yesterday . 
there we are . 
I've washed my hands . 
now (.) what have we got under the tea cosy ? 
we've got a brown teapot just like Auntie_Mabel . 
you can touch it as long as we don't drop it . 
because Mummy (h)as had that for a long [/] long time . 
are you ? 
look . 
brown teapot . 
there's the lid . 
what does it say ? 
made in England (.) on the inside . 
oh be careful . 
<gently gently> [/] gently , Thomas . 
isn't it nice and shiny though ? 
that's right . 
well she sang a little song „ didn't she ? 
we sing it at playgroup . 
I'm a little teapot . [+ R] 
<short and stout> [<] . [+ R] 
here's my handle . [+ R] 
here's my spout . [+ R] 
when I see the tea cups hear me shout . [+ R] 
tip me up and pour me +... [+ IN] [+ R] 
+, out [<] . [+ R] 
look . 
that's the stand that the tea pot stands on . 
what's that shaped like ? 
like a flower pot . 
it's shaped like a teapot . 
it (h)as got flowers on it . 
well when we've put hot water in there to make hot tea we must keep it in the middle of the table , Thomas . 
because if it falls on the floor I'll be very [/] very upset . 
when we've put hot tea in . 
we put this on . 
this is like a tea cosy . 
you feel this . 
does it feel like a nice padded hat ? 
we pop the tea cosy on the tea pot like that and it keeps the tea nice and warm . 
yes . 
we've got another tea pot „ haven't we ? 
look at this tea pot . 
this is the tea pot that Mummy uses every day . 
oh you +//. [+ IN] 
but be careful , Tom . 
be careful . 
let's put this one in the middle of the table now . 
this one is a metal one . 
it's stainless steel . 
it hasn't been made like this one „ has it ? 
with clay ? 
I don't know how that one (h)as been made but it (h)as not been made the same . 
what's the difference with the lid ? 
you lift the lid up (.) but look it's on a hinge . 
can you see that ? 
that lid never comes off „ does it ? 
it stays on the tea pot . 
it opens and it closes . 
but this one (.) you take the lid off . 
look inside . 
no . 
just a bit of water from when we washed it . 
which is the handle ? 
which is the +//. [+ IN] 
oops . 
which is the spout ? 
and which is the lid ? 
that's right . 
we'll pop the lid on that one . 
we've got some more tea pots „ haven't we ? 
let's have a little look at these up here . 
this one (.) has a pattern on it . 
this matches the room service . 
look . 
we can't +//. [+ IN] 
yes . 
but we won't play with this one . 
can you see the pattern on it ? 
look . 
that's a very big tea pot . 
look inside there . 
can you see the holes there ? 
well you pour the tea in and it comes out of the spout „ doesn't it ? 
no . 
not too near the edge of the table , Thomas , (.) please . 
<you can have the lid> [<] +... [+ IN] 
no . 
gently put the lid on . 
gently . 
that's it . 
now this one especially . 
that's it . 
it (h)as got a special little lip „ hasn't it ? 
and (.) we've got another teapot up here . 
now this one (.) matches the other dinner set . 
well we can't (.) play with this . 
we can't play with this one . 
this one's very precious . 
look . 
what (h)as it got on it ? 
what (h)as it got on it ? 
what can you see ? 
flowers and +... [+ IN] 
what [>] +... [+ IN] 
just a minute . 
what (h)as it got on here ? 
what (h)as it got on it ? 
some butterflys ? 
butterflys . 
<and pour me out> [<] . [+ R] 
can you see there are different shapes ? 
this is a very round one „ isn't it ? 
and that one's quite a tall one . 
that's the coffee pot . 
oh be careful , Tom . 
don't <bang the lid down , darling> [>] . 
and look . 
what's this ? 
do you know what this tall pot is called ? 
do you know what this tall pot is called , Thomas ? 
what's this one ? 
it (h)as got butterflys on it as well . 
look inside there . 
that's deep „ isn't it ? 
now which one's the teapot ? 
out of these two which one's the teapot ? 
which one ? 
<which one> [<] ? 
this one ? 
and which one's the coffee pot ? 
which one ? 
no . 
that's a tea pot . 
is the tall one a coffee pot ? 
no . 
that's a tea pot . 
what do we put in there ? 
tea bags ? 
for tea ? 
you'd like some tea ? 
and look (.) I think the books might fall out when I move this . 
look . 
another coffee pot . 
just [<] a second . 
look . 
a coffee pot and a tea pot in that set . 
and coffee pot and tea pot in this set . 
you did . 
yes . 
you did . 
now <let me> [>] show you this , Thomas . 
no . 
you mustn't touch . 
you must <just look> [>] . 
no . 
because look . 
listen [/] listen . 
listen . 
I know . 
but listen to me . 
what happens +/. [+ IN] 
what happened <with the tea> [>] +... [+ IN] 
what happened with the tea pot ? 
Pippin and Auntie_Mabel dropped it and broke it . 
we don't want that to happen . 
listen . 
you can look at it (.) just don't be rough . 
you don't snatch things , Thomas . 
that's how things get broken . 
now look . 
do you know what happened in here ? 
I was just about to show you in there . 
that doesn't look very nice inside that lid „ does it ? 
because one day (.) before we lived in this house . 
when Mummy and Daddy were first married we has some friends round for a meal . 
and then at the end of the meal we went to make some coffee and Mummy went to get the pot out of the cupboard . 
and I knocked it over and the lid smashed . 
oh ! 
and it really upset me because we couldn't buy a new lid . 
so can you see what Mummy (h)as done ? 
she stuck it back together with some glue . 
yeah . 
you can see where all the glue (h)as dried inside . 
so that doesn't look very nice „ does it ? 
but the thing is when we've got guests now we <don't use that coffee pot> [>] . 
what's the matter ? 
Thomas , what is the matter ? 
what's the matter ? 
<oh you're just making a xxx > [<] . [+ PI] 
Tom . 
you're laughing . 
you're laughing and crying together . 
you don't know <what to do> [>] . 
shh . 
now listen . 
when people come round now (.) what do we do ? 
we use this coffee pot . 
but this one stands on the shelf . 
on the welsh dresser and no one can actually see the lid's broken . 
because look . 
that's the crack at the back . 
and we turn it like that „ don't we ? 
now what was the other thing that Auntie_Mabel while she was at the factory ? 
she bought herself a new tea pot . 
do you want me to dry your eyes ? 
oh you'll do it yourself „ will you ? 
and she bought +//. [+ IN] 
what did she say she bought ? 
a new tea pot for herself and two new bowls for [>] +... [+ IN] 
you want a sweetie for me ? 
you've got a hair in your eye . 
let me just take it out . 
she bought two new bowls for Pippin „ didn't she ? 
what would you like to share ? 
oh , Thomas . 
stop talking about sweeties . 
you're not having a sweetie . 
especially the way you're carrying on at the moment . 
look . 
these are two pot bowls for Purdie . 
do you think they've been made the same way as the tea pot ? 
with the clay ? 
and what [/] what does that say on it ? 
c@l a@l t@l [= says phonetically] . 
cat . 
that's the bowl that Purdie has her water in . 
we emptied that this morning . 
and look at this one . 
this one was a bowl Purdie got for Christmas . 
Daddy bought her this . 
<look it's> [<] +... [+ IN] 
in Sainsburys I think . 
look it (h)as got (.) fish on it . 
can you see the fish running round the outside ? 
well they're swimming „ aren't they ? 
not running . 
and do you know what that says , Thomas ? 
two thousand . 
because Daddy bought it at Christmas (.) just before the Millennium . 
do you remember the Millennium ? 
<the year> [<] two thousand ? 
you're rolling it ? 
you're rolling Purdie's bowl ? 
so this one she has her crunchy biscuits in . 
and the one you're holding is her water bowl . 
if you drop it on the floor there'll be trouble , Thomas , because [>] you've been warned . 
yes ? 
do you know what that says on the back of that ? 
let's have a look . 
it (h)as got a little stamp on the bottom and it says +//. [+ IN] 
oh can't read it . 
&=laughs . 
oven and freezer proof . 
microwave and dishwasher safe . 
oh that's good „ isn't it ? 
I'm sure I'm going to microwave and freeze Purdie's water . 
<and pour me out> [<] . [+ R] 
it says made in +/. [+ IN] 
+, Chesterfield (.) England . 
&=laughs . 
I'm a little tea pot . [+ R] 
short and stout . [+ R] 
here's my handle . [+ R] 
here's my spout . [+ R] 
when I see the tea cups hear me shout . [+ R] 
tip me up and pour me out . [+ R] 
shall I put some water in this tea pot for you ? 
and get you a little cup ? 
so [>] +... [+ IN] 
there you are a tiny bit . 
because you can pretend it's a cup of tea . 
look and we've got a nice cup here . 
<this is your> [<] [/] this is your Tigger [//] Winnie_the_Pooh and Tinny [//] Tigger cup „ isn't it ? 
there you are . 
the water's in there . 
not wait until we get to the bit in the song where it's “tip me up and pour me out” . 
&=laughs . 
we've got to sing the song first . 
I'm a little tea pot short and stout . [+ R] 
here's [>] my handle . [+ R] 
<here's my spout> [>] . [+ R] 
when I see the tea cup hear me shout . [+ R] 
tip me up and +... [+ IN] [+ R] 
+, pour me +... [+ IN] [+ R] 
out . [+ R] 
oops . 
&=laughs . 
you see that's only cold water in that tea pot „ isn't it ? 
but when Mummy makes tea (.) what's the water like ? 
is it very hot ? 
are you going to pour it back <in the &cu> [//] in the tea pot ? 
very good . 
I'd love a cup of tea please . 
shall we sing the song again ? 
not yet . 
you're just going to pour it „ are you ? 
tell you what . 
let's put the tea pots down there and stand the tea pot on the tea pot stand . 
because a proper cup of tea would be really [/] really hot . 
then it would mark the table „ wouldn't it ? 
so we stand it on a tea pot stand . 
and could I have a drop of milk in there please ? 
alright . 
well I don't usually take sugars . 
but never mind . 
if you wanna put some in (.) that's fine . 
oh thank you so much . 
can I give you a kiss ? 
are you a cafe man ? 
do you work in a cafe ? 
making [<] cups of tea ? 
a restaurant ? 
oh Kit_Kat . 
yes . 
you were thinking of when you go to John_Lewis . 
or [//] I think it's Tesco you have Kit_Kat and cups of tea . 
but you go to John_Lewis with Nana and Granddad „ don't you ? 
and have a shortbread biscuit . 
right . 
I'll just drink this . 
glug^glug^glug@o . 
oh_gosh . 
I'm so thirsty . 
it's such a hot day . 
I'd like another cup of tea please . 
would that be any trouble ? 
oh is it coffee now ? 
oh right . 
oh I'll have some coffee instead then please . 
I'm a little tea pot short and stout . [+ R] 
here's my handle . [+ R] 
here's my spout . [+ R] 
when I hear the tea cups see me +/. [+ IN] 
I'm getting mixed up with the words . 
when I see the tea cups hear me shout . [+ R] 
lift me up and +... [+ IN] [+ R] 
++ out . [+ R] 
I'd love a cup of tea please . 
when Mummy was a little girl Grandma useta use tea leaves (.) not tea bags . 
you know at the moment Mummy just opens the tea kettle and pops a bag in ? 
and then puts some boiling water from the kettle . 
<oh that's wonderful> [<] . 
Grandma useta put spoons [//] spoonfuls of tea leaves in the tea pot and then pour in boiling water . 
and we useta have a little strainer . 
a tea strainer . 
Mummy (h)as got some somewhere . 
I don't know where it is . 
and we useta put the strainer on the cup and then pour the tea out . 
and the strainer would catch our tea leaves . 
do you remember when Mummy's cooking pasta for you ? 
we have a colander don't we ? 
so I pour (.) the pasta into the colander and it catches all the pasta but all the water drains through ? 
well that's the same with the tea strainer . 
let me see if I can find it . 
are you ? 
that's very nice . 
am I welcome ? 
no . 
I really don't know what (h)as happened to this tea strainer . 
it useta hang up there . 
I can't think that anybody would have used it for anything . 
how very strange . 
no . 
it's not in there either . 
we've got the sieve and the colander there . 
but (.) no tea strainer . 
no . 
don't know where it is . 
this [<] is a tea bag „ isn't it ? 
can you see the tea bag's round ? 
this tea bag's round . 
sometimes they're square . 
<and they're even> [<] +... [+ IN] 
oh no . 
because [/] because that's only cold water . 
we'll keep this until we need a proper cup of tea . 
you smell that . 
look . 
can you see inside this bag ? 
all these little tea leaves ? 
can you see them ? 
well those are the leaves that useta be loose . 
we've got round tea bags and square tea bags . 
and we've even had some that are shaped like <a triangle> [//] a pyramid . 
are you having good fun making a cup of tea for Mummy ? 
I think I'll just put this tea pot and coffee pot back , Thomas , now . 
xxx [>] . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
have you spilt it ? 
well don't tip the cup up . 
hold the cup up properly . 
you see . 
that's a good job that's cold water „ isn't it ? 
because if it (h)as been hot (.) you would have got burnt . 
scalded . 
shall I just wipe it up ? 
there you are . 
have you got wet on your clothes ? 
just a little bit ? 
there you are . 
would you like to just dry yourself with your towel . 
oh it's only a little spot . 
did it feel cold ? 
I [<] bet it felt cold when it landed on your legs . 
you want some more cup of tea ? 
you'd like me to get you some more water ? 
there we are . 
we've put the tea and coffee pot back (.) up there . 
I'll just put this one away . 
that's right . 
hold it near you . 
otherwise it'll get spilt again „ won't it ? 
this tea pot goes back on the shelf here . 
everything up here , Thomas , all the cups and the plates and the saucers . 
<look there are some> [<] jugs here . 
oh [>] . 
oh (.) have your pretend you put some milk in the bowl for Purdie ? 
look . 
can you see this milk jug ? 
this is made the same way . 
it's all made with clay . 
like you saw the tea pot being made . 
but the difference is these all have a pattern on them . 
so I think they must do something different . 
they paint they pattern on „ don't they ? 
they don't just dip them in a glaze like Auntie_Mabel's plain brown tea pot . 
you having good fun pouring that out ? 
can I have another cup of tea please ? 
pardon ? 
you're not selling more cups of tea ? 
why ? 
has the cafe shut ? 
oh poor , Mummy . 
so I'll hafta go home (.) thirsty . 
is it open ? 
oh can I have a cup of tea please ? 
thank you . 
is it ? 
oh but you just promised me a cup of tea .
