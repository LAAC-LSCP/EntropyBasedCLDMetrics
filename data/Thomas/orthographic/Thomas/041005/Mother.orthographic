I'll [<] tell you what though . 
from <this set> [//] this bath time set . 
oh [<] I don't know where it is now . 
you've got a foot and a hand .

<an &ex> [<] [//] an extra foot .

is to build some (.) steps . 
oh goodness me . 
which half does Pilchard live at ? 
got a lot of houses <has he> [>] [?] . 
Thomas [<] , not so much noise . 
<well I think> [<] +/. [+ IN] 
this lifeboat might have come along .

Scoop's scoopy@n part of his digger ? 
and he just lowered him into the water as a joke ? 
and then when I wasn't looking he went zoop@o . 
and boinged him back up . 
I [<] bet if there are any crocodiles in the water . 
they got a bit of a surprise .

do you think so ? 
what have you hidden behind those bubbles ? 
did he ? 
xxx [<] . 
<I'll [<] send> [?] old Scoop to the rescue ?

to lift him up again .
