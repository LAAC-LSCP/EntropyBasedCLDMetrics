what's that ? 
chip shops . 
oh be careful . 
you're dropping it . 
is that the truck ? 
it's the wheelbarrow . 
we've been to Isabel's house today „ haven't we ? 
have we been to Isabel's house ? 
yes . 
that's right . 
with the steps . 
we went this morning to see Isabel „ didn't we ? 
that's right . 
yes . 
they had Thomas_The_Tank_Engine on the video . 
they were watching something else „ weren't they ? 
they were watching Teletubbies . 
and you said choo_choos@f over and over again and in the end they put Thomas_The_Tank_Engine on the video because where you first saw that video +/. [+ IN] 
+, at Isabel's house . 
and we had some lunch . 
we've had cheese and pasta sauce . 
no . 
we haven't . 
we've had pasta and cheese sauce „ haven't we ? 
and some sandwiches . 
and some yoghurt and some fruit . 
and you've been playing in the garden „ haven't you ? 
with Isabel and Bethany . 
and Bethany's Mummy Jill +/. [+ IN] 
baby poo . 
yes . 
Isabel used her potty while we were there „ didn't she ? 
yes . 
and Isabel likes Pooh_Bear . 
they've got Pooh_Bear everywhere „ haven't they ? 
she (h)as got a lovely dressing+gown with Pooh_Bear on it . 
and she (h)as got a lot of Pooh_Bear toys . 
and Pooh_Bear bath toys . 
yes . 
yes . 
and you were playing but we couldn't play in the sand+pit today because it looked as if it was going to rain „ didn't it ? 
so we kept the lid of the sand+pit closed . 
choo_choos@f . 
yes . 
sorry . 
Mummy's blowing her nose . 
I think it's being out in the garden . 
Mummy's nose tickles . 
choo_choos@f . 
and it's making her sneeze . 
you were playing „ weren't you ? 
you were running round the garden together . 
and what else were you doing ? 
you were playing with your Teletubby ball . 
baby football . 
yes . 
it was quite a small ball „ wasn't it ? 
small ball . 
two footballs . 
and she had a nice slide „ didn't she ? 
you were playing on the slide with Bethany . 
yes . 
that's right . 
Bethany sat on the little wooden chair at a wooden table to eat her lunch „ didn't she ? 
but she's quite young compared to you and Isabel . 
and Isabel sat on a big chair . 
and you were wandering all over the place . 
you didn't really wanna sit down „ did you ? 
till we restrained you . 
yes . 
be careful now . 
what are you doing ? 
are you tipping your trucks into your highchair ? 
that's a xxx . [+ PI] 
what is it ? 
po@c trucks . 
the red truck . 
I think Mummy oughta shake the tablecloth outside or we oughta wipe it because we've got some crumbs „ haven't we ? 
we were in such a hurry this morning we didn't really have time to clear up properly „ did we ? 
two trucks . 
just pop them on there a moment while Mummy shakes the tablecloth outside . 
looks like Purdie's going to come in . 
what are you doing ? 
it isn't really a football that „ is it ? 
it's a stone [?] for one of the trucks . 
you're making a lot of noise „ aren't you ? 
Thomas , don't drop them on the floor please . 
oh right . 
are you still talking about the steps this morning ? 
you enjoyed playing on those steps „ didn't you ? 
you weren't really playing . 
you were just walking up and down . 
I'd be very surprised if you weren't tired now . 
it uses up a lot of energy „ doesn't it ? 
walking up and [>] down steps . 
blue trucks . 
at Isabel's house you were playing with a wheelbarrow „ weren't you ? 
why don't you put those trucks into the wheelbarrow ? 
where's the wheelbarrow ? 
is it behind you ? 
that was quite funny „ wasn't it ? 
because we've wanted to get you a wheelbarrow for a very long time . 
and we bought that (.) at the weekend . 
and we went to Isabel's and she (h)as got an identical wheelbarrow . 
and that's so you can help Mummy in the garden during the Summer when Mummy (h)as got to do some jobs outside . 
Nin_Nin . 
jobs . 
you can come along with the wheelbarrow . 
and what else can you put in the wheelbarrow ? 
you have a rake . 
yes . 
and a rake and a spade and some buckets and some plant pots . 
it's a nice set „ isn't it ? 
well you've put the wheelbarrow on the table . 
but you're going to hafta move it . 
because I'm putting the cloth back now . 
yes . 
it's the wheelbarrow . 
can you say wheelbarrow ? 
it's another name for truck „ isn't it ? 
it's a barrow . 
but it (h)as got one wheel on the front . 
it's a wheelbarrow . 
<just put it on the floor> [/] just put it on the floor . 
no . 
<where's Mummy's cloth> [//] where's the green cloth Mummy was using a minute ago ? 
oh here it is . 
now it (h)as fallen off the table and everything (h)as fallen on the floor . 
come on . 
why don't you put it on the floor ? 
no . 
but , Thomas . 
Mummy's busy trying to get the table and chairs back together . 
no . 
we don't want it on the dining+room table anymore . 
<just a minute> [/] just a minute . 
wait . 
why do you wanna put it up there ? 
what (h)as happened to the helicopter ? 
if you're putting all these toys in the wheelbarrow why don't you go and get the helicopter ? 
now Thomas , just wait . 
Mummy's trying to put the tablecloth back on the table . 
we've wiped the table and we've wiped the chairs . 
and now we've still got this to do . 
I think it's a bit silly putting a wheelbarrow on a table . 
wheelbarrows belong in the garden „ don't they ? 
what else came with the wheelbarrow ? 
you got a little lawnmower as well „ didn't you ? 
but we have put that outside because that makes a clickety_clickety_click@o sound when you're using it . 
Thomas , we don't want it on the table „ do we ? 
no . 
it's making too much noise . 
I'm going to take it away . 
not on the table . 
Thomas , listen . 
you can't see what's going up there because you're only little . 
look . 
put it on the floor . 
why don't you put it on your table ? 
well I'm going to take the wheelbarrow and xxx . [+ PI] 
oh dear . 
look . 
did these come with the wheelbarrow ? 
a nice bucket and some flowerpots . 
and where's the watering can , Thomas ? 
look at these nice flowerpots . 
yellow pots . 
and a red pot . 
blue bucket . 
and there's the hoe . 
we use that to get the weeds out of the garden . 
and then there's a rake (.) for raking up the grass . 
so Daddy (h)as cut the grass with a lawnmower . 
or you can cut the grass now with your lawnmower „ can't you ? 
and where's the yellow watering can ? 
oh here we are . 
it's a nice yellow watering can . 
I'm not quite sure what this is . 
I'm sure there's a special name for this , Thomas . 
but it looks to me as if it's something +/. [+ IN] 
be careful with Purdie . 
it looks as if it's something you might push into the ground to make holes so that you can put either seeds or plants in the holes . 
yes . 
where's Purdie ? 
so that's a nice gardening set „ isn't it ? 
so you've already got some things upstairs in the bathroom „ haven't you ? 
that's right . 
are you raking the carpet like you would rake the grass outside ? 
what happens when we cut the grass ? 
<snip_snip_snip@o> [/] snip_snip_snip@o . 
because in the bathroom you've already got a watering can and a bucket . 
and <a spade and a rake> [//] a spade and a fork but they're only very small „ aren't they ? 
I suppose it's a trowel and a fork really +/. [+ IN] 
+, to put plants in the garden . [+ IN] 
yes . 
that's a rake , Thomas . 
a rake . 
Daddy and Granddad have rakes but theirs are big . 
that's a watering can . 
you fill it with water and then you go round and water the plants . 
because the plants and the flowers need water to grow „ don't they ? 
they're flowerpots . 
what color's the flowerpot ? 
yellow . 
it's the yellow flowerpot . 
another yellow flowerpot . 
and a red flowerpot . 
that's three flowerpots . 
that's the blue bucket with the green handle . 
have you seen these flowerpots , Thomas ? 
they're all different sizes that stack inside one another . 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
excuse me . 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
poor Mummy's sneezing because we've been out in the garden „ haven't we ? 
I don't think you needta rake the fireguard „ do you ? 
and look at each pot , Thomas . 
they have stripes . 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
and the gardener is outside cutting the grass „ isn't he ? 
so that's not helping Mummy sneezing . 
hello , Purdie . 
Purdie's meowing „ isn't she ? 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
yes . 
be careful , Thomas . 
right . 
do you wanna go out , Puss ? 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
oh that's one of the Teletubbies talking to her . 
why are you smacking Mummy ? 
Mummy's only blowing her nose , Thomas ? 
I think Mummy might hafta have a tablet . 
yes . 
Mummy's tablets . 
I think Mummy's tablets are upstairs „ aren't they ? 
Thomas ! 
juice . 
would you like some more juice ? 
<well where do you think the beaker is with the juice then> [//] where's the beaker with the juice , Thomas ? 
oh is that your toy telephone ? 
are you talking on the telephone ? 
are you talking on the telephone ? 
xxx . 
is that what you were saying ? 
byebye . 
Thomas , Mummy's just going upstairs for a moment to get a tablet . 
I'll be back in a moment . 
you keep talking to whoever you were talking on the telephone while I'm away . 
yes . 
oh are you still talking to someone on the telephone ? 
is that your toy telephone ? 
what are you saying to them ? 
what are you saying to whoever you were talking to ? 
oh dear . 
we've got a lot of things on the floor „ haven't we ? 
right . 
we've got all these things , Thomas . 
what a lot of things in the wheelbarrow . 
oh dear . 
I think we're going to buy you a sand+pit „ aren't we , Thomas ? 
we didn't play in Isabel's sand+pit this morning . 
we didn't take the cover off but last xxx . [+ PI] 
yes . 
it was blue „ wasn't it ? 
Isabel's sand+pit was shaped like a shell and it had two halves . 
one half was filled with sand and the other half had nothing in it . 
and we closed up and it [/] folded up and made a lid . 
but you could have sand in both sides or water in both sides . 
or sand in one and water in the other . 
and last week when we went to Bethany's house she had a sand+pit . 
but her's was actually an old pond built in the garden „ wasn't it ? 
and they drained it of water and filled it with sand . 
that was very large . 
and we've got to buy you a sand+pit . 
but we're not quite sure which one to get . 
we've seen one . 
no . 
it's not juice . 
it's water . 
we've seen one sand+pit that looks like a table with some small legs . 
you can either have it as a table or take the legs off and it can go on the floor . 
I think that might be quite good because I think +/. [+ IN] 
are you taking my shoes off ? 
I think if it's <on the table> [//] on little legs it might stop Purdie going in it . 
because pussy+cats like playing in sand+pits . 
oh don't you start tickling my feet or I shall be giggling ? 
are you having a lie+down now ? 
so look , Thomas . 
at all those things . 
if we were going to the beach and playing in the sand like you were this morning +/. [+ IN] 
+, we could take our buckets . 
look . 
here's [*] two buckets . 
how many buckets are here ? 
that's the blue bucket . 
and what color's the handle ? 
green . 
and what about this bucket ? 
yellow handle . 
a red bucket . 
now what can you tell me about those two buckets ? 
this one , Thomas . 
<is round> [//] this is round . 
and this one is square . 
square . 
the red one is square . 
the blue one is round . 
and this is known as a sand shaker . 
you could either put this in sand or water . 
and as you scoop the sand you can watch it all drain through these holes . 
the same with the water . 
have you put the buckets in the wheelbarrow and they're going for a ride ? 
yes . 
you've found the old Easter_Egg box with Fireman_Sam on that you use as a tunnel for your trains . 
this is something else you could play with in the sand , Thomas . 
it's the shape of a crab . 
look . 
yes . 
a red car . 
a@p choo_choos@f box . 
the choo_choos@f are back in the box . 
look at this . 
this is like a crab . 
Thomas , can you see the shell ? 
and if you were in the sand you could make shapes with the sand . 
shapes . 
and these three flowerpots from your gardening set you could make small sandcastles with those . 
and when you were in the garden you've got a rake and a hoe . 
and I really can't think what this is called . 
I think it's something like a dibber@q but I'm not sure . 
yes . 
it looks like a pear „ doesn't it ? 
only it's far more pointed than the end of a pear . 
but I think you pop it into the soil . 
make a hole and then you can either put plants in or seeds . 
yes . 
yes . 
are you looking for the train ? 
we'll have a look in the dining+room in a moment . 
this is the trowel and fork , Thomas . 
you've seen Mummy use a trowel and fork <when I use> [//] when I do the hanging baskets and the tubs . 
and once we've planted all the flowers and the seeds +/. [+ IN] 
+, we'll hafta keep them watered . [+ IN] 
well it isn't too messy , Thomas . 
really . 
we've got a lot of gardening things on the floor but they're all clean . 
blue bus . 
is that the roof from the blue bus ? 
how many watering cans have I got here , Thomas [/] Thomas ? 
are there three watering cans ? 
and two of them are yellow [//] completely yellow . 
and this one has a yellow handle but the spout is green and the can itself is red . 
three watering cans . 
this watering can is round . 
and it came with the red bucket which is square . 
this bucket round and it came with this watering can which is square . 
that's funny „ isn't it ? 
we have a round bucket and a square bucket . 
and a square watering can and a round watering can . 
oh have you gone for a lie+down ? 
are you very tired ? 
yes . 
are you tired after your time outside in the garden this morning ? 
did the two girls wear you out ? 
Isabel with her Pooh_Bear . 
look . 
if I put the sand shaker on the bucket (.) the fork and the trowel fit in there quite nicely „ don't they ? 
and the watering can sits on top . 
yes . 
oh you're having a lie+down „ are you ? 
night_night [/] night_night , Thomas . 
are you saying night_night to Purdie ? 
here you are . 
here's the toy telephone . 
would you like to ring Daddy up at work and tell him you're going to sleep . 
and say night_night to him . 
so what did you say ? 
hello , Daddy . 
I'm going to sleep . 
byebye . 
did you not ask him how he was ? 
ring him again and have another chat to him . 
what was Daddy asking you ? 
is Thomas going to sleep ? 
can you hear all that noise ? 
it's the gardeners outside . 
they're not cutting our grass I don't think today because Daddy and Granddad did it yesterday . 
we thought the gardeners had forgotten to come so we did it ourselves . 
and they're here today . 
yes . 
wet . 
<are you wet> [//] you're not wet „ are you ? 
you do look tired . 
should Mummy make you a drink of milk ? 
and would you like to sit in your chair and drink some milk ? 
and perhaps you'll <go to sleep> [//] have a little sleep . 
because if you're going to sleep it's better you sleep now rather than nearer teatime „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
and the thing is , Thomas . 
we needta go into Stockport later . 
<we're going to go to the shop> [//] we're going on the bus into Stockport to the shop . 
a big red bus . 
that's right . 
a po@c bus . 
and when we're inside we can wheel the pushchair straight on . 
and we can look at the steps „ can't we ? 
that lead to the upstairs . 
that's how you know it's a big bus . 
when it (h)as got steps . 
if it hasn't got steps it isn't a big bus „ is it ? 
and we just needta go and buy a present and a card because we've got (.) a Golden_Wedding_Anniversary . 
that's somebody who (h)as been married fifty years . 
on Friday . 
another gentleman who's seventy on Sunday . 
and Peggy's in hospital . 
we've still not sent Peggy a card „ have we ? 
so I think we needta go to Stockport and choose three cards . 
we could walk to xxx . [+ PI] 
but if we go on the bus it gives you a nice ride out „ doesn't it ? 
yes . 
and we needta go and pick some tapes up „ don't we ? 
and then Daddy will come to meet us in Stockport with the car . 
and we can come home in the car „ can't we ? 
instead of on the bus . 
you like riding on the big bus „ don't you ? 
have you had enough of gardening for today ? 
mhm . 
have you just learnt to say mhm ? 
no . 
you must have heard Mummy and Daddy when you're talking to us and we say mhm mhm . 
mhm mhm . 
mhm mhm . 
and you're copying because you're like a parrot . 
Thomas is like a parrot . 
yes . 
oh it's Dipsy „ isn't it ? 
would you like me to reach Dipsy for you ? 
Dipsy [/] Dipsy . 
where is Dipsy ? 
there's Dipsy . 
yes . 
oh are you putting Dipsy to bed ? 
you really must be a tired boy to be going and lying down on your own . 
and while you're having a little lie+down Mummy's going to get a carrier+bag and empty those flowers out of that vase . 
<they can go on> [/] they can go on the compost bin „ can't they ? 
because they've died now . 
they were beautiful lilys „ weren't they ? 
when we got them . 
and look at them now . 
yes . 
po@c football . 
red football . 
have you put it <in the window> [//] on the window ledge . 
where's the blue football ? 
no . 
don't kick things , Thomas . 
there's the yellow football . 
look . 
the yellow football is in the basket there . 
so where do we think the blue football is ? 
where (h)as the blue football gone ? 
I don't know . 
can you see all the petals have started to fall off the flowers ? 
it's a very big vase „ isn't it ? 
watch all the petals . 
they smelt beautiful when they were fresh but the smell's going now „ isn't it ? 
they still smell quite nice „ don't they ? 
there we are . 
they've died . 
I'll hafta put them in there . 
and then we'll take them outside into the compost bin . 
watch you don't knock the flower vase over . 
no . 
let's take them out of the water . 
you can cut the leaves and put them in a carrier+bag . 
that's right . 
we'll take this to the kitchen „ shall we ? 
are you coming with Mummy ? 
be careful . 
you're going to trip . 
it's a very big flower vase „ isn't it ?

let's empty the water down the sink .

off it goes . 
the water (h)as gone now „ hasn't it ?

they're petals not leaves „ aren't they ? 
these are petals . 
they're pink . 
the leaves are green . 
do you see these bits here , Thomas ? 
with the pollen on them . 
that's a leaf . 
that's what the bee was landing on before . 
over the past few days we've been watching the bees in our garden „ haven't we ? 
that's the flower stalk . 
that's a stem . 
the bees have been landing on the flowers . 
I think we've got a lot of bees because we grow lavender „ don't we ? 
does lavender smell nice , Thomas ?

does lavender smell nice ?

the flower petals . 
a lot of the petals have fallen off „ haven't they ? 
and they've gone inside the fireguard .

and unfortunately while we were outside you found a ball „ haven't you ? 
yes . 
have you just chased Purdie with it ? 
it's nice to play with inside , Thomas . 
because it's nice and clean [?] and it's light .

this ? 
well this is one that Mummy brought in while we were outside .

sit on here a minute while Mummy talks to you .

but this is a new one . 
this is something we got this morning when we were walking home .

and we were turning into the road and it was just as if we were walking underneath a beautiful bridge . 
I've never seen such a gorgeous rainbow . 
it was almost as if we could see the ends of each side . 
and it was very bright . 
and you could see each color „ couldn't you ? 
and there was a shadow . 
do you remember the shadow on the rainbow , Thomas ? 
because you said two (rain)bows „ didn't you ? 
there were two [/] two rainbows in the sky . 
it was raining and the sun was out .
