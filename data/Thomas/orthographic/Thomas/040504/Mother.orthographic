the head teacher at Mersey_Vale and Miss xxx .

because they'll have a new set of children „ won't they ? 
just think of nursery where you were last year .

you know the train track that was on the floor . 
all those will now be played with by new children . 
apart from Alice she's still at Mersey_Vale .

it started off in fact last monday „ didn't it ? 
when we went to Picadilly station .

and we went to the shop . 
we did all sorts of things . 
and what had happened to her aeroplane ? 
it still hadn't gone but what [/] what did we find out afterwards [//] had happened to it ? 
a bird hit the plane and knocked the radar out . 
well a radar's the thing that guides the plane in the sky . 
it's the thing that guides it in the sky . 
from Manchester airport all the way to Canada . 
so she couldn't fly and in the end they were taken off the plane . 
and taken to the Holiday_Inn . 
and she spent the night there „ didn't she ? 
(be)cause it was too late to fly . 
and we then got straight +//. [+ IN] 
<time all> [?] we left the airport at two o'clock . 
xxx the train straight to Picaddily . [+ PI]

his tummy's trapped in the doors . 
0 [=! noise] .

I think you'd have a thin tummy if it was trapped in the doors . 
unless it was trapped and it had swollen up . 
perhaps it was swollen with all the bruising from being trapped .

I'll see but I haven't really got enough pennies at the moment , Thomas . 
I hafta buy school uniform and new shoes and things . 
I think the best thing would be if perhaps in a few weeks time we have a trip to the air port and you could choose one you like yourself rather than me buying them . 
(be)cause that would be another trip to the airport . 
we could go on the the train . 
when you grow up to the roof you can buy anything .

a Tesco man he [//] (be)cause a man walking past (.) with a bag he looks like he's been to Tesco it's white and it's got blue stripes and red writing &=laughs it does look like a Tesco carrier „ doesn't it ? 
oh and that night the little boy's no teddy look he's in bed at seven o'clock he's gone to bed early (.) he's crying (.) why's he crying ? 
he wants his teddy and do you think these children are his brothers[>] and sisters ? 
and what are they trying to do ? 
they're trying to make him better „ aren't they but what [//] how are they trying to make him better ? 
that's right[<] . 
it's was like the little girl saying here you are have my soldier and the little boy saying here you are have my pear[?] book it doesn't work „ does it it's not what he wants . 
this is like the P B bear books Thomas but there's a tiny bear in every picture have you noticed ?

he's saying yes I want this one look how many teddies are in this box and the teddy that he wants his teddy has a little tag round its leg and it says number three eight five six two . 
found and it says the date it was found and on which bus (.) so when you think back to that picture there where the little boy's in bed with a tear in his eye .
