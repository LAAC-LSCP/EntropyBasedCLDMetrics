we needta buy some cornflakes today . 
would you like some honey loops or some Rick_Krispies ?

oh you've got to eat something for breakfast what about a cereal bowl . 
cereal bowl ? 
toast ? 
corn [//] well we haven't got any cornflakes , Thomas .

let's have these . 
one of these two . 
just let me check that they are clean as they've been in the cupboard for a long time let me give them a quick rinse . 
would you like this one or this one ? 
that one . 
alright let me just these a rinse . 
these , Thomas , were bowls you got for your christening . 
you know when you go to church and you see babies ? 
at the back of the church near the font ? 
and Marcus usually says this is +//. [+ N] 
what is it ? 
it was Alexander they usually give them a name „ don't they ? 
and then he puts some water in their heads and gives them a candle „ doesn't he ? 
well that's a christening . 
well there's a bit more to it than that . 
but at the moment +/. [+ N] 
that's right on teletubbies they show a christening „ don't they ? 
there's a little boy called Christopher on that one . 
I remember seeing that last summer and then [//] (.) since then they keep showing it . 
it's a little boy „ isn't it ? 
whose being christened and he's with his brother „ isn't he ? 
and I think the baby is called Christopher and he shows him going to church . 
that's right [//] and that's right . 
and the [/] and the vicar holds him in his arms „ doesn't he ? 
and he tips his head over the font and gets this hand with some water from the bowl and puts +/. [+ N] 
look like this . 
puts the sign of the cross on the babies forehead . 
and then he gives him a name „ doesn't he ? 
it's not a name Marcus chooses though the parents choose it . 
because when you were christened Marcus didn't suddenly decide that you would be called Thomas_Henry we decided . 
well I decided you were Thomas and from somewhere Daddy got Henry . 
lord knows where . 
&=laughs . 
so we told Marcus that we wanted you to be called Thomas_Henryand Marcus held you . 
and he said “Thomas_Henry” and then held you really high up . 
so everybody in the church could see and he said “say hello Thomas everybody” and everybody said “hello Thomas” . 
so (.) after your christening we all went and had a very nice meal . 
and there were lots_of presents for you . 
there were these two bowls along with this bowl and that's a heavy bowl and these plates all given to you . 
look the plate says www . 
that's Beatrix_Potter „ isn't it ? 
from Peter and the rabbit . 
and this bowl . 
look . 
that's Peter rabbit eating carrots and what's on top of the spade . 
a robin . 
it says www . 
and these are the bowls we are going to have our cereal in this morning . 
like this says +//. [+ N] 
oh look . 
this is a rabbit [//] this is a lady rabbit „ isn't it ? 
do you think that this is Peter rabbit's Mummy ? 
I think it is „ isn't it ? 
look . 
there she is +//. [+ N] 
when Peter's in the garden there [//] eating lettuces french beans and radishes . 
there he is . 
then he's not very well and is in bed and Mummy rabbit is giving him some medicine or some Camomile tea . 
and here she is out walking in the woods . 
look . 
then www . 
and then you've got a cup up here , Thomas . 
you've got a beaker with Po on .

look . 
there's Mummy rabbit . 
Peter . 
and three [/] three other little rabbits . 
www . 
that's the Mummy „ isn't it ? 
that's right it is a funny story . 
I'm sure we've got the longer story somewhere upstairs . 
there's another rabbit . 
look . 
Mrs_Rabbit . 
that's Peter rabbit who we've seen on the other pictures . 
and these three little bunnys . 
Flopsy . 
Wopsy and +... [+ N] 
+, Cotton_Tail . 
right . 
so we +/. [+ N] 
Cotton [//] Floppy [//] &-um Cotton_Tail . 
oh look at their tails . 
can you see they are all wearing very smart red cloaks „ aren't they ? 
or coats . 
oh look they've got little tails .

you don't hafta hold it but look I'm just showing you that little white tail . 
why throw here away ? 
what's the matter with Molly ? 
oh Thomas . 
we'll just sit her there . 
she'll be really upset now . 
she (h)as got a little cotton tail . 
you know one +/. [+ N] 
well we don't do it anymore but in my bedroom there's some cotton wool „ isn't there ? 
we've got cotton wool in that one [//] either a big roll or we have it in a pleat . 
or Mummy has those round &-um pads that she does her face with but sometimes we buy the little balls of cotton wool . 
and they look like a rabbits tail , don't they ? 
like a cotton tail . 
it looks like someone has got that bunny rabbit and stuck a cotton wool ball on the back „ doesn't it ? 
right . 
I'll pop some juice in this . 
you must be careful with this , Thomas , because if it breaks it smashes . 
and you know at meal times you always have your +//. [+ N] 
well you either have a spoon with some dogs on . 
a hundred and one dalmatians . 
or you have a spoon with Winnie_the_pooh on „ don't you ? 
well they were a present for your Christmas as well . 
you got lots_of nice things . 
there we are . 
keeping that tidy as well . 
did I wash the beaker ? 
I can't remember . 
Flopsy . 
Mopsy and Cotton_Tail . 
Cotton_Tail . 
the battery's flat in the microphone . 
it (h)as gone red . 
I think we must've done something funny with these batterys . 
I think we must have put into the box some batterys . 
there we are . 
working again . 
sorry about that . 
yes . 
sorry whoever's listening to that . 
are you going to say hello@q to everyone ? 
hello . 
Mrs lasagne this is Bella lasagne ? 
no . 
well it's not Dimitra anymore . 
Jeannine . 
Jeannine . 
Elaine . 
Anna . 
Elena . 
Cathy . 
and Lorna . 
will you say hello to them all . 
hello everyone . 
&=laughs . 
are you having a nice day , Thomas . 
right . 
are we going to have some peace [?] . 
do you wanna try one . 
you had one yesterday and really liked it „ didn't you ? 
look . 
that's a good [?] thing to say „ is it ? 
oops . 
xxx . 
it's coming . 
think we'll have sausages for tea tonight , Thomas ? 
what , Thomas . 
what a combination . 
no [/] no you can't have spaghetti Bolognese again . 
we've got sausages in the fridge that need using so we'll have sausages and you can have peas with them and you can either have potato or pasta . 
but I'm not giving you custard with them . 
you can have custard afterwards if you like . 
would you like some bananas in the custard . 
you have had custard . 
no the bowl is for me it's not for you . 
because usually Mummy has milk on cereal . 
but sometimes I like to put juice on and on these I prefer juice to milk . 
so I've made you some juice and just pinched a tiny drop of it to put on my cereal . 
ooh how's that . 
does that taste good ? 
it says www . 
well if we go through the wood up here [//] the part . 
Rabbit . 
Molly . 
Tiddles and sweeties . 
I thought that it would hafta say sweetie somewhere . 
&=laughs . 
well if we go down the monkey path . 
which is not really the wood but there are a lot of trees down either side . 
we end up near the Spar shop „ don't we ? 
and we can buy bread there . 
and if we go through the park which is beautiful „ isn't it ? 
Heaton_Mersey common . 
that's where the ducks are on the pond and the swans . 
we end up at toddler group . 
and within a couple of minutes from toddler group you're in Heaton_Merser village and there's a baker's there „ isn't there ? 
because what do we buy at the baker's ? 
well coming back from toddler group on a Tuesday what do we often buy ? 
you don't call it the baker's you call it the [/] the something something shop . 
no . 
not Michael's . 
Michael's is the butcher's . 
where do we go with Jo and Becky ? 
we've not been for a long time in fairness . 
we useta go with Jo and Becky when you were in your pushchair . 
we useta leave toddle group we'd walk through the village and you and Becky would sit outside in your pushchairs while Jo and I went inside . 
and we'd buy something for lunch (.) and what would we buy ? 
sausages . 
pardon . 
sausage rolls . 
the sausage roll shop that's the baker's . 
but now . 
it's all changed a bit as we go to toddler group and then we hafta dash home . 
have a quick lunch because you are in nursery in the afternoon . 
wanna do it today . 
marathon . 
pushing round . 
but really you don't go anymore in a push chair „ do you ? 
or at least if you go in your pushchair we walk back „ don't we ? 
and we come through the park [//] the common (be)cause it's much quicker . 
to come from toddler group through the park is quicker than going form toddler group to the sausage roll shop . 
right through the village buying things . 
than the other way „ isn't it ? 
we've got some sausage roll shops in Didsbury „ haven't we ? 
baker's . 
what do they sell , Thomas . 
apart from sausage rolls what else can you buy in those shops ? 
no . 
not sausages . 
why are you whispering you're not shy „ are you ? 
whose a naughty child ? 
silly Mummy and who's a naughty child ? 
why am I naughty ? 
0 [=! blows her nose] . 
excuse me . 
am I . 
oh well . 
did you enjoy that ? 
drinking out of you Flopsy Mopsy Cotton_Tail and Peter mug ? 
later I'll go upstairs and see if I can find the book and read the whole story „ shall we ? 
what was that Beatrix_Potter book we had before that you liked ? 
the one that I always got Elaine +//. [+ N] 
Tabitha_Twitchit and I always useta say twit witch but it's Twitchit . 
Tabitha_Twitchit do you remember with her pussy cats ? 
one was called Ginger „ wasn't he ? 
listen I'm thinking about it . 
we've got that plate for Purdie „ haven't we ? 
it's actually in the washing up bowl so I'll hafta get it out carefully . 
do you remember . 
www . 
do you remember that ? 
<the Mummy pussy cat> [>] ? 
well you'll hafta look , Thomas , because it's dirty . 
she sent them out to play whilst she made some [//] I think it was hot buttered toast „ wasn't it ? 
and then what did they do when they got outside ? 
they got in a mess „ didn't they ? 
do you remember ? 
oh she wasn't a happy Mummy pussy cat „ was she ? 
well she sent them up to bed . 
she told them off . 
she said “you naughty kittens” . 
and she sent them up to bed and I think when her friends came to visit . 
instead of being honest with them and saying “ooh the kittens got really dirty and I was cross with them and I sent them to bed” . 
she said “I'm very sorry but the kittens have got measles and are tucked up in bed” . 
they weren't at all „ were they ? 
they were having pillow fights and doing all sorts of naughty things . 
jumping on the [/] on the bed . 
no . 
it's hot that , Thomas . 
oh it's not too hot . 
there you are . 
again what do you say . 
you don't say “I want” . 
what do you say . 
no . 
you don't . 
please may I have . 
what would Mrs_Plattford say to you if she heard you saying “I want” ? 
hm: . 
I can imagine . 
I don't think she'd be very happy . 
Mrs_Plattford „ do you ? 
not a happy Mrs_Plattford . 
no . 
does she get cross sometimes ? 
with you all or with everybody ? 
she's a very brave lady looking after so many little children . 
yes Zoe as well though . 
Zoe's very clever looking after little children „ isn't she ? 
mm I enjoyed that . 
have you enjoyed yours ? 
Thomas_Henry have you enjoyed yours ? 
you not talking ? 
what's that matter ? 
Thomas just because you've closed your eyes I can still see you . 
you can't see me . 
it's no good putting your hands over your face (be)cause I can still see you . 
you can't keep quiet for five minutes anyway . 
you giggler „ can you ? 
be careful [/] be careful . 
mind that cup . 
right . 
I shall put some toast in the toaster .

stop saying yuck@q . 
now I shall go upstairs . 
oh look whose piece of bread . 
magic [?] it's a funny piece of bread „ isn't it ? 
a big hole in the middle „ isn't it ? 
try to put your jam on that it will fall straight through . 
pardon . 
Humpty_Dumpty ? 
I don't think we've got a Humpty_Dumpty story it's a nursery rhyme „ isn't it ? 
or have they done it on Tweenies as a story ? 
Humpty_Dumpty sat on a wall . [+ R] 
Humpty_Dumpty had a great +... [+ N] [+ IN] 
all the king's horses and all the king's <men couldn't> [>] put Humpty together again . [+ R] 
clipity_clop@o that's right . 
are you ? 
you make a nice horse , Thomas . 
mm cup of tea's good . 
excuse me . 
are you ? 
you are a big horse . 
you are a nice horse „ aren't you ? 
come on horse . 
don't think I've ever sat at the breakfast table with a horse before . 
oh yes . 
do you ? 
you pretending I'm a horse ? 
well [>] you're the horse . 
right . 
what have I got in my hands ? 
some grass ? 
that's right I'll keep my hands straight . 
tell you what I'll put some honey nut loops in my hand because horses like things like that . 
oh . 
how's that ? 
Daddy's cousin has a riding stable „ doesn't she ? 
alright I'll put some honey nut loops flat in my hand and you can pretend you're a horse eating them from the palm of my hand . 
that's a good way to get you to eat . 
there you go horse . 
do you remember to go [//] going to see Janice and Phil and the twins ? 
where all the horses are stabled . 
the horse wants some toast . 
well the horse's mother . 
is just looking for a plate . 
no . 
what (h)as he done . 
he saw another thing . 
oh you want the other plate as well ? 
you can have another plate „ can't you ? 
what does the horse want on his toast some marmalade or some jam ? 
cricket on his own ? 
swinging and sleeping . 
no . 
this is jam . 
we always have [/] always have this on our toast . 
pardon . 
well it [/] well it is . 
this margarine is flora and that is a red heart shape because it's trying to tell you it's good for your heart . 
but that's right . 
they've put a little string on it . 
it's a kite . 
it's like a balloon „ isn't it ? 
ooh . 
very nice . 
are there ? 
lots_of dandelions in the horses back garden ? 
would you like some more honey loops or have you had enough ? 
Thomas , talk to me please . 
you can't eat the spoon you silly_billy@wp get it out of your mouth . 
right . 
there we are . 
we're going to read Thomas's plate . 
www . [+ R] 
how's that ? 
shall I slice some more bread to make some more toast ? 
mm . 
you've got jam on it . 
I don't think I can talk at all because the toast is so crunchy . 
I'm just trying to remember the other Jamima_Puddleduck [/] [/] Jamima [//] Beatrix_Potter story . 
it was Jamima_Puddleduck „ wasn't it ? 
well it's the same toast . 
there you are . 
whose a good boy . 
thank you . 
you getting all sticky ? 
just looking at all the flowers in the garden . 
we've got a lot out at the moment „ haven't we ? 
raining . 
I don't think it's raining at the moment „ is it ? 
I'm looking at the drinking bowl we've got outside for Purdie . 
it doesn't look like any rain water's dropping in that „ does it ? 
I'll put that funny shaped piece of bread in the toaster now . 
the one with the big hole in the middle . 
oh I'm sorry . 
pardon . 
you're smelling jam ? 
a whole jar ? 
mm what sort of jam is that ? 
strawberry jam . 
it smells nice „ doesn't it ? 
Thomas , stop saying “I want” . 
no one is going to like a little boy that says <I want I want> [/] I want „ are they ? 
that's better . 
please may I have sounds even better than that . 
you want more honey nut loops . 
you only want [//] because you're eating it like a horse out of the palm of my hands . 
but still if it gets you to eat . 
I don't mind . 
what do you say ? 
say it as if you mean it ! 
don't sound resentful . 
and horses usually have big teeth . 
I hope you didn't bit me when you were doing that . 
oops a daisy . 
now look what (h)as happened . 
0 [=! laughs ] . 
oh quick Fireman_Sam . 
toaster's on fire . 
right . 
drama over . 
drama [>] . 
drama over . 
right . 
it's the bit with the hole that's burnt not the bit at the edge . 
we'll put this outside or in the bin . 
just leave that there to cool off . 
didn't really set on fire just saw some smoke coming up . 
right . 
would you like some more jam on that ? 
Thomas , what do you say ? 
just watch yourself on that jam there . 
it feels very funny when you're eating out of my hand . 
Teletubbies do something with a horse „ don't they ? 
I haven't really watched that one but I remember seeing a lady with a saddle . 
perhaps going to ride a horse . 
my niece Helen rides horses a lot . 
she (h)as won lots_of medals . 
trophys . 
rosettes I think they're called . 
and Daddy's cousin has lots and lots and lots_of horses living on her farm „ doesn't she ? 
mm . 
she rides horses a lot in shows „ doesn't she ? 
a donkey . 
a donkey ? 
do you ? 
I think we've got enough with Purdie actually „ don't you ? 
oh I don't think Purdie has ever seen a donkey , Thomas . 
but no . 
I couldn't imagine Purdie would really like a donkey in the garden . 
do you ? 
you want it to eat your grass up ? 
oh yes . 
that would be quite useful and then we wouldn't hafta cut the grass „ would we ? 
we could do with some sheep or some donkeys and some cows . 
moo@o . 
are you ? 
mm . 
right . 
would you like some more jam on this toast ? 
excuse me Mr cow . 
look , Thomas . 
I'm not responding to that . 
Purdie doesn't say moo@q „ does she ? 
what does Purdie say ? 
she does not . 
little fluff_fluff^fluffer@c . 
mm she (h)as got quite a lot of fluff on the floor this morning . 
Purdie's hair doesn't come out as individual hairs „ does it ? 
when it comes out it comes out as big chunks [/] big chunks of fluff . 
talking of donkeys . 
do you remember at Christmas you got a little present from Father Christmas when he came to toddler group ? 
when we got it home it was a little book about a lost donkey „ wasn't it ? 
it's upstairs . 
oh we'll find it later . 
when we go to the seaside . 
they sometimes have rides on donkeys on the beach . 
places like Blackpool and Scarborough and Bridlington . 
you pay some money and you are allowed to sit on the donkey and it walks up and down the beach . 
&=laughs . 
hopefully not but yes I suppose it's possible . 
you'd fall off the donkey and into the sea . 
and the crocodiles will eat you . 
oh goodness me I don't think they'll bother having a donkey ride then . 
I think that you're quite safe usually on a donkey (be)cause you're not allowed to go on your own . 
there's usually somebody with you walking along and I don't think they would let you go beside the sea because I don't think the donkeys would like the sea „ do you ? 
did he ? 
at Auntie_Charlotte's Ben went underneath Charlotte ? 
hm: . 
is that what you said or is that what Ben's Daddy said ? 
they play very well together Ben and Charlotte „ don't they ? 
brother and sister they play very nicely . 
oh they fight as well [//] sometimes they fight . 
well that's just what happens . 
well no . 
people don't like fighting . 
and it's not really fair because Ben's a lot bigger than Charlotte . 
Charlotte's only a little girl . 
and Ben [/] Ben's bigger than you . 
it's not really nice when Ben hits Charlotte but I think she's quite tough „ isn't she ? 
they're your little friends „ aren't they . 
you like Ben and Charlotte „ don't you ? 
you wanna play with your garage ? 
it's not your garage „ is it ? 
whose garage „ is it ? 
it's got to go back today , Thomas . 
we only borrowed it really over night „ didn't we ? 
no you can do when you finish your breakfast we'll go and have a play with it . 
have you ? 
you just suddenly finished it because you've seen the garage . 
the garage is by the door because it's on it's way back to Ben's . 
but Ben's at nursery this morning . 
no .
