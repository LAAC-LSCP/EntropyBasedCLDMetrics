not sure whether (.) that will work it properly . 
<oh that's> [>] why . 
the battery's run out , Thomas . 
<xxx „ is it> [<] ? [+ PI] 
++ your play area ? 
yes . 
well it's not yours . 
it is at the moment . 
when you've got your toys in it . 
yes . 
right . 
could I just have a little word with you now , Thomas [>] ? 
it's alright xxx still working yeah . [+ PI] 
yes . 
all I wanna say is +... [+ IN] 
+, I know you've been a bit excited today ? 
but when you get excited and you get silly +... [+ IN] 
+, you get naughty as well sometimes , Thomas . 
no . 
stop playing with that . 
and just listen to what I'm telling you <for a minute> [>] . 
concentrate on one thing at a time . 
Mummy's very cross . 
when you had that lift with Aunty_Debbie . 
because you wouldn't sit back in your chair . 
you were pulling onto the headrest . 
Uncle_Sid was driving . 
and it's quite dangerous doing that . 
he was concentrating on the road . 
if the car had stopped suddenly you would have bumped your face . 
you should have been sitting right back . 
not messing with the headrest . 
you wouldn't do that in Daddy's car . 
because Daddy would get ever so cross with you . 
when you're in somebody else's car you should behave even better than you do in your own . 
show them what a good boy you are . 
well I think they must have thought when you got off the car +"/. [+ IN] 
+" thank goodness for that . 
+" I'm glad he's gone . 
+" he wasn't well behaved . 
+" I won't offer him a lift again . 
so I wasn't happy . 
pardon ? 
Connie wouldn't say what ? 
no . 
(be)cause they like you very much . 
but what I'm meaning is +/. [+ IN] 
you know . 
+, that was dangerous as well as naughty „ Thomas . 
just think . 
when I ask you please not to do something will you kindly not do it ? 
don't wait until I hafta say it <over and over and> [/] over and over again . 
until in the end I shout and really lose my temper . 
it's like when we went into the park and I said +"/. [+ IN] 
+" please do not +//. [+ IN] 
you [//] I saw you throwing a stick into a puddle . 
and I said “please do not do that” . 
and what did you do ? 
you went straight over and got another [/] another stick . 
and threw it in . 
you just ignored xxx . [+ PI] 
just then I asked you to calm down . 
Daddy's through there . 
I wanted peace and quiet . 
you haring around +... [+ IN] 
+, will make Daddy cross . 
anyway that's all I'm going to say . 
but please will you just think . 
and especially +/. [+ IN] 
you know what [//] when we're out I don't like to get cross with you in front of people . 
but if that's what you're going to do +... [+ IN] 
if you're just going to rely on the fact that I don't get cross in front of people +... [+ IN] 
+, and do very naughty things +... [+ IN] 
+, then I shall get extremely cross in front of people . 
and then you'd be embarrassed „ won't you ? 
you're not a naughty boy „ Thomas . 
most of the time you're a very [/] very good boy . 
you will play now . 
I've said my piece . 
please stop [?] okay ? 
okay ? 
<that's the> [<] xxx . [+ PI] 
yeah . 
oh right , Thomas , xxx we've got aeroplanes here . [+ PI] 
and xxx <other planes> [?] here . 
what's this ? 
it's the staff room ? 
and it's pictures of planes rather than real planes „ is it ? 
I see . 
it could be a model of air [//] airplanes in the staff room „ couldn't it ? 
there you are painted your plane xxx . [+ PI] 
well you know what else they could be , Thomas ? 
they could actually be outside . 
pretend there's a [//] an absolutely enormous car park or plane port [//] heliport or whatever they're called . 
<and when> [<] you've made all the sweets in your factory [>] +... [+ IN] 
we could load them into boxes and the aeroplanes could ship them round the world for you . 
so perhaps when we're in the <staff room> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
when we're in the staff room having a nice cup of tea we can look out of the window and see all the planes . 
<when xxx > [>] [?] . [+ PI] 
<what's this> [?] ?

xxx here the bucket that's in here . [+ I]

ahhah . 
no it is a problem (be)cause we haven't got a lid for that . 
uhoh . 
oh do you really need a lid on ? 
oh we'll pretend we have a lid . 
I can't think of anything we've got small enough to fit in the back of your truck with the lid on „ can you ? 
the other small one ? 
sorry I put it back in your bag . 
did I ? 
where's [<] the lid ?

they won't fit in the truck , Thomas . 
xxx [>] . 
okay one is +/. 
one is a turtle . 
and one is a frog . 
okay . 
those are plastic mammals „ aren't they ? 
possibly make jelly in those . 
they'd be good jelly moulds „ wouldn't they ? 
are you nearly ready ? 
this sheep you've given me , Thomas , is it off one of your fire engines ? 
is it a tortoise ? 
I wasn't quite sure what it was . 
I said turtle . 
but you're probably right . 
what color is it ?

in the cab at the front . 
<in the front> [<] .

and where are you driving to now ?

+, if that's what [//] the sort of gingerbread you were making . 
and do you know when we buy gingerbread men from the same shop they have Smarties for eyes „ don't they ?

are they nice ? 
and I usually have three buttons down the front . 
three buttons three sultanas down the front of the gingerbread man's body . 
to make it look like buttons on a shirt . 
oh I'm sure we could but &-um I've just never done it before .

so do you remember the boy that she put in the cage ? 
she was trying to fatten him up to eat him „ wasn't she ?

he useta (.) push it through the bars every morning when she useta come along and say +"/.

he useta pop this bone through „ didn't he ? 
for her to feel that . 
and then one day she said to Grettal +"/.

well she [//] (.) Grettal shut the oven door . 
tightly shut like you've just done there .

well I don't very often eat these . 
so I'll put them there <in a container> [?] .

I went up to the spare room last night . 
what was that round ball on the floor ?

that's an Aniseed ball that's been sucked .

now who would have done that ? 
you're cheeky . 
did you not like it ? 
no . 
<what did what> [//] did you pinch it ?

suck it a bit ?

I don't like this . 
so what did you do ? 
you ran upstairs ? 
and hid it in the spare room ? 
you must have had it in your mouth a while for the color to come off . 
I'm not cross . 
I thought it was quite funny .

no . 
seriously I tell you why not . 
because you didn't know what it was . 
they could have been tablets „ couldn't they ? 
no . 
listen , Thomas . 
seriously you [/] you don't go in cupboards and take pots that you don't know what they are .

what if when you were run [//] running upstairs +//. [+ IN] 
don't look at me with those big eyes .

that's not long ago . 
after we'd had our lunch and we were walking around the main street remember we saw that beautiful sweet shop ? 
I think I bought a sugar mouse „ didn't I ? 
and what about and [/] what you and Daddy bought . 
but we each got some sweets . 
oh the shop was full of things . 
do you remember that beautiful sweet shop ? 
sorry <did you> [/] did you get what , darling ? 
a big Coca_Cola bottle ? 
I can't remember what you got . 
Daddy bought I can't remember what . 
but it was a beautiful shop . 
every sort of sweet imaginable . 
and in fact when we go to York and we walk down one of the streets <there's a nice> [>] sweet shop there . 
but they're very fancy expensive chocolates . 
but it's more [/] more chocolates and fudge . 
I like fudge . 
it is . 
hello . 
oh Mr_Delivery_Man , you really are a clever Delivery man . 
you've managed to get all these sweets to a right +//. [+ IN] 
I think I'll open the shop now . 
hurry there's a new bucket there yes . 
no I don't think you will . 
but I think we needta pick all the bits off the floor „ don't we ? 
that's right yes . 
that's a good way of gathering them up . 
shall I help ? 
do you not want me to help ? 
well shall I perhaps push the ones that are nearly on the floor towards you ? 
there we are . 
very good . 
they're annoying little bits of marshmallows these . 
<are you> [<] ? 
I wonder why you think those balls look like big marshmallows . 
do you mean marshmallows or do you mean meringues ? 
marshmallows ? 
do you like marshmallows ? 
hello . 
when Mummy useta go camping we useta get wooden skewers . 
and thread +... [+ IN] 
+, marshmallows onto them . 
you know pink and white ones ? 
and then for some reason . 
I don't quite know why . 
we useta put them in the campfire . 
and they all &w [/] went urgh@o melty and gooey and gorgeous actually . 
don't think I'd like them now though . 
but (.) as a child I thought they were very nice . 
and a treat which I never have now because <I don't actually> [//] I've gone off hot chocolate +... [+ IN] 
sometimes as a special treat <for hot> [/] with hot chocolate +... [+ IN] 
+, we would put Cadbury's +//. [+ IN]

no . 
oh [<] don't slip on the floor . 
something's (.) gone right across the floor . 
and left a big red mark . 
what do you think that is ? 
it must have something to do with the truck I think . 
because the truck was red . 
what's the green ? 
there's a little bit of grass <under there> [?] . 
xxx . 
when I was downstairs setting the tape recorder I could hear you going splish^splash@o in the bath .

mm . 
I just don't want it too many splashes , Thomas [>] . 
<don't please> [>] .

because we've hadta come upstairs because it's ever so late . 
and we've hadta continue with bath time „ <haven't we> [>] ? 
but [<] we're still playing with the sweet shop . 
but listen . 
Jeannine might wanna listen to this through the microphone . 
and she won't hear if there's lots_of splashing . 
so just try and keep the splashing down . 
okay ?

you've always liked this game „ haven't you in the bath ? 
where you're pretending to make sweets .

I see . 
you're playing with the bath sponge „ aren't you ? 
and pretending it's a sweet . 
some sort of sweet mixture . 
from being very [/] [<] very young , Thomas when we useta go to Didsbury park and you would climb up the steps of the slide +... [+ IN]

serving things to people .

my friends don't wanna know about things like that .

even older than I am now , darling . 
is that your old man voice ? 
I wonder what you'd be like when you're an old man , Thomas . 
I won't be around probably when you're an old man . 
unless I live to be about two hundred . 
I know it is quite a funny thought „ isn't it ? 
&=laughs . 
ooh I remember when I was a hundred .

oh Thomas , I hope you live to be older than fifty . 
if you died at fifty that would be tragic . 
but at least if you did you wouldn't hafta listen to Mummy . 
going on about when you were a little boy . 
when you're fifty if Mummy's still alive I'll be (.) nearly ninety . 
I know ! 
I'll be 0a doddering old lady „ won't I ? 
oh Thomas , listen to this . 
if I live to be a hundred [>] +... [+ IN]

then it'll be just like now . 
neither of us will hafta do anything . 
you won't hafta go to nursery or school . 
Mummy won't hafta go to work . 
<instead of going> [>] to toddler groups we can go to OAP parties . 
old age pensioner parties . 
things at the community centre . 
&=laughs . 
<and instead> [/] and instead of me pushing you [/] <you round> [>] in your pushchair you can push me in a wheelchair . 
or probably bath chair by then . 
&=laughs . 
oh thank you for your support . 
&=laughs . 
<and I'll> [>] [/] I'll probably have a cup with a lid on so I don't spill it .

and I would say +"/. [+ IN] 
Thomas , you'll hafta help me cross the road . 
oh that would be excellent . 
<we could go> [/] we could go to the train station .

what <so you fancy> [?] spending an afternoon with me as an old lady at the train station too much ?

what's the whistle for ? 
what sort of whistle is that ?

alright then . 
oh that cake's wonderful . 
I'd forgotten all about cakes and things . 
I was too busy being elderly . 
you've got a real wicked smile on your face , Thomas . 
we'd hafta set off even earlier than we do now . 
because [>] +/. [+ IN] 
<because when> [<] [/] when we useta walk to the station we useta hafta set off ever such a long time ahead . 
because you couldn't walk very fast . 
but now you can walk quicker than me . 
but in a good few years time I won't be able to walk half as quick as I do now . 
so we'll hafta set off ever so early so I can get there on time . 
do you know what ? 
yes . 
that's right . 
yes <you'll be> [/] you'll be desperate to get out . 
and I'll be faffing around with my breakfast like you are at the moment .

this is it . 
now this is sound advice from somebody old . 
you're better to bake your cake before you put the icing on .

it will melt . 
all the icing will go splat@o .
