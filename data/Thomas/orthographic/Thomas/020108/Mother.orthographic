Thomas , just have a look at this red digger outside . 
it's a red lorry . 
it (h)as just pulled up outside . 
it's a red lorry but it (h)as got a digger on the back „ hasn't it ? 
beep beep . 
that's a big truck „ isn't it . 
oh it's a bit dirty „ isn't it ? 
it (h)as got dirty wheels . 
yes . 
there's the little red car trying to get past the big lorry . 
yes . 
it's the digger on the back „ isn't it ? 
it's the big digger . 
well I think it (h)as got one wheel on the pavement and one wheel on the road so it's half up and half down „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
that's right . 
that's Tiddles the cat from next door . 
she's having a look at the truck now . 
she better stay away from it or it might hurt her . 
beep beep . 
yes . 
the wheels are a little bit dirty . 
oh look at Tiddles . 
she's running very fast across the road . 
she's going home . 
oh now what's coming ? 
a big green Land_Rover . 
steps . 
are you saying steps because the truck is parked half on the pavement and half on the road ? 
and it's half up and half down . 
are you wanting the truck to come down onto the road ? 
yes . 
the driver (h)as got in the cab now . 
and he's driving backwards . 
oh I see . 
he's just pulling his truck in a little bit further because he's blocking the road and the cars can't get past „ can't they ? 
no . 
he's not going anywhere . 
he's getting out of his lorry and he's closing the door . 
oh it's quite dirty „ isn't it ? 
did you see that lady throwing some sticks onto the back of the lorry ? 
yes . 
she should +... [+ IN] 
well . 
this is quite true . 
we've been telling you off for throwing things . 
and she's throwing things . 
but the difference is she (h)as just moved house and she (h)as got quite a lot of rubbish she wants to clear . 
and so the builders come with these lorrys so that she can throw things into the back of the lorry and he can take them to the skip . 
so when she's throwing things into the back of the lorry that's alright . 
she's putting them in on purpose . 
but you sometimes pick things up and just throw them „ don't you ? 
isn't it funny watching things going up in the air and landing in the truck ? 
oh it's quite dirty . 
quite a dirty truck . 
your eyes look tired . 
did you have a nice time this morning at the playgroup ? 
whoops . 
two cars are coming together and they can't get past „ can they ?

oh look . 
the lady and man are coming back with some more things to throw on the skip .

Mummy's just going to open the door so Purdie can go out if she wants to . 
is that what the truck says ? 
oh . 
that was a big noise „ wasn't it ? 
bash . 
there was bash „ wasn't there ? 
they threw something quite heavy into the back of the truck . 
shoo shoo . 
that's Tiddles the pussy+cat from next door . 
what are you saying to her ? 
shoo shoo . 
because Purdie wouldn't like it if she saw Tiddles „ would she ? 
in her garden . 
Tiddles has a red collar . 
she's wearing a collar round her neck with a little bell . 
and the collar is red . 
do you think Tiddles is going to run away in a moment ? 
no .
