no chocolates . 
no . 
do you know why ? 
Mummy's clearing out the cupboard „ isn't she ? 
I've not actually done it yet but I'm going to . 
I've just moved things from the top . 
ah is that the little racing car driver from the racing car that you're playing with ? 
he can't sit properly on his engine thing . 
that's so his hands move . 
his hands move up and down . 
is he sitting in it properly ? 
the wheel's a bit scary . 
oh squeaky . 
squeaky . 
let's have a little look at it . 
well you play with these trains a lot when you're eating meals at the table so perhaps something has got stuck in it although I did wash it . 
it's that one , Thomas „ isn't it ? 
it looks perfectly clean now . 
look . 
perfectly clean . 
look . 
there we are . 
they're not squeaking . 
perhaps it was a different one . 
shall we put that one back on ? 
I'm sorry . 
you do it . 
yes . 
sitting on it properly . 
do you not want the engine driver and the rest of the train ? 
are you sure ? 
no . 
look . 
he's the racing car driver . 
this is the train driver . 
okay . 
fair enough . 
it was just when he was sitting in the racing car I thought it was a racing car driver . 
is it the train driver on his day off ? 
oh I see . 
he has a racing car „ does he ? 
yes . 
on his day off he's going for a ride in his racing car followed by a trailer a carriage and a train . 
that's very strange „ isn't it ? 
he's not pulling passengers though „ is he ? 
toy passengers . 
what do you mean by toy passengers ? 
toy passengers . 
Thomas , would you like Rice_Krispies or cornflakes , darling ? 
would you like milk ? 
no . 
no [/] no . 
Thomas , would you like milk ? 
no . 
no thank you . 
where are your manners ? 
I think they are over there because they're not here „ are they ? 
your manners . 
they're in my pyjamas „ are they ? 
oh right . 
well I'll tell you what . 
shall I get them out of my pocket and start using them ? 
your nails . 
oh Grandad (h)as always said you've got very good manners because you're so polite . 
but it's not polite just to say yes „ is it ? 
or no . 
it's yes please or no thank you . 
are you ? 
there is . 
lots_of carriages on it . 
pulling them . 
you're making a noise now . 
xxx , Thomas . [+ PI] 
no +//. [+ IN] 
oh don't make a noise . 
no [/] no [/] no . 
shall we just put them to one side while we have our breakfast ? 
go on let them drive over there . 
you can still look at them . 
yes . 
look . 
why doesn't the horse join you for breakfast ? 
there you are . 
that's right . 
you give the horse some breakfast and I'll just move these trays onto the floor . 
because they're making a lot of noise . 
it's a bit early in the morning and Mummy's a bit delicate , Thomas . 
first thing in the morning „ isn't she ? 
the horse said it's delicious and could he have some more . 
well I would imagine he could „ couldn't he ? 
are you going to have some more ? 
is that what the horse is saying ? 
it's lovely . 
is it lovely ? 
there we are . 
we'll pour some milk on there . 
like a horse does . 
the horse wants to go tap [/] tap [/] tap . 
but did you say before the horse wants to go to Stockport ? 
oh right . 
has the horse fallen down with the wind ? 
it (h)as blown him over . 
oh dear dear . 
poor horse . 
it has been very windy recently „ hasn't it ? 
do you remember when we went for the walk on Sunday ? 
we went for a long walk up the hill „ didn't we ? 
and as we were coming home we could just feel the odd raindrop . 
it was just so gentle . 
it was quite nice . 
and we got in the house . 
and within a few minutes on getting in the house what happened ? 
ah there were hailstones and wind . 
and we were really lucky to get back in time „ weren't we ? 
do you remember going , Thomas ? 
to the pond on Sunday . 
we met Lisa „ didn't we ? 
pardon . 
oh it was on the way to playgroup . 
yes . 
that's right . 
that's the [/] the route we take „ isn't it ? 
when we go to playgroup we go near Jo's house and near Lynne Ben and Charlotte's house . 
and we walk up the hill . 
it's a long way „ isn't it ? 
right up the hill . 
when we're at the top of the hill what does Mummy say ? 
what does she show you ? 
I show you Owens_Park_Tower „ don't I ? 
and I say that's near where Mummy +/. [+ IN] 
well no . 
I don't say I live down there . 
I say that's near where Mummy works . 
yes . 
it's water from the water filter . 
I'm pouring it into your beaker . 
I no like water . 
no . 
but you always have drinks with water in , Thomas . 
whether it's orange or blackcurrant juice . 
we get a little bit of blackcurrant juice from the bottle and we hafta top it up with water from the filter . 
taste that . 
I think you'll find it tastes just like it always does . 
and when Mummy has tea and coffee it's always made with water . 
I put a tea bag in the tea pot . 
or a spoonful of coffee in the coffee cup . 
and we always pour on water . 
it comes from the kettle . 
we either get water from the tap and put it into the water filter for cold drinks . 
or we get water from the tap and put it in the kettle . 
and boil it up for hot drinks . 
and then we put water straight from the tap into Purdie's bowl and she drinks it „ doesn't she ? 
from the floor . 
and when it rains outside and we get some puddles on the ground the birds come and they drink from that . 
and occasionally we see Purdie and ginger cat drinking <from water outside> [//] from the puddles outside . 
I think sometimes pussy cats like water that's outside better than the water that Mummy puts down . 
Purdie . 
who likes breakfast ? 
Crispa@c . 
what do you mean Crispa@c ? 
no . 
I don't know . 
I haven't a clue . 
what are you talking about ? 
mm they taste nice . 
well this unit is going out on Friday „ isn't it ? 
Friday morning . 
we've got a very busy week . 
yes . 
we've got to empty everything out . 
so I've taken everything off the top . 
the only things that are up there are what ? 
Dimitra's coming . 
yes . 
the two microphones with green lights on . 
no . 
Dimitra's not coming today . 
but the microphones are there because we're doing a tape . 
oh no . [+ I] 
well we do +... [+ IN] 
yes . 
it is dustbin man day . 
we [/] we usually rush home „ don't we ? 
0 [=! coughs] . 
on dustbin men day we seem to be out „ don't we ? 
and as we arrive home we usually just seem them coming . 
and we put tape in and manage to catch a little bit of it . 
but we didn't actually „ did we ? 
you managed to see the dustbin men „ didn't you ? 
we didn't manage to get it on tape . 
because what happened ? 
Jo and Becky came round for lunch „ didn't they ? 
and then we walked back to Jo's house . 
to get Sooty . 
to take Sooty for a walk . 
and then when we got to the park +... [+ IN] 
in the muddy bit of the park where it's not nice to walk Jo took Becky and her pushchair and the dog for a walk . 
and we walked down the monkey path „ didn't we ? 
down the monkey path and onto Burnish_Lane . 
and while we were on the monkey path we could hear that the dustbin lorry was on it's way . 
and we walked back up Shevington_Drive . 
and all the way home . 
and we met the man putting the bin bags out „ didn't we ? 
and we managed to get inside the house take our shoes and coats off and then that was it . 
they were at the window „ weren't they ? 
oh look . 
Molly's on the fence . 
can you see her ? 
so <you did see> [/] you did see them this week but we didn't manage to catch it on tape I'm afraid . 
can you see Molly ? 
yes . 
I'm eating my cornflakes . 
Molly (h)as got a big yellow disc on her collar . 
look at that . 
you wanna eat my cornflakes . 
you cheeky monkey . 
when I asked you want you wanted you said Krispies . 
just let me have another mouthful because I'm really enjoying them . 
mm . 
oh bless you , darling . 
you've still got your cold „ haven't you ? 
oh poor , Tom . 
you've just nearly coughed +/. [+ IN] 
oh do you mean your Rice_Krispies nearly came out ? 
look . 
there's Molly . 
she's jumping down the fence . 
yes . 
oh she's got a red collar on with a yellow disk . 
that's unusual . 
is she ? 
she's walking about „ isn't she ? 
we'll probably see a lot more of the pussy cats now , Thomas . 
because the weather's getting nicer „ isn't it ? 
it's getting a bit lighter . 
while you're having your Rice_Krispies I'm going to put some milk on them . 
is that alright ? 
so if you want them back now you'll find they've got milk . 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
oh dear . 
excuse me . 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
excuse me please . 
oh we're both suffering „ aren't we ? 
and Daddy (h)as got a cold . 
pardon . 
yes . 
last night you did jump on the settee . 
what did Daddy do ? 
well +/. [+ IN] 
is that what he said ? 
Thomas , that's naughty and smacked your bottom . 
well the thing is , Thomas . 
how many times has Mummy told you about jumping on the sofa ? 
it's alright doing little jumps but you do great big jumps . 
and you're going to fall off one day . 
and you're going to really hurt yourself . 
and apart from falling off the settee if you go forwards you'll smash your head on the wooden bannister and it'll really hurt . 
who's hiding under the settee ? 
no . 
I don't think you can get underneath the settee . 
you can go behind it but you can't go underneath . 
it's too low down . 
it's perfect for losing Lego bricks and things like that underneath it . 
it's too small for you . 
but the other thing , Thomas . 
Mummy cleans up everyday . 
and I straighten the cushions and get it all looking nice . 
and if you're jumping on it especially with shoes it's not nice „ is it ? 
people hafta sit down on that . 
so Mummy kept telling you not to jump on the sofa . 
Daddy kept telling you not to do it and you carried on doing it . 
so Daddy got very [/] very cross „ didn't he ? 
so you better not do it again . 
because if he (h)as warned you and you keep doing it then I don't know what he's going to do to you . 
what do you think he'll do ? 
he might say no more chocolate ever [/] ever again . 
and then you'd be upset „ wouldn't you ? 
yes . 
you would . 
that's exactly what you'd say . 
it always happens , Thomas . 
you [/] you do things . 
you're asked not to do things and then you do it . 
and then something happens . 
and then we explain that's why we told you in the first place not to do it . 
it's only because I love you . 
it's like the settee . 
if you you're jumping on the settee and you fall off and hurt yourself that upsets Mummy as well as you . 
I don't like to see you getting hurt . 
it's all part of <growing up> [>] . 
&-um . 
look . 
a ladder . 
yes . 
you see the same thing if you climb up ladders . 
they fall over and say bang „ don't they ? 
and then you get hurt . 
it's all part of growing up , darling . 
you'll do lots_of things . 
oh Grandad has +... [+ IN] 
one of Grandad's teeth fell out „ didn't it ? 
pardon . 
was he sick ? 
oh dear . 
oh well +/. [+ IN] 
oh when [/] when you're sick it's usually like strawberries because you normally have Calpol . 
and it comes back „ doesn't it ? 
all pink . 
no . 
Grandad wasn't sick , Thomas . 
but his tooth . 
it's been loose for years and years . 
finally fell out „ didn't it ? 
is that where it (h)as gone in the bin ? 
in the blue bin at Nana's . 
I was just saying before , my darling . 
all part of growing up is lots and lots_of things will happen to you . 
little knocks and big knocks . 
it's all part of growing up , sweetheart . 
but sometimes when I've warned you about things just listen . 
it's like running away „ isn't it ? 
when [<] we're outside . 
why did Mummy say not to run away ? 
well what about the cars ? 
who's that ? 
I think they've got the wrong house . 
it's the red car with ladders on top . 
but it's [//] they've come to the wrong house . 
haven't they ? 
well it's a red can with ladders on top . 
it looks like decorators but they should be parked at Fred and Rachel's house . 
it (h)as got something to do with them „ hasn't it ? 
not us . 
yes . 
well they'll hafta move „ won't they ? 
soon . 
I think what it is . 
Fred and Rachel have both got their cars on the drive and the men must not realize that it's [/] it's ours . 
it doesn't really matter anyway because we're not using the drive „ are we ? 
oh I hope they haven't got cars on fire , Thomas . 
they've had a fire in the house „ haven't they ? 
yes . 
the ceiling got cracked in their bedroom „ didn't it ? 
and in the bathroom . 
the loft space caught fire . 
there was a lot of smoke up there . 
and all the tiles in the bathroom cracked . 
and the bedroom +/. [+ IN] 
&-um . 
and the ceiling cracked . 
&-um . 
oh did they really . 
is that what happened ? 
&-um . 
oh I don't know about that being very loud . 
you're very loud . 
well I think it's decorators . 
they look like they're getting out dust sheets „ don't they ? 
from the car . 
well I was peeping through the blinds . 
I was giving him a hard stare , Thomas . 
hoping he'd get the message . 
they didn't look up though . 
they're just shaking lots_of dust sheets out onto the ground . 
they're obviously going to do some decorating and they've got some big old sheets that they must put on the floor to protect the carpet . 
and cover some furniture . 
they've got some very big ladders <on the> [/] on the roof „ haven't they ? 
&-um . 
&-um . 
yes . 
please don't bang that , Thomas . 
I thought it was your teaspoon . 
you've been banging it on the table and it (h)as fallen on the floor . 
and it did . 
it made a sound „ didn't it ? 
like a bang . 
I think it's blackcurrant . 
is it ? 
you're Fireman_Sam Thomas . 
oh thanks Aunty_Mabel . 
you're talking now about the fire (.) at Aunty_Mabel and Pippin's house „ aren't you ? 
that's right . 
Aunty_Mabel's chip pan caught fire and the fire brigade came out „ didn't they ? 
and what happened then ? 
lots_of smoke . 
yes . 
Pippin went to get the fire engine „ didn't he ? 
he ran to the fire station and he barked and barked and barked and <the fire engine man> [//] the fireman knew there was something wrong „ didn't he ? 
and he followed Pippin back . 
and realized +... [+ PI] 
Pippin got in the fire engine and they went rushing back to Aunty_Mabel's house . 
bee^ba@o [/] bee^ba@o . 
and they found Aunty_Mabel had gone into the cupboard to get something and the cupboard had shut . 
and she couldn't get out . 
and she'd got chips cooking „ hadn't she ? 
the chip pan caught fire . 
luckily the firemen got there just in time „ didn't they ? 
well I don't think she was laughing . 
I think she was panicking but she was very [/] very pleased when Pippin brought the firemen back . 
and then she made them either a cup of tea or coffee . 
so I think that's what you're talking about there „ don't you ? 
darling , your spoon's on the floor again . 
how are you going to eat that ? 
is it ? 
ah . 
does it ? 
that's your wrist . 
what were you saying ? 
that's your +//. [+ IN] 
don't put your spoon down your pyjamas , Thomas . 
it (h)as got milk on it . 
it has got milk . 
you'll end up smelling like an old I don't know what . 
it won't be a nice chocolate . 
I can tell you that . 
your chocolates have gone because I've got to start cleaning this cupboard out . 
so I've taken all the things off the top and all the photographs off that shelf . 
and then another day we've got to empty the drinks part and empty the drawers . 
move the glass . 
and then what else has got to go ? 
all the things in your cupboard , darling . 
shall we get a big bin bag and put them all in ? 
shall we do that ? 
well you've not got many days now to play with the big cupboard . 
you've still got a lot of boxes in it . 
yes . 
we'll hafta move them „ won't we ? 
okay . 
have you had enough food ? 
right , Thomas . 
what would you like to do , darling ? 
you'd like to play with your trains on the floor . 
you mean the wooden trains . 
because you've been playing with the trains today and the racing car „ haven't you ? 
but that's the Lego one . 
do you wanna play with the wooden one . 
Mummy (h)as got to got to work soon . 
and talking of work . 
we've got a workmen arriving sometime „ haven't we ? 
shall I get the trains for you ? 
where would you like to play ? 
in here or through there with the sun . 
that would be nice though „ wouldn't it ? 
in the sunshine . 
right . 
just bear with me one second , Thomas . 
yes . 
I'll bring the trains for you . 
yes . 
I'll get the train track for you . 
right . 
right . 
there you are . 
there's the track and there are the trains . 
quite alright . 
oops . 
steady [/] steady [/] steady . 
now can I start putting these other trains back ? 
because we've got an awful lot of things in the house „ haven't we ? 
alright . 
I'm going to straighten the chairs . 
I'm straightening the chairs . 
I'm going to put the cushions back neatly and then you [>] mustn't touch them again . 
because when Grandma and Grandad come what will they say ? 
oh what a mess . 
won't they ? 
will they ? 
they'll say what a mess Thomas . 
I bet they will . 
you probably won't tell them it was you playing with the cushion . 
you'll probably blame Mummy „ won't you ? 
ah would you do that ? 
that's not nice „ is it ? 
you're very [/] very good at building the train track now „ aren't you ? 
what big naughty things ? 
does Daddy +... [+ IN]

what sort of naughty things does Daddy do ?

please may I just move that box onto the floor , darling .

how about moving nearer here .

there's some sun coming through the window . 
and it's really nice here . 
you'd be better a little bit closer this way „ wouldn't you ? 
Mummy better write Helen's birthday card and we can stick a stamp on it .
