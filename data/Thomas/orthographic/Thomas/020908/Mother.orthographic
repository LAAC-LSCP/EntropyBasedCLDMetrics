traffic signs ? 
that's right . 
you're a good boy tidying up „ aren't you ? 
aren't you clever ? 
I think you are . 
oh [=! sighs] [<] . 
no [<] I think you do , Thomas . 
you might not be wet now but if we don't change you you will soon . 
<let's take> [<] [/] let's take your shoes off . 
come on . 
lie down now . 
would you like a pillow ? 
no ? 
that's right . 
lie the other way so I can see your face . 
cheeky . 
<you've got these> [<] [/] you've got these very bright yellow trousers on again „ haven't you ? 
I'm going to let Purdie in . 
then she can be eating her lunch while you're up here „ can't she ? 
no she's not under the settee . 
she's there . 
there . 
there . 
you can see her . 
Thomas ! 
you don't spit at Purdie . 
you don't spit at anybody . 
why are you making that sound ? 
oh . 
what are you doing ? 
pretending to be a bee bah ? 
pardon ? 
that's right . 
that's what fire engines say . 
<are you> [<] pretending your lorry's a fire engine ? 
oh right . 
is your vest +//. [+ N] 
your vest feels a little bit wet „ doesn't it ? 
will you just sit one minute while I get a clean vest ? 
oh no . 
we can't do Purdie's handprints with that „ can we ? 
you're banging a piece of cheese on the worktop ? 
it's actually your (..) moisturizing cream that you're just banging on the table „ aren't you ? 
oh I've got +/. [+ N] 
a white van ? 
yes . 
tell you what , Thomas , we've only just got in in time because it's raining quite heavily now „ isn't it ? 
where've we been this morning ? 
you don't know ? 
where've you just come from ? 
B and Q ? 
we've not been to B and Q . 
we've been to the toddler group . 
lady carry a pushchair ? 
who was that ? 
oh when we arrived ? 
yes [<] that's right . 
the lady tried to help us with the [/] the pushchair getting through the door . 
but it was easier when you got out „ wasn't it ? 
and walked in . 
and then Mummy could just <push the pushchair> [//] lift the pushchair in . 
there [<] we are . 
let's put your jumper back on . 
Thomas ! 
hello , Purdie . 
nice to see you . 
that's nice of you to say so . 
you blowing kiss at her ? 
she is nice „ isn't she ? 
and your nappie . 
shh . 
Thomas , don't . 
you're whistling ? 
oh well you were doing that at toddler group because they had a recorder there „ didn't they ? 
and at the end we did (..) &-uh Grand_Old_Duke_Of_York and Humptey_Dumptey . 
and something else (.) banging instruments „ didn't we ? 
I can't remember what the other one was . 
and you had a tambourine (.) but then at the end you found a little blue recorder „ didn't you ? 
you wanted it because it was a bit noisy ? 
is that what the lady said ? 
it's a bit noisy ? 
did she say that to just you or to everybody ? 
everybody . 
I couldn't tell what she was saying because of the noise . 
well that's Purdie sharpening her claws on the cat scratcher . 
we've got a scratcher underneath the scratching post underneath the stairs . 
because pussy cats needta sharpen their claws . 
and they go outside and do that on trees . 
but it's not very nice weather outside now so when she can't go out we've got a scratching post inside . 
well [<] wait to put your slippers on until we've got your trousers back on . 
otherwise we're not going to be able to get your trousers over the top of the slippers „ are we ? 
and you went to activity time this morning „ didn't you ? 
could you not find Mummy ? 
well Mummy had popped into the kitchen to take a cup of coffee back . 
or at least the empty cup back . 
and when I walked out you (h)ad disappeared . 
were you looking for Mummy ? 
so you (h)ad just disappeared through the activity time doors ? 
and what was everybody making this morning ? 
they were making fishes . 
yes you did . 
because Mummy cut you a cardboard fish . 
Mummy cut the shape of an orange fish out of the orange cardboard . 
and then we had some glue „ didn't we ? 
and little bits of silver and gold . 
and we hadta glue an eye onto the fish . 
and then (..) some bits of gold and silver paper that were sposta be (..) scales . 
but you didn't really wanna do it „ did you ? 
next [<] [/] next week we'll try to go into activity time properly though , Thomas . 
because I think you'd enjoy it , darling . 
you don't like Purdie ? 
well why did you say then you didn't like Purdie ? 
we were talking about activity time . 
activity time . 
what would you like me to do again ? 
activity time . 
well we'll do it next week . 
we'll actually go in . 
we'll go in together right at the start . 
and then we can watch what the lady wants us to do . 
and then we can copy „ can't we ? 
the lady shows us what to do and then we all get some things (..) to do the same . 
but anyway we've brought the fish home „ haven't we ? 
so we can stick some more things on it at home „ can't we ? 
and finish it off here . 
but I think you'd enjoy it . 
what're you looking at ?

what about the radiator ? 
Thomas ! 
well who are you ? 
you don't know who you are ? 
oh well I think you're , Thomas . 
no I don't think you are Thomas . 
because Thomas is a good boy . 
and (.) &-uh (.) the little boy who's sitting next to me is getting a bit ratty „ isn't he ? 
so I don't think it can be my Thomas . 
<right we'll leave your> [<] +... [+ N] 
he's hiding behind the cushion .

you don't feel very nice ? 
just a moment , darling . 
let's wash your hand . 
Thomas , come along . 
shh . 
listen (.) we always wash your hands before meal time because you've been touching lots_of things . 
you've been playing all morning . 
and then we've walked home . 
because we walked home with Jo and Becky and we called in at Louise's house „ didn't we ? 
to see Louise and Rachel . 
and then we went to the shop . 
and then we went to Jo and Becky's house to drop her off . 
and now we've come home . 
so we've been a long way . 
and you've touched a lot of things . 
you hafta have your hands washed . 
xxx [<] . 
are you starting with a cold ? 
because your cheeks feel red and you're a bit snuffily „ aren't you ?

it might have been on Friday (.) and you (..) wolfed it down „ didn't you ? 
<it was> [<] because it was just before Dimitra came „ wasn't it ? 
and I was on the phone to Elaine and you helped yourself to a sausage roll . 
and you got it everywhere .

that's [<] quite alright , darling . 
I hope you enjoy it . 
whoops [<] . 
does it taste good ? 
it's nice ? 
it's your favorite . 
would you like a bag of Quavers as well ? 
yes please . 
you're probably quite hungry because you haven't really eaten very much over [>] the past few days . 
have you ? 
there you are . 
shall [<] I put the Quavers onto your plate ? 
straight onto your plate ? 
there (.) and then the bag's not crackling „ is it ? 
and I think Mummy will have some . 
but Mummy's going to have the prawn cocktail flavor . 
so who else did we see this morning ? 
pardon ? 
no Sonia and Isabelle weren't there „ were they ? 
I thought they should have been . 
they said they were going away at the weekend . 
so perhaps they haven't come back yet . 
either that or they're poorly because (..) Sonia and Rod's cars were both outside „ weren't they ? 
and I think if they (h)ad gone away they'd have taken one of the cars with them so +... [+ N] 
+, perhaps Isabelle's not well or they're not well . 
and who else did you see ? 
you saw Jonathan „ didn't you ? 
but Rachel wasn't there . 
she's at nursery . 
and who else ? 
you don't know ? 
what about Ben and Charlotte ? 
just [<] +... [+ N] 
who was there ? 
were both Ben and Charlotte there ? 
no Ben . 
no Ben's at nursery as well . 
it was just Lynne and Charlotte „ wasn't it ? 
did you try the coleslaw ? 
is it nice ? 
are you too busy eating to talk ? 
yes ? 
well shall we talk later on ? 
you wanna count them ? 
just thinking there's lots_of bits on this „ aren't there ? 
well do you remember before Christmas +/. [+ N] 
our little advent village . 
we put this together „ didn't we ? 
Father_Christmas in that one ? 
let's have look . 
yes that's right because that's Santa's grotto „ isn't it ? 
you want a kiss ? 
you wanna kiss Santa ? 
oh that's 0a [*] nice boy . 
just before we look at this let's give you some Calpol because I don't think you're very well . 
again [<] [/] again . 
yeah . 
just a moment . 
let's just have a couple of spoons of this . 
that's right . 
it's a church . 
there you are . 
open wide . 
a village ? 
it's like the archers „ isn't it ? 
there you are . 
another spoonful . 
right . 
it's one thirty , Thomas . 
so if you need any more medicine you can have some at half past five . 
I hope you don't but I just don't think you're +/. [+ N] 
have you ? 
+, I don't think you're a hundred percent . 
are you ? 
&=laughs . 
you're building a big blockage ? 
well look (.) this is the advent village before Christmas that we put together . 
and we put chocolates in each of the houses „ didn't we ? 
but then before Christmas +/. [+ N] 
it's alright . 
before Christmas you weren't feeling all that good . 
you weren't very well . 
so some days you didn't open the village . 
so now <we've got chocolates> [>] . 
open it . 
well shall we go round the houses one by one ? 
let's find number one . 
where's number one in the village ? 
because it really needs to be put away now . 
it's been sitting on the chest of drawers upstairs . 
where's number one , Thomas ? 
oh this is number one . 
it's this little house look . 
a little house . 
you wanna open it ? 
look we've got a nice tin here . 
they all needta go back inside the tin „ don't they ? 
<and we've got a> [>] +... [+ N] 
and we've got a jar there that's still got some chocolates left in it . 
and when we're taking sweets out of the houses we can put the chocolates back in the jar „ can't we ? 
there's nothing in number one . 
where's number two ? 
no . 
that's number sixteen . 
we're looking for house number two . 
oh here we are . 
it is . 
it's another house over here look . 
next to the sweetie shop . 
<I've got to remember to> [<] take the blue tack off the bottom of the little houses because the blue tack was sticking it to the village base „ wasn't it ? 
oh there's something in number two . 
what is it ? 
a gold ball (.) because we put +/. [+ N] 
two (.) that's right . 
are you going to put them in the sweetie jar ? 
don't hold them in your hands too long otherwise they'll melt . 
we started off by just putting one chocolate in each house and then we bought more chocolate balls . 
so we put three in each one so Mummy (.) Daddy and Thomas could each have a chocolate . 
this is why some of them have chocolates in and some don't . 
<we don't> [//] we didn't all get them each day „ did we ? 
we're looking for house number three , Thomas . 
this is number house . 
it's a house like number one and number two . 
look (.) what have they got on the door ? 
it's a doggy waiting . 
can you see all the holly ? 
the holly wreath . 
we had a wreath „ didn't we ? 
is there something inside number three ? 
we hafta open it quite gently „ don't we ? 
having a job opening this , Thomas . 
there we are . 
oh look . 
there's one in number three . 
hm: . 
I think these must be Mummy's chocolates . 
I think Thomas and Daddy had theirs . 
don't think I had time to think about chocolate „ did I ? 
just pop them in the jar . 
don't hold them , love , or they're going to go soft and melt „ aren't they ? 
number four now . 
where's number four ? 
which one do you think is number four ? 
do you think the church is number four ? 
no the church is fourteen . 
it does have a four on it . 
it (h)as got a one and a four . 
and that (h)as got a four and that's twenty four . 
but we can't see just number four „ can we ? 
we've got to find number four first , Tom . 
was there a red one in the church ? 
you've taken that one out „ have you ? 
oh here's number four ! 
this is a big house . 
is it a house ? 
oh no (.) it's the toy shop . 
number four [<] was the toy shop (.) look . 
let's take the blue tack off the bottom . 
I think we'll leave this blue tack in the tin . 
it'll stay quite fresh till next year „ won't it ? 
0 [=! gasps] . 
what can we see in the toy shop window ? 
teddy bears and a +... [+ N] 
yes . 
and a boat ? 
and there's a lovely Christmas tree outside of the toy shop „ isn't there ? 
with a star on top . 
pardon ? 
that's probably Mummy's chocolate from the toy shop . 
I don't think I should shut these again . 
because next Christmas we'll have a job opening them . 
number five . 
I can see it . 
it's another house . 
oh you want a train ? 
alright . 
I'll get one for you . 
number five (.) look a little house . 
and what's the lady doing ? 
she's opening the door to let +... [+ N] 
to let Purdie in . 
there's a pussy cat . 
right . 
we'll open the lid of the house . 
the roof . 
and there's yes gold ball . 
right . 
you'd like a train „ would you ? 
the lego train ? 
the lego train . 
I'm not sure where it is , Thomas . 
it'll take me a minute to find it . 
we've tidied all you toys away now „ haven't we ? 
into a big toy box . 
I can't find anything . 
you want the dumper truck ? 
that's right . 
you can fill it with chocolates „ can't you ? 
just a minute now [>] . 
oh you've got them all in your dumper truck . 
I really don't know where you train is , Thomas . 
that's the +... [+ N] 
+, pussy cat and the horse that belong with the train . 
and there's the train cab . 
you going to put them in the cab ? 
I think we'll hafta have a good sort through this . 
have you ? 
you [<] dropped it in the cab ? 
well [>] +... [+ N] 
you dropped it . 
xxx . 
well this is the wooden train set . 
look there's a (..) a small carriage there that you can put chocolates in . 
the train'll pull that „ won't it ? 
shall we get both trains and then we can pull them either way ? 
I thought your lego train might have been in there . 
we'll hafta have a good look between us , Thomas . 
when we've finished doing this . 
oh I've found it . 
you dropped a green one „ have you ? 
you found a gold one on the floor as well . 
what're your slippers doing off ? 
have you taken both your slippers off ? 
why ? 
pat ? 
are you pating the top of my head when I'm bending down to pick up the chocolates you've dropped ? 
is that funny ? 
pating Mummy's head ? 
well I'll pick them up in a moment . 
let's just get this train put together „ shall we ? 
I don't know where the driver is . 
there you are . 
finally the lego train . 
I'll just have a quick glance in here and see if I can see them . 
can you ? 
no , Thomas ! 
I'm not picking them up anymore . 
if you drop them they stay on the floor . 
and [<] that's it . 
that's the last time I'm picking them up . 
if you drop anymore (.) they've got to stay on the floor . 
okay ? 
those two just fit in nicely there „ don't they ? 
look the horse's going to watch and the pussy cat's going to sit on the train cab . 
where had we got up to ? 
number five ? 
number five of course . 
right (.) now where's number six ? 
where do we think number six is ? 
we keep looking at that one and it's number twenty four . 
here's number six . 
ah (.) what's in the garden of number six ? 
snowman . 
what's he wearing ? 
a yellow scarf and a hat . 
and do you know what he's smoking ? 
Roy the builder smokes one of those . 
it's a pipe . 
it's not a cigarette (.) it's a pipe . 
Liz smokes a pipe as well . 
Mummy's friend Liz . 
oh now this one , Thomas , number six you must have opened that before Christmas because it's stuck together with a lot of Sellotape . 
do you remember one day when Mummy was busy doing something and you got hold of the advent village and ripped open all the rooms to get the chocolates out ? 
do you remember doing that ? 
I bet +/. [+ N] 
you found another ? 
yes I know . 
there were three chocolates in each of these houses . 
most of them only have one in now . 
I'm sure it's Mummy's and not yours and Daddy's . 
right (.) number seven . 
what's number seven ? 
another little house ? 
no snowman ? 
is there not ? 
<is there> [<] . 
another chocolate ball ? 
oh [<] look . 
someone (h)as been digging the snow because what's outside ? 
do you know what that is called ? 
what color chocolate ? 
a green one . 
right (.) that was number seven . 
oh now that was number seven , Thomas „ wasn't it ? 
so the day that was opened was the seventh of December . 
that was the day you saw Santa . 
at the toddler party . 
where we've been this morning . 
when we went on the seventh of December (.) Santa was there . 
and I'm sure it was quite a nice day because it's not very pleasant today . 
and it was also Purdie's birthday „ wasn't it ? 
right . 
where is number eight ? 
this is a good counting game „ isn't it ? 
I bet it's one of these small houses round here . 
it is . 
oh that's a very pretty house . 
look (.) it (h)as got timber frames . 
can you see all the beams ? 
doesn't it look beautiful ? 
you can look inside the windows . 
when Mummy was a little girl the house we lived in was number eight . 
but Grandma and Grandad have moved now and they don't live there anymore . 
it was number eight xxx . [+ I] 
another ? 
in number eight ? 
what color ? 
green . 
the horse ? 
ah you kissing the horse ? 
the horse is very clever because he's not eating them . 
he could quite easily jump into that (.) into the back of the trailer and start eating some of the chocolates „ couldn't he ? 
oh number nine is a big house , Thomas . 
<you're put> [//] oh you're putting the horse behind you „ are you ? 
you're [<] putting him behind you're back ? 
why's that ? 
he (h)as gone to B@l and Q@l ? 
you're frightened he eats the chocolate „ aren't you ? 
right . 
number nine is a very [/] very big house , Thomas . 
and they've got a parcel . 
somebody (h)as left a parcel outside of the window . 
but that's the only indication that it's Christmas in that house . 
look (.) they have a candle in the window . 
in the window . 
look can you see inside ? 
they've lit some candles on the window ledge . 
and this (.) the lid of this house looks like it (h)as got strawberry jam on it . 
&=laughs . 
I think somebody must have opened that one (.) after having jam for breakfast . 
who do you think that could have been ? 
it was Isabelle ? 
well Isabelle was here one day „ wasn't she ? 
and she was helping open the advent calendar but (..) she didn't come after breakfast . 
I'll give that wipe . 
you're putting the jar round your back ? 
a green one . 
there [<] you are . 
shall we put the green one in there ? 
in that one ? 
you want it in trailer . 
oh number nine is such a big house . 
I don't know how to get into it , Thomas . 
oh here we are (.) at the top . 
there's one thing the [/] the little houses are made from something wipe clean so +... [+ N] 
there we are . 
the gold ball's coming in the dumper truck . 
we'll put it in the train . 
now we're looking for number ten , Thomas . 
which one do you think is number ten . 
I can see number eleven . 
can you see number ten anywhere ? 
number ten . 
that's a dice . 
that's got lots_of numbers on it „ hasn't it ? 
because this little village (.) we've put all the houses on (..) filled them with chocolates to use as an advent calendar . 
but can you see along the footpath ? 
all different colored squares on the footpath . 
and they all have numbers because when you're a little bit older you can play a game with this . 
you can throw that +//. [+ N] 
let me show you . 
this is called a dice and it has numbers on it . 
then you throw it . 
and whichever number shows facing you . 
that's the number of goes you have . 
so just throw the dice gently on the table . 
and look the people in the village walk round . 
right it's number three . 
so look +//. [+ N] 
this little squirrel +//. [+ N] 
let's let him walk round three squares . 
one (.) two (.) three . 
right (.) are you going to +//. [+ N] 
oh don't crush it . 
are you going to throw the dice again ? 
right (.) and it (h)as landed on number six . 
so he can walk round one (.) two (.) three (.) four (.) five (.) six squares . 
I'm not quite sure without reading the instructions what the aim of the game is . 
but it's probably who can reach [/] reach the sweet shop or the toy shop first [>] . 
is it four chocolates ? 
well I can see number ten which is the +... [+ N] 
the post office ! 
very clever . 
very good boy [>] . 
do you think Postman_Pat has left a chocolate inside ? 
his bicycle's outside . 
on the front door they've got a beautiful wreath and a little sign that says open . 
and in the window can you see all those sparkly lights all the way round the window ? 
and there's a post box . 
and at the back (..) Bertie's bicycle . 
and yes he (h)as left you a little ball . 
what color do you think Postman_Pat's ball is ? 
well guess . 
what color van does he drive ? 
red . 
well that's the color of the little ball that's inside the house . 
there you are . 
I would imagine that's more luck than management (.) but there you are . 
number eleven . 
we saw that a few minutes ago „ didn't we ? 
thank you , dumper truck . 
so you're collecting the chocolates in the dumper truck ? 
and then what're you going to do ? 
load them up in the train ? 
would you like the big digger ? 
no ? 
is it ? 
is the digger a bit heavy ? 
right . 
okay . 
it's just I think there are going to be a lot more chocolates you know . 
we're looking for number eleven , Thomas . 
any ideas ? 
it has „ hasn't it ? 
yes . 
Santa's grotto's falling down . 
oh here's number eleven . 
it's a small house . 
alright . 
you're presuming there's a chocolate in it . 
so good job Mummy didn't eat them all „ isn't it ? 
oh look . 
they've got some streamers hanging from their house . 
and there's a child +//. [+ N] 
we don't know whether it's a boy or a girl (.) we can only see it's face peeping out of the window . 
what do you think they're looking for ? 
looking for naughty boys ? 
oh right . 
I thought they might have been looking to see if they could see Father_Christmas coming . 
or looking out of the window perhaps to see if it had been snowing . 
but you think they're looking for naughty boys ? 
right . 
well there's a chocolate here . 
the little boy (h)as got a chocolate inside of his house . 
yes . 
who's coming to collect this ? 
that train ? 
in there ? 
it's red . 
it's another red one . 
right . 
we're nearly halfway through now , Thomas , because we needta go to number twelve . 
<lots_of> [>] chocolates . 
what sort of chocolates [>] +... [+ N] 
you can see one that's slightly open ? 
you going to eat that one ? 
you can eat one . 
you can eat that one . 
ah you kissing the train ? 
thank you . 
ta@d much (in)deed . 
would you like me to take the paper off ? 
you've done it ? 
here's number twelve . 
ah (.) there's somebody else waiting on the doorstep of number twelve . 
who's that ? 
pussy cat . 
and what color is it ? 
I would imagine that's a ginger cat . 
like the one that was sitting our step a few minutes ago . 
oh that's a gold ball . 
shall I put that in the dumper truck for you ? 
then we move to number thirteen . 
you sound very snuffily , Thomas . 
where's &thir +//. [+ N] 
ah this is thirteen . 
this very [/] very big house . 
it's called Rose_Cottage but it's massive „ isn't it ? 
and there's somebody else peering out of the window . 
but I think he's definitely looking for snow because he (h)as got <his shovel> [//] his spade outside of the door . 
and it might have been snowing because it looks to me as if there's snow on the window ledge . 
but number thirteen , Thomas , is open . 
Rose_Cottage has no chocolate in it at all . 
shall we leave the bits of silver paper there ? 
perhaps the wooden train could collect all the rubbish ? 
where's the wooden train ? 
it's round your back ? 
you've hidden it ? 
oh you look nice when you look at Mummy and smile like that . 
well shall we get the train on the table ? 
will I not find it ? 
oh [<] alright . 
it's stuck . 
okay . 
number fourteen . 
was that the church ? 
yes it was the church . 
it's lovely „ isn't it ? 
I remember having a real job trying to put this together because I couldn't work out how to do the steeple . 
oh there's no chocolate in fourteen either . 
no . 
we must have all been hungry on fourteenth of December . 
fifteen is a little house . 
and instead of a pussy cat (..) who's that ? 
a dog . 
and it looks like the lady's letting the dog out . 
and there's a little girl peering through the window . 
I can tell that's a little girl even though I can only see her face because she (h)as got a pink ribbon in her hair . 
and what can you see sitting <on the drain> [//] on the chimney pot ? 
a dickie bird . 
and what sort of dickie bird „ is it ? 
<it (h)as got a> [<] +... [+ N] 
it (h)as got a red breast so what is it ? 
a zebra ? 
oh a red breast . 
I'm sorry . 
I thought you said a zebra . 
what has a red breast ? 
&saus [<] [//] sausages have red breast's ? 
what about robins ? 
do you remember robin red breast ? 
in number fifteen I can also see +//. [+ N] 
this also looks a very [/] very happy house „ doesn't it ? 
they've got a dog and they've got a little girl and the Mummy's letting the dog out . 
if you look through the window at the back (.) what can we see ? 
Christmas tree and a star on top . 
that's right . 
it was a happy house as well because it had a chocolate inside [>] . 
<two chocolates> [<] . 
right . 
and then we move to number sixteen , Thomas . 
and what can we see inside number sixteen ? 
ah [>] . 
I'm sorry . 
there's no chocolate inside sixteen . 
but there's +/. [+ IN] 
a snowman . 
and he (h)as no hat because what's the little boy doing ? 
that's right . 
the little boy's wearing a hat that looks like Father_Christmas's . 
it's red with white fur trim and a bobble . 
but the little boy (h)as lifted the snowman's hat off the snowman „ hasn't he ? 
oh perhaps he's just putting the hat on . 
what do you think ? 
do you think he's taking the hat off the snowman or is he about to put it on him ? 
I think he might be dressing him . 
yes . 
oh seventeen , Thomas . 
where's seventeen ? 
there's eighteen . 
you're opening Mummy's chocolate ? 
if you open it (.) are you going to give it to me ? 
are you ? 
that's nice . 
you've dropped it ? 
oh well never mind . 
we've plenty more . 
ah [<] . 
number seventeen is the sweet shop so there must be a chocolate inside here . 
oh guess what , Thomas ? 
we must have been hungry on the seventeenth of December because there isn't a chocolate in . 
there isn't a chocolate inside the sweetie shop . 
but the other tell tale sign is xxx chocolate finger marks on the outside that need wiping off . [+ I] 
0 [=! laughing] . 
it's for me „ is it ? 
oh that's very kind . 
oh thank you , Thomas . 
that's a good boy for sharing . 
thank you , darling . 
Thomas Lastname . 
I was just trying to reach your little train so we could put rubbish in the train . 
you want it behind your back „ do you ? 
hm: [>] . 
wow they taste good . 
I don't know . 
but you've lifted the lid of the cab and the cat looks like it's about to fall on the floor . 
it's a pussy cat sitting on top „ isn't it ? 
right (.) shall we move to number eighteen now ? 
steady . 
no <don't be> [/] don't be throwing , Thomas . 
be careful . 
oh number eighteen has nothing in it either . 
and number nineteen has nothing in it . 
number eighteen's a big house and number nineteen . 
two snowballs ? 
yes . 
there's a pussy cat looking out of the windows of number nineteen . 
oops a daisy . 
have they all fallen on the floor ? 
now (.) shall we move to number twenty ? 
where's twenty ? 
it's this one . 
this is the bakery . 
the baker's shop . 
what can you buy inside the baker's ? 
could [<] you just pick that glass up , Thomas ? 
it's the [/] the glass sweetie jar . 
because if that falls it'll smash . 
no [/] no . 
no [/] no . 
listen . 
look +/. [+ N] 
Thomas . 
if it falls on the floor it's going to smash . 
it's a +/. [+ N] 
it's [<] [/] it's made from glass , Thomas . 
if it falls it will break . 
well let's take the lid off . 
shall we start putting the chocolates back in the sweetie jar ? 
<well I> [>] +... [+ N] 
well I'm looking at the baker shop because I can see +//. [+ N] 
0 [=! gasps] . 
look [!] sausage rolls . 
and a chocolate log . 
Christmas cake . 
that has a little sign . 
do you remember the other shop that had a sign that said open ? 
was that the toy shop or the sweet shop ? 
the post office . 
oh [>] +... [+ N] 
<is there> [<] a man outside ? 
oh yes . 
I think that's Rachel's Daddy . 
that's Rachel's father (.) Mile's grandfather . 
the post office had a sign on it that said open . 
and the toy shop had a sign on it that said open . 
and the baker's says open . 
but unfortunately there's no chocolate inside . 
what's outside ? 
a snowman . 
a window man . 
<no that jar's going to> [<] fall , Thomas . 
no . 
<it's rolling> [//] it was rolling off the table . 
if it falls on the floor there'll be a whoosh [!] big splash . 
come on . 
calm down . 
number twenty one . 
you don't want the lid on it ? 
well it doesn't really matter because it's going on the floor anyway „ isn't it ? 
number twenty one (..) has nobody in at all . 
but they've got <a spade> [//] two spades . 
<well that's> [>] +... [+ N] 
you wanna put the box in the dumper truck ? 
number twenty one . 
be gentle with it , Thomas . 
be careful . 
that's right . 
oh and number twenty two (.) that's the grocer's . 
and that says open as well . 
what do you think the grocer's is selling ? 
what [>] +... [+ N] 
sausage rolls ? 
it might do . 
look . 
what are they ? 
full of beads ? 
I think they're green peas and bananas „ aren't they ? 
<or perhaps> [<] they're brussel sprouts . 
they'll be brussel sprouts „ won't they ? 
ah (.) then we get to number twenty three which is the florist . 
now that says open . 
did the (..) greengrocer's say it was open ? 
<is it a> [<] greengrocer's or a grocer's ? 
let's have a look . 
&-uh (..) just the grocer's . 
yes . 
the grocer's . 
you want a digger ? 
number twenty three <is the florist> [>] . 
okay . 
is this empty ? 
yes . 
number twenty three's empty . 
the florist . 
but they're selling Christmas trees and plants and flowers . 
and the very last one is number twenty four and that's <Santa's grotto> [>] . 
okay . 
and we know who's inside Santa's grotto „ don't we ? 
because we can see him . 
who is it ? 
you don't know ? 
Santa . 
don't rip it , darling . 
<the big> [<] +... [+ N] 
big digger ? 
with the digger man ? 
you heard a little sound ? 
it was the drawer of the toy box closing I think . 
there (.) so that's all put away now for another year „ isn't it ? 
you want a big box ? 
there was . 
there was just a little bit of foil . 
I was just going to wrap the blue tack in a bit of foil and keep it in the box . 
to hold a piece of foil ? 
there you are . 
why are you putting it in your ear , Thomas ? 
putting kitchen foil in your ear ? 
so next Christmas we'll either hafta get the same sweets or get something that's going to fit inside but (..) those little chocolate balls worked quite well „ didn't they ? 
we managed to get three in most of the houses . 
I think some of the tiny houses only allowed us to put two in . 
I was just going to have a look at the instructions to see what we hadta do . 
oh it's called Santas's game . 
oh I see , Thomas . 
you each hafta throw the dice . 
the die I think it's called . 
the die . 
and whoever scores the highest can start . 
and everybody hasta start at the post office . 
and they hafta move round the village green until they get to Santa's grotto . 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
oh dear . 
so we opened each of the buildings everyday but I think you can play the [/] the game . 
and whoever throws the highest can open the chocolate of that day . 
<I think that's> [<] how it goes . 
what is it you've lost , sweetheart ? 
the [/] the box with all the little houses in ? 
it's there . 
but we hafta put them away now till next Christmas , Thomas . 
don't tip them out . 
because they're [/] they're quite fragile these houses . 
oh . 
now that's very clever . 
well shall we do that then ? 
let's put all of the houses on the table (.) carefully . 
and <then you> [>] scoop up +//. [+ N] 
one at a time you scoop a house . 
you scoop up a house one at a time and tip it into the tin that we're storing them in . 
how's that ? 
that's the bakery . 
thank you . 
and which one's this ? 
number twenty one . 
that's a good game „ isn't it ? 
and number twelve . 
that's right . 
and that's the little house .
