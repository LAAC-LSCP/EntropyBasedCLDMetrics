the blue van . 
there's a man walking .

would you like to go and get your tractor and farm animals and we'll have a look and see what's (.) happening on the farm today ? 
that's right . 
a tractor . 
what color are the tractor wheels , Thomas ? 
yellow ? 
there's the dog . 
there's the cow . 
moo@o . 
and what's this ? 
pig . 
what's the pig's name ? 
and what's this ? 
<the lamb> [//] the sheep . 
what does the sheep say ? 
baa_baa . 
the sheep's wool made your jumper . 
you're wearing a woolly jumper „ aren't you ? 
and that's the farmer . 
where's the farmer's shoes ? 
they're probably Wellingtons . 
where's the farmer's Wellingtons ? 
and he (h)as got trousers . 
and a jacket . 
and a shirt . 
and a hat . 
he's wearing a hat . 
there's his jacket . 
and his shirt . 
and his trousers . 
and he (h)as got green Wellingtons on . 
Mummy (h)as got Wellingtons but her's are black . 
Thomas has Wellingtons (.) and they're blue with the Teletubbies on them . 
are you tired ? 
that's the tractor . 
are you pushing the tractor ? 
what's this , Thomas ? 
does the bus go for a ride in the tractor ? 
there's the farmer . 
can he drive ? 
he can drive . 
and the cow . 
and the pig . 
<oink_oink> [/] oink_oink . 
and the dog . 
and there's the sheep . 
all done . 
is the tractor full now ? 
what else is there room for ? 
some apples . 
what about poping some apples and some eggs in the tractor because they come from the farm „ don't they ? 
and the hens on the farm lay eggs . 
so you might like to put some eggs on the tractor . 
a lot of farms have orchards with apple trees . 
so we can put some green apples and a red apple . 
yes some pears might grow in the orchard . 
yes . 
would you like the tune ? 
that's Old_MacDonald_had_a_farm . 
and look . 
a bottle of milk because the milk comes from the cow . 
so we've got eggs apples pears (.) and milk . 
but I think the oranges (.) xxx the pineapples and the lemons and the grapes (.) xxx grow in a hotter country . [+ I] 
and they could come by train . 
yes an orange so it's very possible that Thomas_The_Tank_Engine (.) and his trailer +... [+ N] 
he could have (.) oranges and grapes and bananas and lemons because he's bringing them from hot country . 
shall we put bananas and lemons and oranges and grapes and pineapple <into the back of Thomas> [//] into Thomas's carriages . 
are you pushing Thomas . 
yes . 
right our hour must be up Thomas because the tape's switched off . 
I don't know what that was but it was a click that sounded like a tape . 
but we haven't got a tape . 
we could have a helicopter as well . 
an aeroplane and a I think (.) it's highly likely that the apples rather than orange and the lemon and the pineapple (.) they will be flown in a helicopter or an aeroplane . 
oh that's noisy . 
&=laughs . 
is that the helicopter ? 
in your Thomas_The_Tank_Engine books what is the helicopter called ? 
mummum@c that's what you say but what's it called ? 
Harold ? 
is he called Harold ? 
Harold_the_Helicopter . 
he flies in the sky . 
watch the helicopter . 
is Thomas playing with is train ? 
what does the train say ? 
choo_choo . 
that's the blue van it has driven away and we've missed it . 
the blue van has gone . 
all gone . 
Mummy's going to wind the helicopter up (.) with a key . 
a key . 
oh dear . 
pop the key in there . 
and <turn the key> [/] turn the key . 
and oh it (h)as crashed . 
the helicopter . 
are you putting the key ? 
putting the key in the helicopter and turn it . 
that's nice and bright „ isn't it ? 
what has happened ? 
the propeller has fallen off . 
they're blue „ aren't they ? 
the helicopter's red blue yellow and green . 
and the propellers are blue and they go round <and round> [/] and round . 
like the wheels on the bus the propellers go round and round . 
it keeps falling off „ doesn't it ? 
I think it's nearly time for lunch . 
what would you like to eat ? 
there's a little bit of chicken and a bake from last night . 
you don't fancy that . 
and you'll probably like some fruit . 
what fruit would you like ? 
grapes ? 
and banana and pears . 
and an apple . 
choc@f ? 
I don't think you can have any chocolate . 
mind you you still have Easter eggs to eat „ haven't you ?
