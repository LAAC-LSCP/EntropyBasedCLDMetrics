what did you say ? 
you do needta wash your hands . 
you're right . 
be careful . 
what were we saying about +/. [+ IN] 
that's because you've got the stool resting on my shoes . 
it's not on the floor . 
what were you saying , Thomas ? 
you could have a wall built by the patio and Felix would think what ? 
Felix will think it's a scrap yard ? 
you're talking about the cat next door ? 
oh I see . 
right . 
let's dry your hands , please . 
does it ? 
right [>] . 
right . 
I can hear Daddy's Furbie in the background . 
right . 
now we've got the scales . 
Daddy's toy . 
yes . 
you can . 
would you just like to drop under the table , please . 
we've dropped one of the weights . 
it's a small gold weight . 
a brass weight . 
the gold colored one . 
very good . 
it's a long way away under the table „ isn't it ? 
very good . 
right . 
I'm looking for some eggs in the fridge . 
can you see any eggs , Thomas ? 
there we are . 
I can see them right at the back . 
are you going to help me get the ingredients ? 
seeing it works properly . 
do you think it does ? 
right . 
<are they > [<] ? 
the sharp bits . 
the pointy bits ? 
yes . 
now we've got two spoons (be)cause we'll each need a spoon „ won't we ? 
well I was getting you the little one actually . 
do you ? 
right . 
could you move please now (be)cause I need the stool to get into the cupboard to get the flour and the sugar . 
right . 
well we've got lots_of wooden spoons . 
instruments „ are they ? 
no . 
don't bang please , Thomas . 
stop it now . 
pinching the stool again . 
careful . 
right . 
now . 
<get a spoon> [>] . 
what ? 
yes well we're not at that stage yet , Thomas . 
you're very excited „ aren't you ? 
right what we needta do +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
+, is to put that there . 
we needta weigh some sugar so +/. [+ IN] 
okay . 
make sure it (h)as (be)cause we haven't even taken the lid off the sugar bowl . 
come here . 
that's it . 
that's (be)cause we've got too much . 
going to make some little buns „ aren't we ? 
mhm . 
like sweet sugar ? 
well sugar is very sweet „ isn't it ? 
no , don't . 
<no no> [/] no . 
if you press on there (.) then we'll be weighing your finger as well as the sugar and we'll think we've got enough „ won't I ? 
are you going to pop the sugar into the bowl ? 
clever boy . 
right . 
I'm going to get a little piece of kitchen paper to line +/. [+ IN] 
+, and let's weigh all this soft margarine . 
does it not feel soft ? 
well it (h)as just come out of the fridge . 
the container's not soft „ is it ? 
there we are . 
cold . 
yes , that's because it (h)as been in the fridge . 
there we are . 
now you've got to tell me again when the scale goes down and we've got enough . 
watch your head . 
did it move a little bit then ? 
perhaps we don't need too much more do you think ? 
oh . 
has it nearly gone down ? 
don't keep jogging the table , Thomas . 
it'll affect the weight . 
that's it . 
do we need a bit more ? 
has it gone down ? 
have we ? 
right . 
there . 
are we right ? 
jolly good . 
you can . 
not yet . 
you can in a minute . 
no , Thomas . 
don't do that . 
listen , when you're cooking you've got to keep things away from your face . 
you start banging your head with a wooden spoon we can't use that to mix cakes „ can we ? 
because your hair (h)as got urgh all sorts in it . 
it walks to the bus in the morning and goes outside . 
if you put your wooden spoon on your head it might get on the wooden spoon . 
then it'll go in the cakes and you've got to eat it . 
xxx [>] . 
right . 
shall we put the margarine and the sugar ? 
well I think you're thinking of the pastry mince pies . 
we need wooden spoons now . 
lovely . 
are you ? 
is it ? 
well I hope this isn't making too much noise . 
I needta xxx , Tom .[+ PI] 
let me help . 
right . 
that's how's that . 
do you make cakes at nursery ? 
oh no . 
don't tip it out . 
and what happens at nursery ? 
who does the mixing ? 
does she ? 
are you allowed to mix as well ? 
why aren't you mixing now ? 
so these cakes should be absolutely perfect (be)cause you know what you're doing „ don't you ? 
make sure it stays in the bowl , please . 
(be)cause if it spills out of the bowl +/. [+ IN] 
+, the cakes won't work and we won't have the right ingredients „ will we ? 
a big machine „ is it ? 
a crushing machine ? 
just looks like a wooden spoon . 
is it cement you're mixing ? 
did you ? 
I saw you look out of the window . 
that's why I stopped and had a quick look . 
wondered what you were looking at but I can't actually see anybody . 
when the Tweenies were on . 
you saw a big truck driving off . 
that wouldn't be Daddy in a big truck „ would it ? 
unless Daddy (h)as suddenly started driving big trucks and not told me . 
now what do you think to that ? 
that's a nice mixture „ isn't it ? 
now we've got to beat and beat and beat this +/. [+ IN] 
until it gets almost white and very fluffy . 
and soft . 
now just let me use your spoon to scrape my spoon . 
and then I'm going to have a little listen in the headphones while you're mixing . 
then if it's too noisy then Mummy will just give it a little mix on her own . 
without the tape going . 
okay ? 
that's right . 
do you wanna sing a little song while you're mixing ? 
oh that's a good song . 
very good , Thomas . 
no [/] no . 
the singing wasn't too loud I was just a bit worried about the mixing the sugar mixing . 
that's it . 
I'll give that a really good beat up in a minute . 
oop . 
don't put it up there . 
you're the waiter „ are you ? 
are you ? 
am I ? 
oh . 
fair enough . 
I'm a waitress . 
so I get the job of serving the cakes when they're cooked „ do I ? 
right . 
do you know why we're making cakes ? 
why ? 
for Christmas ? 
well yes . 
&=laughs . 
making the cakes not licking the mixture . 
listen . 
what about Purdie's birthday ? 
<no no> [/] no . 
don't eat anymore mixture or the cakes won't work . 
just let Mummy give it a quick beat . 
just to get it softer . 
let go of your spoon . 
it's Purdie's birthday . 
how old is Purdie now ? 
no [/] no . 
how old ? 
she's eighteen „ isn't she today ? 
eighteen . 
that's a big age for a pussy cat „ isn't it ? 
that's four times as old as you . 
well I think it might be a little bit noisy that's why I'm going to try and do it very quickly (.) (be)cause if I do it quickly (..) then I can get on to doing something a bit quieter . 
so when we've made the cakes we'll ice them and then put something on top . 
can you ? 
right . 
let me scrape my spoon onto your one . 
and you do a bit of mixing now with your spoon . 
alright then . 
well that's right you've got to eat the savory things first „ haven't you ? 
I think at your birthday party which is in April . 
that's a long time away . 
be in the spring „ won't it ? 
it is (be)cause it's winter now . 
how about some crisps ? 
things like hula hoops and ordinary crisps and little cheesy whatsits ? 
and some sandwiches ? 
what sort of sandwiches would you like ? 
cheese and ham ? 
what about some jam ones ? 
cheese jam and ham sandwiches . 
had we better have some sweets ? 
oh right . 
okay . 
&-um and how about some jelly and ice cream . 
no . 
what you gonna have at the top of your cake ? 
jelly tots ? 
well I was actually wondering about getting some jelly babies and jelly tots to go on top of these buns when we've made them . 
xxx [>] . 
jelly tots they look a little bit like smarties you know sort of +/. [+ IN] 
right . 
they're flat and round but they're all sugary „ aren't they on the outside ? 
they look . 
long ? 
well a whole packet might take a long time to eat . 
they're like colored magic saucers that Jack Frost has sprinkled his frosty dust on „ aren't they ? 
sparkly . 
no , not yet (be)cause I think we all could do some s@l . 
<no no no> [/] no . 
sausages . 
would you like sausages at your party ? 
and how about some little +/. [+ IN] 
no not yet . 
and how about some little chicken nuggets ? 
bits of pizza . 
oh well I don't think if we're going to hire the church hall perhaps . 
there's Rachel there . 
perhaps if we're going to hire the church hall we can't do a lot of things like that . 
we'll have things that are ready but we can have some little bits of pizza . 
ready . 
steady . 
cook . 
&=laughs . 
nana and Grandad like ready steady cook „ don't they ? 
no be careful with those . 
oh is it mashed potato ? 
wow . 
do you know what you could do , Thomas ? 
we could do with putting a big chef's hat on you . 
I haven't got a chef's hat . 
I've got a Santa hat somewhere . 
don't know where it is . 
it'll be in the loft somewhere (be)cause we don't start getting Christmas things ready until Purdie (h)as had her birthday „ do we ? 
I was just looking to see if I had a little party hat in the drawer but I don't think I have . 
everything's in the loft with the Christmas decorations . 
what [//] what's poke +/. [+ IN] 
oh it's off a bib „ isn't it ? 
it's a string off a bib . 
right . 
come back . 
because &-um once Purdie's birthday is over with <then we start xxx > [>] . [+ PI] 
actually we've +/. [+ IN] 
are you ? 
we've already done a little bit of Christmasy things +/. [+ IN]

when you xxx through your eyes you haven't a clue what you're doing „ have you ? 
silly chef . 
can you ? 
oh alright then . 
that's clever . 
don't hang that over your mouth or your nose or you won't be able to breathe and also I won't be able to hear what you're telling me . 
no . 
you can hear what I'm saying but I might not be able to tell what you're saying very clearly if you cover your mouth . 
are you the blind chef ? 
it's beautiful green cake mixture there blind chef . 
what a beautiful green cake mixture . 
do you think it's green ? 
&=laughs . 
no . 
it's not green „ is it ? 
a nice mix up „ aren't we ? 
be careful . 
be careful with that on there . 
what could be a chef's hat ? 
alright . 
Thomas , no . 
you mustn't . 
you've got dirty hands love . 
you've been mixing . 
what do you want ? 
no . 
Thomas come here please .

silly_billy@wp . 
that's a nice birthday thing as well „ isn't it ? 
what do you think Purdie would like balloons for her birthday ? 
one two three .[+ R] 
is it ? 
I think we're doing quite a good job with this . 
have you noticed how it (h)as changed in color from yellow to it's almost well it's creamy white now „ isn't it ? 
I don't wanna mix it too much (be)cause of the noise . 
nice and soft it drops off the spoon easily now „ doesn't it ? 
well Purdie's birthday's today . 
that's the seventh of December . 
well we haven't got balloons up yet , no . 
Nana's birthday is on the thirteenth of December .

now that day +/. [+ IN] 
in a minute . 
how about next Friday doing a big cake for a joint Nana and Purdie's birthday . 
do you think Nana would like that ? 
I imagine Nana would say “I've never had a birthday cake with a cat before” . 
but we could have a joint little party for Nana and Purdie (.) „ couldn't we ? 
yeah . 
do you think she'll like that ? 
put these little buns for us tonight and we can put these +/. [+ IN] 
let me just mix this a bit more then we needta add the eggs . 
is it hurting your ears , Thomas ? 
never thought anything would be too noisy for you . 
excuse me . 
now that's a rude thing to say . 
you don't tell Mummy to mind her own business . 
that's naughty , Thomas . 
<bell pussy's in the well> [=! sings] . 
don't dip the scale pan when it bangs down . 
right . 
we'll be one more minute then [>] we'll be putting the eggs in . 
Thomas , stop shouting . 
you're much more noisy than the cake mix . 
stop . 
there . 
beautiful . 
now . 
rather than putting the egg straight into the cake mixture we do them one at a time into this little bowl . 
we need two eggs . 
that's it . 
right . 
<are you going to break> [//] just one at a time , please . 
no [/] no [/] no . 
one at a time . 
very carefully we tap it on the side of that . 
ooh . 
there we are . 
don't touch it now . 
no . 
don't do anything at the minute . 
has it ? 
oh . 
has it ? 
no [/] no [/] no [/] no . 
mustn't touch those , please . 
tiny tiny fraction of shell . 
that's it . 
if you drop eggs they are terrible to clean up . 
now with the fork shall we give it a little whip ? 
a little beat ? 
look at that . 
what color (h)as it gone now ? 
wanna sit down a minute ? 
no [/] no [/] no [/] . 
they break easily . 
don't play with them . 
I just thought you might be tired of standing . 
are you alright ? 
do you wanna have a little mix ? 
give it a little mix . 
<now before we put it in here we wanna weigh out> [>] some flour (.) because when we <put the egg in here > [>2] . 
alright well we'll do that now . 
when we weigh up when we add the egg we wanna pop a little [>] drop of flour in the mix as well . 
but we'll need another egg in a minute , Thomas . 
right . 
shall we [>] weigh out some flour ? 
it's a bag of flour „ isn't it ? 
right now I needta do the same as I did with the margarine and the sugar . 
that's right . 
you look and tell me when the flour . 
done now . 
right . 
yes ? 
do you wanna come and stand back here . 
it's called a spatula . 
<and that> [>] that's for scraping the bowl out of the cake mix when we've finished . 
hm . 
yes . 
up where has gone red , darling ? 
the [/] the microphone ? 
that's [//] silly_billy@wp . 
that's the burglar alarm . 
that's not the &-um microphone „ is it ? 
no . 
no . 
there's one microphone there look above the patio door there's another one up on the welsh dresser and the burglar alarm is in the corner of the room . 
now . 
would you like to go and get the sieve from the top of the cooker please and then we're ready to add a bit of flour and the egg . 
mind the equipment , darling please . 
come round this way . 
alright . 
you go the scenic route will you just as long as you don't tread on tape recorders . 
the sieve , please . 
on top of the cooker . 
it's like a pan but it (h)as got lots_of holes in it . 
that's it . 
oh . 
&=laughs [>] . 
I told you not to put a wooden spoon on your head and you come back from kitchen with a sieve on your head . 
stand there . 
let me go and get the mirror . 
stand there . 
you do look funny (be)cause you've got two little hooks and the back of your head and they look like ears . 
&=laughs . 
what do you think you look like ? 
a silver fan ? 
it's called a sieve . 
right . 
now . 
we (h)ad better give that a quick sort out . 
right . 
it's [//] do you know it's a bit like a fishing net . 
I think I've just got to stop worrying about things like that . 
smacking it ? 
I was just giving it a bit of a shake to get anything out of it that might have gone in . 
right . 
now . 
what we needta do now . 
let's tip <this egg> [>] from this bowl . 
into there . 
do you ? 
right . 
well the next thing you can do +/. [+ IN] 
is put that there . 
brilliant and I'll put a tiny bit of the flour that we've weighed out through your sieve . 
that's it . 
give it a shakie shakie jakey@wp . 
and then +/. [+ IN] 
+, this time we mix it in . 
no [/] no . 
please don't do that . 
no (be)cause apart from it not being very nice for the cakes if you get flour on your head hair wash in a minute . 
right . 
in a minute you can give this mixture another mix before we put the next egg in . 
I can't see . 
no [/] no [/] no . 
you can't , Thomas . 
can you imagine if you went to a party wearing a sieve instead of a party hat ? 
actually the beehive party fancy dress hat competition . 
let's do the next egg . 
do you wanna just beat this before we put the next egg in ? 
no . 
beating . 
beating it with a wooden spoon . 
mixing it . 
mixing and beating and stirring are all the same word . 
that's a mix and that's a beat and that's a stir . 
a mix . 
a beat and a stir . 
the beat is what Mummy does when she's making batter like a Yorkshire pudding pancakes .[+ PI] 
right . 
let's go . 
hello , shop man . 
could I have an egg from your shop , please ? 
oh , lovely . 
be careful .

well I only want one . 
that's brilliant . 
thank you . 
shall we put this other egg back now ?

that's it . 
now we must put the egg right out of the way . 
okay . 
thank_you . 
right . 
do you know what we've got to do now ? 
<we've got> [>] . 
tap it . 
but we've also got to write eggs on our shopping list (be)cause there's only one egg left now . 
we don't need the sieve yet , Thomas . 
just tap the egg . 
how many taps do you think it'll take ? 
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten . [+ R] 
oh . 
oops . 
we've got egg shell in again .

there's a very good date on them they're not out of date but they +... [+ IN] 
well just a minute we've got to get this egg shell out . 
what I think we might do . 
is xxx we might get that little thing that we hafta separate the eggs (be)cause I think we've made a little bit of a mess of that one .[+ PI] 
I do . 
yes . 
well I don't think that would help with separating the eggs . 
don't think the kitchen timer would help to separate eggs „ do you ? 
no . 
right [<] . 
get something else . 
how about this . 
look . 
a little tea strainer . 
to sift . 
right . 
right . 
had that done the trick ? 
right . 
now . 
oh no . 
never eat raw egg , darling . 
(be)cause it's not nice . 
egg's nice cooked . 
but not raw . 
(be)cause I'm just giving it a bit of a whiz round . 
oh yes . 
washing my hands . 
don't worry about that . 
when you're cooking things . 
baking . 
you've often got to stop and wash your hands „ haven't you ? 
(be)cause you can get sticky . 
that's right . 
sticky fingers . 
wicky fingers . 
there might be a little bit of egg shell in there . 
but we can't help it „ can we ? 
now are you putting your chef's hat back on ? 
why do you need the fire brigade , Thomas ? 
no [<] .

do you wanna give the egg a quick beat please ? 
brilliant .

<we don't want any> [//] yes . 
it's not a teaspoon . 
it's a big metal spoon . 
<we don't wanna> [/] <we don't wanna beat it anymore> [>] . 
well now look at that . 
we don't wanna beat it anymore . 
what do you think to that mixture ? 
is it nice and sweet ? 
now what we needta do is put the little paper cases +/. [+ IN] 
pardon ? 
putting your head on table ? 
no . 
would you like to come into this chair (be)cause this is a job you can do sitting down so your legs don't get tired . 
you can get some nice paper cases out of the cupboard . 
ooh and we can put them in the bun tin . 
little paper cases . 
little things that the bun &-um bun yeah bun cases . 
paper cases . 
sugar cases .

all the things in the kitchen that you can make music with . 
it's wonderful „ isn't it ? 
got pots and pans . 
paper cases . 
look we've got these . 
which have little Christmas look at those Christmas paper cases but those actually for sweets . 
they're far too small for what we want now . 
do you do this at nursery as well ? 
we hafta just put one +/. [+ IN]

how's that ? 
you're clever „ aren't you ? 
we've got mass „ have we ? 
we could go all round the town „ could we ? 
actually we've got some plain ones here but we haven't got very many fancy ones that's for when we next go to the shop . 
they're just plain pastry &-um paper cases . 
the ones that you use +/. [+ IN] 
well I think that you'll find that you've got quite a lot on there . 
when we go shopping we'll go and find some more fancy paper cases . 
we'll perhaps get ones with Christmas patterns on „ shall we ? 
(be)cause the only ones we've got with little Christmas patterns on now are little sweetie cases „ aren't they ? 
have we run out . 
there we are . 
we've got more than one in that one , look . 
and we've got more than one in that one . 
no there's three in that one , Thomas . 
you can take some out of there that'll fill those holes up . 
okay ? 
how's that ? 
that one (h)as got more than one I think . 
so has that one . 
there we are . 
if you've got any spare they can go back in the tub „ can't they ?

we've got some . 
what else do we needta put on the list ? 
ooh cheese . 
what's blose@c , Thomas ? 
I've written Purdie [/] Purdie food . 
(be)cause we always need Purdie food when we go shopping „ don't we ? 
we don't . 
we haven't got a dog . 
what for , Thomas ? 
oh . 
are your hands very clean now ? 
right . 
well now we get to the stage where we put teaspoonfuls +/. [+ N] 
+, of mixture into bun cases . 
there we are . 
we won't use that big spoon anymore . 
yes . 
you get to lick it at nursery as well ? 
does Miss Ashworth and Miss Landsdale let you lick the spoon ? 
you've made pizzas at Mrs Platford's have you made cakes at Mrs Platford's ? 
there should just be twelve on there . 
do you know what twelve [/] twelve cakes are called ? 
one dozen . 
do you wanna lick that spoon ? 
alright . 
I'll put it to one side then we'll use a teaspoon . 
are you happy sitting down or do you wanna stand up on your stool ? 
shall we do this together „ shall we ? 
okay . 
I don't think you can reach really „ can you ? 
well I think that's why if you stand up you could perhaps do a bit better . 
am I ? 
right . 
there we are . 
how many more have we got left to do now ? 
three . 
very good . 
right . 
I'm going to smooth around all the tops like that . 
dirty hands ? 
I thought little boys liked getting dirty hands . 
especially dirty hands where you can lick it off . 
we perhaps haven't put enough mixture in some of these but what we'll do when these have baked we'll do some more on another tray „ shall we ? 
would you like that ? 
no . 
not at the moment . 
not till we've done this (be)cause we might drop it . 
no . 
it needs to be flat on the table , Thomas please . 
flat on your finger . 
no . 
because we're going to end up dropping it on the floor and then what a mess . 
and you hafta tell Purdie that there aren't any buns for her birthday tea because we dropped them on the floor . 
Auntie Mabel and Pippin . 
when it's Pippin's birthday what does Auntie Mabel make for Pippin ? 
sausages . 
I think we needta get some nice food for Purdie tonight . 
perhaps some fresh fish or fresh piece of chicken . 
she likes those little crunchy bits „ doesn't she ? 
and we'll hafta put some candles on these buns . 
well actually we've made twelve cakes we'll hafta make another . 
&=laughs [>] . 
oh dear .

do you think we've enough to make six more buns (be)cause if we have that's eighteen buns and Purdie's eighteen . 
I think we have . 
<we won't [: won't]> [<] put them in the oven just yet . 
let's get another bun tray and put some more paper cases in another bun tray . 
right ? 
you could be . 
yes . 
you're right .

it's something and ring the bell but I can't get it . 
ring the bell and what the bell ?

lost the bell . 
right have you seen the bottom of this tray is blue and what's the bottom of that tray ? 
silver . 
it's red and black „ isn't it ?

be careful . 
<that's all I need> [<] . 
one more that's all we need . 
just one more , please and then we've made eighteen buns „ haven't we ? 
now you might get to use the spatula in a minute . 
put them there .

you bent down to pick the spatula up and banged your head „ didn't you ? 
could you get the spatula ? 
there you are . 
now . 
let me show you what we do with that spatula . 
it's a scraper . 
can you see now ? 
scrape it round and then look you get far more on there than you can ever get with a teaspoon . 
put that in the bun case and then you can do the rest of the bowl . 
that's it . 
it doesn't matter it's the end of the mixture now anyway „ isn't it ? 
well let's get the bowl scrapped first to make the buns then you can lick [/] lick out afterwards . 
(be)cause you know that we've just got one case now to fill so we need as much mix . 
you scrape it . 
no . 
you don't mix it like you did with the wooden spoon . 
scrape it . 
let me show you . 
<scrape scrape scrape> [/] scrape .
