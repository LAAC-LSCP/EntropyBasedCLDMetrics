I haven't asked if you could leave the table and no you can't yet .

what about your drink . 
do you want your drink ? 
what's the matter ? 
<not just> [<] yet (.) no .

there you are . 
there's a nice spoon for you . 
<just open one at> [//] wait till you've eaten that before you open this in case you don't want it , Thomas . 
0 [=! sighs] . 
I think I might have that piece of bread (.) that you've not eaten . 
I thought I won't make more than one sandwich because I won't eat it but actually I seem to be a little bit (.) hungry . 
that's right . 
that's what I mean . 
I needn't (.) &-uh have two pieces of bread . 
I'll just have the piece of bread you didn't eat . 
did you ? 
well you've had quite a lot because you've had the sausages and the bread . 
and one piece of apple . 
and a nice yoghurt . 
is it nice ? 
tasty . 
do you remember we bought that in Tesco on Thursday ? 
oh when was that , Thomas ? 
Thursday ? 
why was I annoyed with you on Thursday ? 
you were trying to go to get some sweets ? 
what ? 
you better not have done . 
<in the shop> [<] ? 
in the shop ? 
<I would be more than> [<] annoyed . 
would have been absolutely furious <if I'd known> [>] . 
in Tesco ? 
you ate a sweet in Tesco ? 
that's stealing , Thomas . 
no but <nothing (.) that's stealing> [>] . 
no I don't think he would , Thomas . 
xxx went out of my sight long enough for a security guard to ask you a question like that . [+ PI] 
seriously , Thomas (.) , if you take things (.) without paying for them (.) that is stealing . 
doesn't matter whether it's <one sheep> [//] one sweet (..) one grape (.) whatever it is (.) if you take something from a shop without paying (.) that is stealing . 
listen (.) I'm serious (.) if the security man had seen you (.) you could be in prison now . 
what sort of sweet did you take ? 
did anybody see you take it ? 
is that when you ran round the corner ? 
and is that when I shouted come here ? 
is that what you were doing ? 
you did it very quickly „ didn't you ? 
now listen (.) I didn't see you do that . 
I know you went round the corner and I shouted and you came back +... [+ IN] 
don't ever do that . 
I mean it , Thomas . 
do not do that . 
in future you hold my hand or your hold Daddy's hand or Nana and Grandad's hand . 
no you hold our hand anyway . 
I must see where you are . 
because listen (.) if you ran round that corner and you took a sweet without me seeing (.) somebody could have taken you without me seeing . 
couldn't they ? 
but please don't do things like that , Thomas . 
I know +... [+ IN] 
I know it's very tempting when all the sweets are there and you're feeling hungry (.) because it was quite late „ wasn't it ? 
because I picked you up from school (..) and then we went to Alphabet_Zoo . 
no it wasn't Alphabet_Zoo it was Wacky_Warehouse . 
and then we went to Tesco so I know it was near teatime . 
but you know (.) if you'd been so hungry you should have said to me I'm very hungry . 
and even then I couldn't have let you eat something with [//] before we paid it but at least I would have known (.) that you wanted something . 
don't [<] +... [+ IN] 
well you moaned on that you were hungry but you didn't say please can I have something now . 
please , Thomas , don't take things from shops . 
you're lucky this time that the security man didn't see you . 
but there are cameras (.) watching . 
there is , Thomas . 
I absolutely promise you there are cameras in shops watching . 
<<xxx no I'm> [<] not> [//] I am not joking now . 
<I know> [/] I know I joke with you (.) and I know I tease you about the police getting you and things (.) but seriously , Thomas , there are security men in shops <for that> [>] +... [+ IN ] 
Thomas , why do you think security men are there ? 
they're there in case there's any trouble and in case anybody takes something without paying for it . 
to keep you safe . 
to keep other shoppers safe from people who are stealing sweets and not paying for them . 
that's why things are so expensive in the shops , darling . 
because if people keep taking things without paying for them (.) the shop hasta make a +... [+ IN] 
well I was going to say a profit but you won't understand that (.) but +... [+ IN] 
the shop hasta cover its cost . 
well that means +... [+ IN] 
they sell things (.) at a price . 
and if everybody goes into the shop (.) and pays that price for things everything's fine . 
if a few people don't pay +... [+ IN] 
<then the shop> [>] +... [+ IN] 
oh [=! sighs] [<] . 
well I'm going to tell you this anyway . 
you hafta listen now . 
the shop hasta take enough pennies in its till (.) because the shop people hafta pay the people who (.) deliver their sweets . 
say [/] say you have a factory and you make sweets . 
right [<] . 
right (.) you hafta find money (.) to buy all the ingredients to make the sweets and to pay all the people who make <the sweets> [>] . 
then (.) the delivery men need paying as well . 
<and so> [<] when the shop decides (.) I wanna sell some sweets it's got to say to the factory how much are your sweets . 
and the factory will say such and such . 
well say twenty pounds . 
so the shopman pays twenty pounds . 
now the shopman must make sure that he has enough customers to give him enough money so that he gets his twenty pounds back . 
and if everybody pays there's no problem . 
but if a few people don't pay then he hasta put the price up really high for those that do pay . 
now how many times have we been out and you said “oh I want that” and I say “I'm sorry I've got no money” . 
because [<] things are expensive in shops , Thomas . 
but listen (.) just before you go (.) more to the point +... [+ IN] 
<you mustn't do it because you would> [<] +... [+ IN] 
if [/] if the security man or a policeman had seen you (.) in fact if a security man had seen you he might have asked the police to come . 
now you imagine spending a night without Mummy in a police station . 
all because you'd taken one sweet . 
it doesn't matter &whe [/] whether it's one sweet (.) five sweets (.) a toy (.) whatever it is (.) you never (.) ever take anything <from a shop> [>] . 
alright ? 
I'm sorry to go on +... [+ IN] 
<please don't wander off> [>] . 
<you've got> [<] crumbs all over [>] . 
no [<] . 
well sit back and I'll get you another yoghurt . 
which color would you like ? 
right (.) now you just <take on board> [>] +... [+ IN] 
you take on board please what I've just said . 
because (.) <I know it's boring> [>] +... [+ IN] 
+, but it's serious , Thomas . 
and you +... [+ IN] 
Mister_Righteous [<] who's sposta be so clever and so good +... [+ IN] 
and I find out you've been pinching sweets ! 
<oh by> [<] gum . 
mhm . 
there you are . 
orange [>] . 
just one orange ? 
whoops (.) quick [/] quick . 
no you're not having any more after that . 
no . 
because it's quite enough . 
quite enough for one day . 
<they're only> [>] very tiny actually „ aren't they „ those ? 
xxx [<] . 
well could you eat that one first please before you get another one . 
legs down . 
come on . 
if you're still eating (.) you're at the table properly . 
thank you . 
well four cost me ninety nine pence . 
and ninety nine pence is a penny less than a pound . 
one [//] you know that [//] one of those coins ? 
those thick coins ? 
the round ones ? 
small [>] +... [+ IN] 
+, that say one pound . 
if you gave a shopkeeper one of those +... [+ IN] 
that's if you pay for it , Thomas . 
if you gave the shopkeeper one of those coins and handed them (.) the fromage_frais@s:fra (.) they would give you one penny +//. [+ IN] 
that's the [/] the brown coins (.) the smallest brown coin . 
+, they'd give you one of those back . 
one penny change . 
because ninety nine pence [>] +... [+ IN] 
ninety nine pence in a penny is a pound . 
no . 
yeah (.) I don't think the people in the shop would like toy money . 
well because it's not real money „ is it ? 
mhm . 
yeah (.) but this is the thing , Thomas . 
I know sometimes you think I'm mean when (.) I say Mummy hasn't got any money but (..) Mummy hasta go out to work (.) Daddy hasta go out to work . 
when you work +... [+ IN] 
if you've done a good day's work (.) your boss says well done (.) here's some pennies . 
and then I hafta make those pennies last to pay for the house (.) the electricity (.) the water (.) treats (.) toys (.) sweets . 
all sorts of things . 
and when the money runs out (.) that's it . 
I hafta go and do some more work . 
<you know> [?] [//] there's [/] there's a saying (.) money doesn't grow on trees . 
and it doesn't . 
<you have> [<] to work for money . 
and only the people with money can buy things . 
well I wish it could grow on trees . 
but it doesn't . 
you hafta work hard for money . 
and you can only buy things when you have enough money . 
which is why many [/] many times we see things and I think oh I'd like that or I'd like to buy that for Thomas but I can't because if there aren't enough pennies in my pocket I can't do it . 
<and if you> [<] +... [+ IN] 
well Purdie knows this because I've spoken to Purdie about it before . 
and if you haven't got enough pennies in your purse or your pocket or your wallet to buy things then you can't have them because taking things without paying [>] +... [+ IN] 
well that's it you see . 
so you couldn't have it „ could you ? 
now if you'd taken ten p@l and it was nine p@l you could have it and get a penny change . 
that's fine . 
you give them three pounds and they give you a pound change . 
or you'd be better just giving them two pounds and keeping a pound to yourself . 
but no this is it , Thomas . 
you can only buy what you can afford and if you can't afford it you hafta leave it on the shelf because people who take things when they can't afford to pay it end up in prison . 
okay ? 
people like you . 
it doesn't matter who you are . 
if you take things without paying for it (.) that's where you end up . 
no in a police cell . 
<and the policeman would be very> [<] very cross with you . 
they wouldn't be like they are now . 
when you see the policeman they say hello , son , how are you ? 
they'd say naughty boy in the cell ! 
and they'd klonk@o the door . 
and that would be it and you wouldn't see me . 
yes . 
think on . 
end of lecture . 
<oh , Thomas > [<] . 
yes alright . 
but Mummy always does pay , Thomas , because it's just not worth the risk „ is it ? 
okay ? 
xxx . 
are you alright ? 
meow . 
<right shall I> [<] tell you a little story now , Thomas ? 
when I was a little girl +... [+ IN] 
+, I went shopping in York with Nana_Bealby and we went to a shop called Woolworths . 
and you know Woolworths in Stockport ? 
the toy shop . 
remember [<] the toys ? 
I went in there (..) and we were walking along and on the floor (..) I saw a tiny bit of metal . 
it was only a little thing . 
a tiny thing . 
and I picked it up and thought (.) oh I like the look of that . 
and I had a dolls house (..) and in my dolls house I had all sorts of things like (.) bedroom furniture (.) wardrobes and beds and dressing table and things like that . 
and this little piece of silver that stood like that +//. [+ IN] 
it was almost like &-um (.) you know the letter a@l ? 
a triangle ? 
it was almost like that but it was all made of metal . 
ever so tiny . 
and it was so bright ! 
I could see my face in it and I though oh [=! gasps] that would make a superb mirror for one of the dressing tables in my dolls house . 
so I picked it up . 
and I was about to put it in my pocket (.) and Grandma_Beably saw me and she went absolutely mad ! 
and do you know what it was ? 
in those days +//. [+ IN] 
you know how now you have little stickers on everything ? 
a man goes round with his sticker gun and all the prices are put on the goods ? 
well in those days +//. [+ IN] 
xxx it happens a lot now as well . [+ PI] 
they useta have these little (.) &-um (.) sort of price tags are the only way I can describe them (.) above the [/] the goods . 
say I was selling that +... [+ IN] 
above it would be a little piece of metal (.) and the shopkeeper would put the price on the metal . 
and these little metal things useta slide along the bar (.) and they would show all the shoppers the prices . 
and I didn't realize but what I'd picked up was one of these little metal bars . 
so I thought (.) oh it's just a bit of [/] bit of something on the floor (.) nobody wants it . 
I'll take that home for my doll's house (.) but Nana_Bealby made me put it back because it did belong to somebody . 
it belonged to the shop . 
and she made me understand . 
I don't know what she's said to me but I've never forgotten it . 
she made me understand from a very early age that (.) you don't take things . 
because even if you think it's nothing (.) if it's in <a shop> [>] it belongs to the shop . 
oh if somebody gives you it in the shop +//. [+ IN] 
I mean occasionally we go to shops +... [+ IN] 
well when we went to Mrs_Sweets shop (.) do you remember she said oh have that and she gave you the odd sweet . 
that's totally different . 
usually because you've been a good boy . 
they don't give naughty boys +... [+ IN] 
you know rowdy boys (.) sweets . 
but you never take anything . 
<even if> [>] +... [+ IN] 
<what is it> [>] ? 
yeah . 
I think what we'll do next time we go shopping +... [+ IN] 
you know the little toy purse that we brought from Spain ? 
well it's not a toy purse (.) it's a real purse that we brought from Spain but you use it with your play shop . 
when we next go shopping (.) we'll put some proper money in there . 
and when we go to a shop and buy something (.) you can pay . 
and then you can see how much change you get . 
because at the moment you always come to the till with me and we always say please and thank you . 
always [/] always pay for things , sweetheart . 
yeah ? 
you can if you get any change . 
right . 
I love you . 
I don't want you in prison . 
what shall we play ? 
how about (.) policemen catching naughty boys ? 
where's the naughty boy ? 
Purdie [<] ? 
no . 
oh [<] right (.) well let's get our hands washed and finish lunch . 
xxx [<] . 
why ? 
oh well . 
&d [//] don't yet because we wanna go out and post the letter now . 
no let's post our <letter and then perhaps> [>] +... [+ IN] 
well we can play it when we go to the post box . 
you could put your police helmet on to go to the post box if you like . 
&-uh (.) no . 
I could be the naughty boy and you could hold my hand as if you're arresting me . 
okay [>] ? 
<well I> [//] oh I'm not going to the post box with handcuffs on , Thomas . 
that's taking it too far . 
you'd probably end up posting me . 
stop smacking my bum . 
you messpot . 
not really .
