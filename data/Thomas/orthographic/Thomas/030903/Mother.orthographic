you've had an ear infection and I think it's making you shout all the time now . 
which bread would you like for your sandwich ? 
that or this . 
the white one ? 
not the brown one ? 
the fire engine has bumped into the buffers ? 
could it not see them there ? 
he left them there so that other people wouldn't go too near the fire ? 
and then he forgot they were there and bumped into them himself (.) with his fire engine . 
that's a bit strange „ isn't it ? 
oh_gosh , he has „ hasn't he ? 
fireman , don't forget your hose . 
what did you say ? 
good grief ? 
oh . 
would the fireman like a jam sandwich ?

and when you're at nursery at Miss Lansdale's you have a real fire helmet „ don't you ? 
two fireman's helmets . 
proper ones . 
and they say “Durham fire” . 
whatever it is they say on them . 
“Durham county fire service” I think they say „ don't they ? 
can't read it ? 
no . 
you can't . 
but that's what they say on them . 
oh_gosh . 
I forgot „ didn't I ? 
I was xxx at the time and you asked me to look at some dials . [+ I] 
never mind . 
I'm sure [//] well .

hopefully he (h)as got his mobile phone with him and I can ring him up . 
0 [=! ringing noises] . 
hello ? 
is that Fireman_Sam ? 
Fireman_Sam , I'm terribly sorry but you left your hose pipe there and it's just lying in the road .

or do you think she (h)as gone back to Greece for Christmas ? 
did she really ? 
is that what she said to you ? 
when she comes back she'll bring cakes ? 
&=laughs . 
you remember that about her „ have you ? 
what else do you remember about Dimitra ?

yes . 
you could be fire officer Steel and I could be a fireman . 
and then what ? 
hm . 
we could do . 
yes . 
you're sniffing a lot . 
you sound like you've got a cold . 
we could play with the garage that Santa brought you . 
you got lots_of nice things „ didn't you ? 
what was your favorite toy ? 
what was your favorite toy ? 
a fire engine ? 
that wasn't a Christmas present . 
oh . 
I know . 
that one . 
do you mean a fire station ? 
that wasn't a Christmas present though „ was it ? 
you've had that a long time the big fire engine . 
but Auntie Tricia bought you the little S O S station „ didn't she ? 
it has a police car . 
a fire engine and an ambulance in it and that makes all sorts of sounds „ doesn't it ? 
it doesn't make any sounds like that at all . 
I think that's sposta be the sound of the engines roaring as they set off to fight a fire . 
it doesn't bang . 
it just makes a noise like a motor starting up . 
press your electric thumb ? 
what does it do ? 
just a second . 
press your electric thumb . 
oh_gosh . 
that's scary . 
<what's the noise> [//] where's the noise coming from ? 
a ghost ? 
gosh . 
that's a noisy ghost . 
I press that electric thumb . 
right . 
and what's that ? 
an alarm clock ? 
Fireman_Sam's alarm clock or Postman_Pat's alarm clock ? 
are the cornflakes nice , Thomas ? 
pardon ? 
you got them down your dressing gown „ have you ? 
ooh . 
don't worry about it . 
would you like me to wipe your nose so you're not sniffing all the time ? 
Thomas ? 
oh dear . 
poor little boy . 
you've been really poorly this Christmas „ haven't you ? 
bit better now though „ aren't you ? 
are you better now ? 
Thomas ? 
yes . 
so what have you got to tell me today ? 
nothing ? 
you not talking ? 
don't just shake your head . 
why aren't you talking to me ? 
you don't care ? 
oh . 
fair enough . 
why won't you look at me ? 
(be)cause I don't wanna . 
don't you ? 
oh dear . 
don't keep sniffing Thomas , please . 
oh , come on . 
you're just doing it now . 
no . 
oh , I'm not talking to a little boy that's sniffing . 
I know you can't help it but some of it you're putting on . 
what other presents did you get ? 
Mummy and Daddy bought you that truck „ didn't we ? 
like you have at the beehive . 
do you like that ? 
are you ? 
too busy eating an apple ? 
I was just about to say you're eating cornflakes . 
there is an apple on the table for you . 
oh , right . 
okay . 
you think you would like some more cornflakes ? 
pardon ? 
you [*] go to see your Mummy in a minute . 
you're pretending you're still in Spain ? 
are you missing Mummy in Spain ? 
hello . 
oh , Thomas . 
did you have a nice holiday , sweetheart ? 
oh , I missed you . 
did you miss Mummy ? 
oh . 
poor Mummy . 
did you not miss me at all ? 
but you only stayed away one day „ haven't you ? 
you've come back to Mummy . 
you did miss me really „ didn't you ? 
mhm . 
and what did you do while you were in Spain ? 
just eating ? 
swimming in the pool ? 
lily pads ? 
did you ? 
that sounds exciting . 
and what did you eat while you were in Spain ? 
was it ? 
yes . 
orange ? 
red ? 
what was it ? 
was it blue ? 
I seem to think that when we were in Spain that we had an ice lolly every evening and they were all different colors . 
do you remember those long lollies on the sticks ? 
they had the colors of the rainbow „ weren't they ? 
perhaps not all the colors of the rainbow they maybe only had five colors rather than seven but they were nice „ weren't they ? 
well . 
for being a very good boy there's a little suitcase packed with something special for your breakfast . 
what is it ? 
an apple . 
how do you think Apple is ? 
our friend Apple ? 
apples grow on apple trees . 
yes . 
they do . 
I was meaning our friend Jeannine . 
you call her Apple „ don't you ? 
do you think she's alright ? 
does that taste nice ? 
would you like the rest of these , Thomas ? 
chocolate coins . 
the apples are chocolate coins . 
like you had at Christmas . 
who brought you those ? 
Santa ? 
did you find a little bag of chocolate coins in your stocking ? 
that's very exciting [>] . 
ooh . 
yes . 
one more bag of chocolate coins . 
that's nice . 
look , sorry but it looks like a piece of apple to me . 
will , won't it ? 
if you put the juice on top of the box it will stop it opening . 
did you have a nice sleep ? 
Mummy slept in your bed last night with you „ didn't she ? 
I think we were both very tired „ weren't we ? 
I remember reading you a story and cuddling up to you and that was it . 
the next thing <I knew> [>] it was this morning and Purdie was crying because she wanted to come out . 
and Daddy must've fallen asleep as well (be)cause when I came downstairs one of the doors wasn't locked . 
one of the doors wasn't locked last night . 
well Daddy must've gone to bed and thought that I'd get up like I normally do and I didn't do . 
I fell asleep and the television wasn't turned on but the stand by button was still switched on . 
when he was watching buss ? 
why did you say when he was watching buss ? 
was there something on television about buss ? 
excuse me . 
on the news ? 
what did it say about buss ? 
when you were a little boy you useta love buss . 
you still quite like buss „ don't you ? 
blue bus ? 
you do . 
yes . 
oh no . 
you don't . 
when you were little and you useta see red buss you useta say “Po bus” but you didn't ever say any of the other Teletubbies . 
we have a lot of blue buss here „ don't we ? 
Magic buss and you useta say blue bus . 
you still say “blue bus” . 
and the easy access buss the ones that we useta use when you were still in a push chair . 
and we get the number forty two quite a lot and the one seven one and the fifty . 
forty two . 
fifty and the one seven one . 
those are our main buss „ aren't they ? 
the three seventy goes to Stockport but we don't very often get that . 
but when you were a lot younger . 
we don't get it now . 
but the news after the main news at six o'clock . 
when the local news came on at six thirty (.) they useta have different scenes of Manchester while the music was playing . 
hm . 
oh really ? 
so a blue truck and a blue bus behind it ? 
they were all blue . 
where was that ? 
where was it ? 
oh , on the news . 
oh right . 
but when the theme tune useta come on for north west news there useta be a picture of a tram driving through Manchester and you useta rush to the television and say <a bus a bus a bus> [/] a bus@q . 
and when the music was playing you useta get so excited . 
+" where's the bus ? 
+" where's the bus ? 
waiting for it to come on . 
<it was actually> [//] it wasn't a bus and it wasn't a train . 
it was a tram . 
but you useta get terribly excited . 
I think we've got you on video asking where the bus is . 
do you remember that ? 
and then not long afterwards they changed the music and the title and the pictures rather . 
so north west tonight is still on and they still have a little tune and they still have scenes but not the ones you useta +/. [+ N] 
oh . 
I would imagine there's one quarter . 
I would imagine Mummy (h)as cut the apple in half . 
we had two halfs and she (h)as cut each half into quarters . 
we had four quarters and I think you had two quarters last night and you've just eaten one quarter now . 
I would imagine there's one quarter left . 
let's have a look and see if I'm right . 
what do you think ? 
you think I'm right ? 
oh . 
very good . 
look at that . 
one quarter . 
it was a very big apple that actually „ wasn't it ? 
a huge apple (be)cause that quarter of an apple is like most [/] most apples when they are cut in half . 
a cheeky old bird snapped it off ? 
what sort of bird was it ? 
a magpie ? 
come back here , Magpie with my piece of apple for my little boy . 
come back please . 
straight away . 
come back straight away please , apple . 
has he gone over the hills and far away ? 
where the Teletubbies like to play . 
his beard . 
his beak . 
oh_gosh . 
no . 
it's not . 
it's over there where the magpie dropped it . 
what were we saying yesterday about the magpies ? 
one for sorrow . 
two for +/. [+ N] 
joy . 
good boy . 
three for a girl . 
four for a +/. [+ N] 
+, a boy . 
are you not going to eat this sandwich ? 
this piece of apple ? 
no . 
sit where you are please . 
what about the apple ? 
no . 
sit still please . 
until I finish this . 
will you sit still please , Thomas . 
have you had enough to eat ? 
are you sure ? 
do you want that little sweetie now ? 
<do you> [<] want that sweetie ? 
no . 
you sit still , Thomas please . 
good . 
yes ? 
no . 
you haven't . 
you put it in the little container that the apple was in . 
well shake it and let me hear . 
alright . 
I'll try not to . 
it's a bit stiff . 
hm . 
it's empty . 
where's [//] have you dropped it in your mouth ? 
must be in your hand then . 
still in your hand ? 
let's have a look . 
what about the left hand ? 
what about +... [+ N] 
I can see it in the right hand . 
lift both your hands up . 
Thomas , do not leave the table please . 
I haven't said you can . 
go back . 
Thomas , back to the table please . 
ah . 
is it in your mouth now ? 
very good . 
it'll do you a lot of good that little sweet . 
we've got to try and get you a well boy again „ haven't we ? 
(be)cause you've missed out a lot this Christmas but we've had a nice time before Christmas (be)cause you went to all sorts of partys and different things „ didn't you ? 
you're a very busy boy . 
you've done an awful lot of things . 
I think possibly you got so tired and run down . 
what sort of things did we do before Christmas ? 
the sweetie shop ? 
well . 
come on . 
come and sit on my knee and tell me . 
ooh . 
well . 
I tell you what you did do with Daddy just before Christmas . 
you and Daddy went to Didsbury one Saturday morning and you went into the car [//] sweetie shop with a card that Daddy had made on his computer specially for the lady in the +/. [+ N] 
in the sweetie shop . 
yes . 
we call her Mrs sweet shop „ don't we ? 
I don't know , Thomas . 
I wasn't there . 
what did Daddy buy for you to eat ? 
yes . 
and I know what happened in that sweetie shop . 
when Mummy takes you in that sweetie shop we go in once a week sometimes twice a week but one day a week after you've been to Mrs Platford's nursery in Didsbury we go to the sweet shop and Mummy spends between about five and seven pence on you . 
I think the most expensive I've ever (.) most expensive . 
I mean the most expensive time was when I spent twelve pence and that was when we had Daniel with us so I was buying for two . 
so you get very very few sweets from me (be)cause I'm trying to look after your teeth (.) and I buy little jelly snakes that cost a penny each . 
fairly [/] fairly long . 
but they're not very big . 
I buy little jelly snakes and occasionally I'll buy a lollipop as well . 
a little chewy lolly . 
now this particular day you came home with three absolutely huge jelly snakes that had cost twenty five pence each because when you went in the sweet shop with Daddy , what did you tell Daddy ? 
you said “Mummy , buys those” . 
and you pointed to huge snakes that I have never ever let you have . 
and Daddy believed you and he didn't just buy one . 
he bought three . 
and I think the sweet shop lady must've thought it was Christmas literally . 
I couldn't believe it . 
and you came home with a huge jelly snake . 
but I know we saved the other two for another day „ didn't we ? 
and then one day you'd been in the car with Daddy and you came back (.) and you were just about to eat the snake when you came home and you were frightened about what I would say and you pushed it all in your mouth and then you made yourself choke „ didn't you ? 
what other sweeties do you like ? 
hm . 
big long what ? 
liquorice ? 
you like the reddy liquorice „ don't you ? 
the red liquorice and those things that look like boots . 
boot laces . 
shoe laces . 
but yes . 
you definitely conned Daddy that day . 
Mummy buys these . 
Mummy doesn't <buy those > [>] . 
I notice the <sweet shop lady kept quiet as well > [>] . 
the sweet shop lady didn't let on either „ did she ? 
hm ? 
yeah . 
right . 
yours next . 
your hand on top of mine . 
that's it . 
right . 
one for the bottom . 
on top of mine . 
right . 
that's it . 
you can always take one from the bottom and put it on the top . 
that's it . 
building a big stack „ aren't we ? 
there's a name for this game +/. [+ N] 
+, but I don't know what it is . 
your hand . 
my hand . 
your hand . 
my hand . 
then the one from the bottom comes up to the top . 
no . 
no . 
don't poke me . 
that's not nice . 
it hurts . 
so before Christmas we went to a +/. [+ N] 
well we know about the sweet shop but there were all sorts of things going on . 
you were in a nativity play „ weren't you ? 
at Mrs Platford's . 
what part did you play at the nativity play ? 
you weren't a fire engine . 
no . 
you were a shepherd . 
and then +/. [+ N] 
you had your +//. [+ N] 
no . 
come on . 
sit still or go back to the table , please . 
you were a shepherd „ weren't you in the nativity play ? 
and you had a little sing song a nursery „ didn't you ? 
and what did you sing ? 
sing a song of shepherds ? 
ooh . 
you sang all sorts of things . 
jingle bells and when Santa got stuck up the chimney „ didn't you ? 
lots_of things . 
and we went to Molly's party „ didn't we ? 
do you remember that ? 
we went to a disco in Glossop „ didn't we ? 
Thomas , be careful [>] . 
is there ? 
on Pigeon_Street ? 
on the television ? 
there's a man called Glossop is there ? 
we went to Glossop on the train . 
do you remember ? 
and it was very cold „ wasn't it ? 
it wasn't as cold as last year . 
(be)cause last year when we went to Glossop there was actually snow on the ground . 
there wasn't this time „ was there ? 
<no no> [/] no . 
and what happened at Molly's party ? 
it was a disco „ wasn't it ? 
<(be)cause Molly> [//] was Molly five or six ? 
I can't remember now . 
one two three four five . [+ R] 
once I caught a shark one day ? 
not “a fish alive” ? 
so I really can't remember whether Molly was five or six but she had a little birthday disco and we don't know many people there „ do we ? 
but we see her usually once or twice a year and I tell you what you enjoyed playing . 
musical chairs . 
do you remember where there was that row of chairs ? 
and you were all running around the chairs and then one was taken away ? 
you did very well actually . 
you stayed quite a long time (be)cause most of those girls are much bigger than you (.) and there was pass the parcel „ wasn't there ? 
you didn't win the main prize but you had a little bar of chocolate or something . 
everybody had a +/. [+ N] 
was it a lolly ? 
I was going to say everybody had [/] had something „ didn't they ? 
and it was nice food „ wasn't it ? 
the little boy sitting next to you didn't like his little crisp biscuits „ did he ? 
do you remember the little cheesy biscuits and cheesy whatsits and crisps ? 
he left those „ didn't he ? 
mhm . 
yes . 
and then we came back on the train „ didn't we ? 
but the train had been canceled „ hadn't it ? 
we got back from Glossop with no problems then we went straight from the party we were walking back from the train station and then Mummy saw that shop Woolworths and I wanted to go and buy some little gold coins „ didn't I ? 
you know the little chocolate coins ? 
for Sumara and her sisters and we tried all over the place and we tried Woolworths in Glossop and the assistant said “oh , we do have some” . 
but when she went to look she said “I'm sorry” . 
“we've sold out” „ didn't she ? 
we had a little look at the toys in that shop „ didn't we ? 
do you remember ? 
and then we walked to the train station . 
I seem to remember you were walking up and down that low wall waiting for the train . 
there was a very low wall at the side of the platform and you were walking up and down while we were waiting for the train to come and it was cold and dark „ wasn't it ? 
then the train came and we got on it . 
did we go backwards ? 
pardon ? 
was there ? 
oh that's right . 
yes . 
the train pulled into the station . 
you're quite right (.) and we got on it an instead of it going straight ahead it hadta go backwards „ didn't it ? 
(be)cause it was a dead end at Glossop . 
we hadta go back and then join another line . 
and when we got into Piccadilly station it was busy that night „ wasn't it ? 
we were going to get the train from Piccadilly to Burnage and then walk from Burnage station home (.) but the train was canceled wasn't it ? 
so what did we do instead ? 
does it ? 
well it usually means that something (h)as happened . 
that the driver (h)as not turned up or the train's poorly . 
yes . 
so we got in a taxi „ didn't we ? 
it was quite a long way home from Piccadilly station . 
yes . 
that was the Wednesday before Christmas „ wasn't it ? 
yes ? 
what's that coming round the bend ? 
big bedroom window . 
oh . 
a fire engine again . 
gosh , he's a very shiny fire engine . 
he looks like a new one to me . 
is he quite a new fire engine ? 
don't shout , Thomas . 
is there ? 
why are you putting on a silly voice ? 
it's very hard to hear what you're saying . 
what did you say ? 
we'll get you down in two ticks ? 
can I have a little treat ? 
you're giving me a hose pipe ? 
oh . 
that's nice . 
right . 
just thought about that party in Glossop , Thomas . 
<well I've a feeling that we went> [//] I think you went to nursery that day . 
you (h)ad had your nursery sing a long and then I think you (h)ad had your nativity play at Mrs Platford's on Tuesday . 
possibly Tuesday . 
then on Wednesday you went to nursery as usual and then I picked you up (.) and we went to Glossop on the train and we came home +/. [+ N] 
+, and then the following day was the last day at nursery . 
went to Molly's party on the Wednesday and the last day of nursery was a Thursday and you got out of bed [>] . 
yes ? 
+, Thursday morning and you were very tired and we walked into nursery and you started to cry and you went for a cuddle with Miss Ashworth and I said to her “you're very tired today” . 
you were so tired after that disco „ weren't you ? 
and then that was the last day of nursery on Thursday [>] . 
yes . 
what did he skid on ? 
the ice ? 
goodness me . 
oh that's a good skid . 
and then do you know what we did the day after you finished nursery ? 
finished nursery on the Thursday . 
on the Friday we went on the bus to Victoria Park and we delivered Christmas cards to places where Mummy useta work „ didn't we ? 
do you remember Goldson Hall ? 
that big place that looks like a castle ? 
the one next to Eileen's house ? 
are they ? 
oh . 
find your slippers . 
and then we walked all the way from Victoria Park to Rusholme and we missed a bus . 
do you remember why we missed a bus ? 
we waited for a bus and just as one came along what was coming in the opposite direction ? 
a fire engine and you wanted to look at the fire engine so we actually didn't get on the bus . 
we let the bus go while you looked at the fire engine and we waited a long time for another bus and when it came we got on the bus to Rusholme and we went to Alan Hall where Daddy works and we got off there and what happened when we got there ? 
I don't think he (h)ad gone to John Lewis but he was out of the office „ wasn't he ? 
so then as a little treat we walked from Alan Hall through Fallowfield to +/. [+ N] 
no . 
it wasn't the sweet shop . 
where was it ? 
no . 
it was to McDonald's „ wasn't it ? 
had lunch at McDonald's and then we went to the payphone outside of McDonald's to try and tell him we were there but he still wasn't about and then we got the bus from McDonald's to Didsbury and then we did some shopping in Didsbury and when we got home he was here . 
Daddy was already home „ wasn't he ? 
we had a lovely day „ didn't we ? 
then not many days after that you were poorly . 
Saturday you were okay . 
Sunday you were okay . 
that was Christmas eve . 
you started being very tired and by Christmas day you were a poorly boy . 
Margaret bought you this little fire engine „ didn't she ? 
oh . 
I see . 
they make the hose work „ do they ? 
you attach it . 
you attach it onto the valve . 
press the button then it goes „ does it ? 
that's very good . 
oh , I wouldn't ever squirt it at nobody . 
no . 
never do that . 
two of them ? 
right . 
just let me hold it straight . 
there we are . 
fire's out . 
let's play fire fighters ? 
well just a second . 
I think we needta have a little wipe down after breakfast „ don't we ? 
you need signs „ do you ? 
well would you like to just bring some things in this side of the room please , Thomas . 
oh right . 
you're watching yourself in a stainless waste paper bin „ are you ? 
in the kitchen bin . 
I'm a nice bunch of flowers „ am I ? 
hm . 
is it ? 
right . 
yes . 
they're closed . 
oh , the firemen again . 
do you ? 
open them on the floor , please . 
gosh . 
all the fire fighters . 
we'll play in here , darling . 
just for a few minutes , please . 
put it on the floor . 
that's a good boy . 
it makes a bit of a bang and crash „ doesn't it ? 
when the box is emptied on the floor . 
that's right . 
where's the little container ? 
that's it . 
it looks like a waste bin's on fire „ doesn't it ? 
I don't think you open it . 
I think the flames just sit on top . 
that's right . 
perhaps the other way . 
and then I think the fireman comes and squirts the flames with his hose (.) and then +/. [+ N] 
+, the flames go out „ don't they ? 
yes . 
yes . 
let's have a look . 
has it still got sticky tape on ? 
perhaps [//] oh well , he hasn't now . 
it (h)as perhaps got on when he's doing something else . 
either that or we didn't unwrap it properly at the time . 
that was the trouble with you not being well (be)cause Christmas eve you started being very tired and Christmas day morning you opened your presents and then went to sleep and lunchtime on Christmas day you were crying . 
you didn't want your lunch „ did you ? 
and all Boxing day and the next two days . 
you had a very high temperature . 
you didn't want anything to eat . 
and then we went to the doctor and it was an ear infection „ wasn't it ?
