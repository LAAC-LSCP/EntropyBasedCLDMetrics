this is a box we've got „ isn't it ? 
and <you've got> [//] they look almost like cheesy whatsits „ don't they „ but they [//] instead of <yellow colored> [>] like cheesy whatsit they're cream colored .

xxx from this box . [+ PI] 
it's a sort of polystyrene xxx . [+ PI] 
but that other one +... [+ IN]

that other one looked a bit damaged though . 
there was sort of sticky stuff from the xxx „ wasn't there ? [+ PI] 
<smells like a> [>] burnt meringue .

please . 
yes [?] . 
yes . 
with your fingernail as well . 
it's one of these magic slates that we're using „ isn't it „ to write with . 
no you're getting a little bit confused with the letters [>] . 
b@l and d@l . 
no that's p@l . 
xxx b@l d@l and p@l . [+ PI] 
xxx d@l . [+ PI] 
d@l . 
b@l and d@l . 
that's right . 
right (.) well the [/] the trick is learning +//. [+ IN] 
now are you going to sit next to me ? 
just get your little stool (..) please . 
the trick is working out which is d@l and which is b@l [?] . 
we won't bother with p@l now <we'll just> [/] we'll just deal with d@l and b@l [?] . 
right . 
no you imagine all that is in a line , Thomas . 
all that is from a@l right through to z@l in a line . 
now in the alphabet if you say a@l b@l c@l d@l +... [+ IN] 
<mhm hm:> [<] . 
right xxx please , Thomas . [+ PI] 
will you just <listen to what> [>] I was saying ? 
this is concentration . 
this is learning to do +//. [+ IN] 
why I always tell your Daddy off for doing this because your Daddy can only do one job at a time and I lots . 
but +... [+ IN] 
what I want you to do now +... [+ IN] 
<is not> [<] to do lots_of jobs just to concentrate on one job . 
and the one job is learning b@l and d@l . 
so don't look at anything else (.) we'll play in a minute . 
you imagine all the letters in a line . 
now if we say a@l b@l c@l d@l . 
very good . 
do you wanna say that again ? 
no ? 
okay . 
oh [!] is it not raining „ is it ? 
is it raining ? 
no I don't think so . 
it's just I've got some washing out . 
I think it possibly is you know . 
I think it might be . 
let me just see if there's any drops of water on the path . 
perhaps it's just a little bit of dirt . 
sounded like raindrops „ didn't it ? 
right (.) so you imagine <all the letters> [>] in a line , Thomas . 
now b@l +... [+ IN] 
does b@l come before d@l if you say all +//. [+ IN] 
you say [>] +... [+ IN] 
no [>] . 
oh no [/] no . 
if you're doing a@l b@l c@l d@l +... [+ IN] 
if you're doing a@l b@l c@l d@l <does b@l> [>] come before d@l ? 
does b@l come before d@l ? 
no ? 
oh . 
well you just say it again . 
<just a> [/] just a little xxx [>] . [+ PI] 
yes .

right (.) so what came first ? 
the b@l or the d@l ? 
yeah but after a@l what came +... [+ IN] 
<no &af> [<] +... [+ IN] 
right [<] . 
so if you imagine all the letters in a line +... [+ IN] 
okay . 
you're going to come across a b@l . 
now what can you see on that b@l ? 
an up . 
now the up thing +//. [+ IN] 
you imagine walking into a line of letters +... [+ IN] 
but you just step over the a@l . 
but you bump into the b@l . 
that's what the b@l stands for . 
I bumped into b@l . 
what's the bit that you bumped into ? 
that bit sticking up there . 
so you remember a line of letters <and the very> [>] first thing you step over the a@l and the next thing you bump into that barrier . 
b@l for bump . 
b@l for barrier . 
that's your b@l . 
now further along the alphabet you step over the c@l because the c@l is little like a@l . 
it's got no bits sticking up . 
and then bother me (.) you bump into the d@l . 
the d@l . 
and the bit you bump into is [>] +... [+ IN] 
is that one . 
so can you remember [>] +... [+ IN] 
yeah . 
can you think +//. [+ IN] 
do you think you can remember that ? 
you're walking along and you bump into that barrier . 
that's b@l . 
so the b@l +... [+ IN] 
you recognize b@l because it's got the barrier first and then the circle . 
okay a barrier first and then a circle . 
you step over the c@l and then you come to the d@l and you're doing really nicely . 
so you get over that roundy bit and the you bump into d@l . 
what can we call that danger sign ? 
d@l for danger ? 
what [/] what +... [+ IN] 
no but we [>] +... [+ IN] 
<oh yes> [?] .

it's [?] [<] something xxx [>] . [+ PI] 
diver . 
but something stops you . 
<and it start> [>] +... [+ IN] 
right . 
a diver's fall [?] . 
but either the b@l has the barrier first . 
the d@l has the barrier at the end . 
so <you stepped over that> [>] and you bump into that and it +//. [+ IN] 
ow [!] danger . 
d@l for danger . 
now what's that little rhyme that we made up ? 
we were drawing a bed „ weren't we ? 
we've got a little bed (.) made up of (..) b@l at the beginning and d@l (..) at the end . 
okay ? 
<b@l has the barrier here> [=! singing] . 
<d@l has the barrier there> [=! singing] . 
<put them all to bed together with a> [=! singing] +... [+ IN] 
<e@l (..) in the middle> [=! singing] . 
<what do you have> [=! singing] ?

you imagine a bed . 
that's your nice bed . 
okay [>] . 
<and there you are> [>] . 
at the pillow end you've got the b@l . 
and at the bottom end you've got the d@l .

so we found the very same toy so we bought one . 
they had a ladybird and a wooden dog „ didn't they ? 
and we bought the ladybird one . 
I keep thinking actually , Thomas , that would make a nice present for either Abigail or Sarah .

did you not notice when Uncle_Stuart and Auntie_Val came +... [+ IN]

it didn't break . 
the piece of wood that props the plank of wood up +... [+ IN] 
you put on Nana's bag „ didn't you ?

<how many spots> [<] has the ladybird got ? 
six (.) you good boy . 
I expected you to say three and I was going to say what about the other side .

but <you counted> [<] [/] you counted six immediately „ didn't you ? 
oh dear (.) I think that ladybird's had some wine , Thomas . 
why a gentleman ? 
<you [<] [/] you> [?] [//] you're a gentleman ?

do you mean block ? 
or slice ? 
a big plonk@c you said . 
mhm . 
well (.) I very often grate it . 
but today I didn't bother getting the grater on so I just quickly sliced it up and popped it on your sandwich . 
which I thought was alright . 
oh these are nice . 
I've not had these for a long time . 
it says ingredient (.) maize@s:spa +... [+ IN] 
it's like a cereal .

+, when I useta go on the bus with Nana_Bealby into York +... [+ IN] 
+, we useta go to Marks and Spencers and they had (.) they were like cheesy puffs . 
I think they were called cheesy puffs . 
but instead of being shaped like these whatsits they were round balls . 
they tasted just the same . 
perhaps a little bit more cheesy but they were big round balls . 
ooh . 
it were gorgeous . 
but they came in quite big bags and one bag was a little bit too much to eat in one go . 
mhm . 
it was a lot bigger than these little packets . 
when we next go to Marks and Spencers remind me . 
it says on the advert they're big (.) cheesy and crunchy .

does it tingle a bit ? 
mhm . 
well vinegar and salt can both do that to you „ can't they ? 
they can make you [//] your lips tingle . 
oh it's a miserable day . 
it's just doing nothing „ is it ?

I haven't seen any rain today .

you heard Mrs_Johnson say she was taking the logs away ? 
did you hear why she was taking the logs away ? 
no ? 
I just wondered (..) whether it was just something that they do or whether they'd taken them away because perhaps that little girl +//. [+ IN] 
I don't know where she was when she fell and hurt herself . 
I didn't know she'd hurt herself at the time . 
it was much later on when they realized it was serious . 
and guess what ? 
her arm's in a sling now . 
like that . 
she hadta go to the hospital . 
mhm . 
I don't think she was playing a trick „ do you ? 
I don't think you're playing a trick when you pretend to break your arm . 
or at least you're not playing a [/] a trick if you do really break your arm . 
if you pretend to break your arm (.) yes . 
but (.) &-uh (.) if you've really broken your arm then it's not a trick „ is it ?

it's not doing it now . 
right (.) okay you've shown me now so put it down please . 
that's enough of that . 
I was just saying that beaker reminds me of your garage . 
you know the ramp coming out of your garage ? 
this is like the swirly bit that goes all round the garage and out at the bottom . 
only this one (.) it comes out at the top of the drink „ doesn't it ? 
not at the bottom . 
it's like a car whizzing round the car park and then flying out off the roof . 
that's right . 
mhm [<] . 
shh@o [/] shh@o [>] . 
well that could be a plane „ couldn't it „ taking off into the sky .

Max on the Tweenies ? 
yeah . 
he was moving something and pop went on him ? 
what was pop ? 
oh , Thomas , stop it .
