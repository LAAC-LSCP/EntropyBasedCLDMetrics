what says moo@o ? 
cows say moo@o . 
cows say moo@o not sheep . 
are the sheep being rounded up the sheepdog ? 
I can hear a buzzing noise . 
what do you think that is ? 
a buzzy bee ? 
I think it might have something to do with the central heating . 
we're having it sorted out tomorrow „ aren't we ? 
it's making funny noises . 
what about the baa@o lamb , darling ? 
oh the baa@o lamb's having his haircut ? 
yes . 
that's called shearing sheep , Thomas . 
no baa@o . 
well Sue hasn't gone to work yet . 
she's late this morning „ isn't she ? 
Mummy (h)as got to go into work . 
Grandma and Granddad are coming to look after you „ aren't they ? 
what do you think you'll be doing with them ? 
you'll be doing what ? 
peeping ? 
peeping at Postman_Pat's van ? 
who will you be peeping with ? 
Grandma and Granddad ? 
do you think you'll be going up to John_Lewis ? 
buying fire engines ? 
oh . 
from John_Lewis ? 
and who will you be buying fire engines for ? 
for Thomas ? 
riding them ? 
oh I see . 
when you go to John_Lewis do you go to the toy department ? 
and you have a ride in the fire engines and on the trucks ? 
look , Mummy . 
what are you pointing at ? 
oh round and round . 
you're watching the wheel going round „ aren't you ? 
do you know what it is , Thomas ? 
it's a spinning wheel . 
you saw the sheep having it's haircut . 
you saw all <the wool> [//] the fleece coming off the wool when they sheared the sheep . 
well somebody now has taken all that wool and they're combing it . 
I would imagine that's the factory where they make wool . 
you know how we brush Purdie with that special brush ? 
and you see all the fur coming off her ? 
well they [/] they comb the wool like that . 
and then that special wheel's called a spinning wheel . 
and the lady <weaves the wool> [//] spins the wool . 
and it ends up like the wool on the balls of wool that you can see on the television now . 
and they dye it different colors . 
the man's holding some pink wool now „ isn't he ? 
but I think Auntie_Mabel's in the middle of knitting a blue jumper for her sister Edith . 
because we've seen this before . 
and she (h)as run out of wool and she (h)ad gone to the shop . 
and the shop said they hadn't got any in . 
they suggest she go straight to the factory . 
so look can you see ? 
she's going round with a little piece of blue wool that matches the jumper . 
and she's trying to match it up with some new balls of wool . 
do you think she'll find it ? 
I bet Pippin does if she doesn't . 
is Pippin hiding ? 
oh he's a tinker that Pippin „ isn't he ? 
don't say that . 
he's a tinker . 
little tinker . 
we can't have jam on toast +/. [+ IN] 
because we have +//. [+ IN] 
oh you'd like cheese ? 
because we haven't got any jam . 
is Pippin hiding ? 
where's Pippin hiding ? 
is he running round the factory ? 
the wool factory ? 
would you like some cheese on this toast , Thomas ? 
or some Marmite ? 
no [<] . 
it's not moo@o . 
it's baa@o . 
you can see a sheep . 
what are baby sheep called ? 
they're called lambs . 
you enjoyed those Cornflakes „ didn't you ? 
that's a a black sheep and a white sheep . 
no baa@o .

you think it's a fireman now ? 
he's driving a fire engine ? 
what do you think he's going to do ? 
put out a fire ? 
and where do you think the fire is ? 
where do you think the fire is , Thomas ? 
hosepipe ? 
he's using his hosepipe „ is he ? 
to put out the fire ? 
sprinkling on lots_of water . 
I've got my hands in water at the moment . 
because I'm just doing a little bit of washing up .

and then what happened ?

Sonia fell down ? 
no she didn't . 
Sonia took her out „ didn't she ? 
it was storytime at playgroup . 
and Sonia was reading the story . 
and Isabelle wasn't very happy because Isabelle couldn't see the book . 
and Isabelle kept saying she couldn't see . 
and her Mummy kept moving the book hoping she could see . 
but she couldn't . 
and she got terribly upset „ didn't she ? 
and in the end her Mummy hadta take her out . 
and she hadta stop reading the story and pass the storybook to somebody else . 
but I think this has happened before . 
and it was Isabelle's book , Thomas . 
it was Isabelle's special book . 
and I don't think Isabelle liked sharing it with other people „ did she ? 
I think she just felt that her Mummy should just read it too her . 
a teddy bear . 
a butterfly and a teddy bear . 
oh do you know what they're doing on the television now ? 
they're making jelly . 
they're making jelly using jelly moulds .

it's wobbling on the plate „ isn't it ? 
jelly does that . 
oh <this story &t> [//] this is the storytime that we've seen before , Thomas . 
because the book's called Don't_Stick_Your_Finger_In_The_Jelly_Nelly . 
I think that's why they're showing jelly . 
there's <a little &st> [//] a little rhyme about jelly . 
jelly wobbling .
