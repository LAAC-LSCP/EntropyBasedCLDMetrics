but we can hear it „ can't we ? 
no . 
we can't see it . 
is it hiding in the clouds ? 
well sometimes when people's car alarms go off the headlights flash „ don't they ? 
so we know which car it is . 
and when people's house alarms go off there's usually a light that flashes . 
we have a blue light that flashes if our alarm (h)as gone off to tell us that there's been a problem while we've been out . 
so that's how we can usually see . 
but we can't see what it is today . 
no [<] . 
we can't see it „ can we ? 
oh look . 
a red bus . 
did you see the red bus going past ? 
are you telling me you didn't see the red bus properly because you're having your nappie changed ?

you wanna play with your toys now .

you wanna see what Mummy (h)as got in that box . 
well just a moment .

I always wash my hands when I've changed your nappie . 
it wasn't really dirty though . 
it was just a little bit wet „ wasn't it ? 
just a little wet . 
there we are . 
another alarm . 
I think it was the same one , Thomas . 
somewhere hiding in the clouds .

there's an alarm ringing . 
it's annoying the alarm „ isn't it ? 
right . 
what have we got in this box ? 
a rainbow . 
you can see a rainbow . 
there we are . 
it says +"/.

oh you're not three yet „ are you ? 
how old (i)s Thomas ?

that's Purdie coming downstairs . 
did you hear her ? 
what did she say ? 
meow . 
no . 
don't worry , Purdie . 
we're here . 
come on , Purdie . 
look at the rainbow . 
Thomas wants to show you the rainbow on the picture . 
the big elephant there . 
yes . 
well this is lovely because it's a book . 
it's called “an alphabet jigsaw book” . 
and for every page it takes so many letters of the alphabet . 
the first one is a@l b@l c@l d@l e@l f@l . 
and on there +/. [+ IN] 
two rainbows . 
and on there <there's something> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
a baby rainbow and a big rainbow . 
so every page has a picture with something on it starting with that letter . 
like the first one has an elephant under a letter e@l and the last one has a zebra under the letter z@l . 
so what can we see ? 
just let me let Purdie out of the door because I think she wants to go outside . 
oh I can hear the alarm more clearly now . 
www . 
meow . 
out you go , pussycat . 
say bye bye . 
she's going out . 
bye bye , pussycat . 
out we go , Purdie . 
xxx . 
oh she doesn't wanna go out „ does she ? 
I think the noise of the fireworks have been upsetting Purdie recently . 
they make very loud bangs and Purdie doesn't like it „ does she ? 
so shall we take this one out ? 
look . 
take the pieces out . 
break it into four . 
you've got a jigsaw . 
now can you put the jigsaw back together , Thomas ? 
on one side it's shiny . 
on the other side it's smooth . 
look . 
it's matte . 
and it's only the shiny side we've got to play with . 
the other side is something else . 
are you putting the bits together ? 
well look . 
there's the little dog . 
where's the dog on this picture ? 
down there . 
so shall we put this piece there ? 
on top of that one . 
like that . 
and what's this piece ? 
where's the bird ? 
there . 
yes . 
so shall we put that there ? 
and what about the two pieces you've got in your hand ?

what song do we know that ends in 0 [=! sneezing sound] . 
0 [=! makes sneezing sound] [<] . 
Mummy do it for you . 
well let's [/] let's just see , Thomas . 
does that bit look like that bit ? 
it does . 
you want this one out now . 
oh you look at this one . 
this one (h)as a monkey on it ? 
and I'll put the other one back together . 
I think we've lost a piece . 
have you got a piece down there ? 
oh here it is on the floor . 
Mummy's just going to get a tissue and blow her nose . 
oh I think it does . 
look . 
can you see the eyes on the elephant ? 
and do you wanna put that piece there ? 
press it down . 
no . 
oh why not , Thomas ? 
the eyes have come off the elephant . 
orange snake and a green snake . 
well I think the orange snake is a caterpillar because it begins with letter c@l and that's on this page . 
and I think +... [+ IN] 
and I think what you're calling the green snake is actually a lizard . 
that begins with l@l and that's on this page . 
oh now you know what that is . 
what is it ? 
what is it ? 
a what ? 
it's a fish and you know very well what a fish is . 
that's an octopus . 
and that's the sun . 
a kite . 
well you know what that is . 
and you know what that is . 
if you're just going to point to everything and say <what's this> [/] <what's [>] this> [/] what's this . 
a rainbow . 
no . 
it's an umbrella but it (h)as probably got all the colors of the rainbow in it . 
that's [>] an iguana . 
iguana . 
that's a jolly hard word for you to learn „ <isn't it> [>] ? 
oh what do you think that is , Thomas ? 
you've been talking about those earlier today . 
do you think it's a cloud ? 
the eyes have come off the elephant „ have they ? 
shall we take this one out ? 
this is the one with the octopus on it and the rainbow . 
wow . 
the eyes have come off . 
and you want that one as well . 
can you see the bee ? 
actually it might be a wasp . 
we've got the letter w@l on this page but they're saying w@l is for wheel . 
but there is a wasp on there or [/] or perhaps [>] +/. [+ IN] 
you wanna do it . 
alright . 
you take it down . 
oh you're a bit ratty , Thomas . 
who's in a grump ? 
another bee . 
yes . 
that's right . 
because the picture remains on the page and you've taken the jigsaw . 
and the jigsaw has an identical picture . 
a carrot . 
yes . 
how many things on the picture have eyes ? 
the [>] elephant has eyes . 
xxx [<] . 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine .
