Thomas press a button ? 
did you press a button somewhere ? 
on the car ? 
on the car door ? 
oh I know what you're talking about . 
when we were coming home we were walking back to the car . 
and you saw some people waiting at the pelican crossing . 
to cross the road . 
and you wanted to press the button „ didn't you ? 
and watch the green man come on . 
so that we could go across the road . 
but we didn't needta cross the road . 
we cross the road when we go on the bus . 
and we hafta go to the other bus stop . 
this is the electric bread knife . 
that's the noise it makes . 
we've sliced the bread . 
we're putting it away in the cupboard now . 
so we've seen Sonia and Isabelle two days running „ haven't we ? 
have you been screaming ? 
because yesterday we went to Sonia's house at lunch time „ didn't we ? 
and Ben and Charlotte (.) and Rachel and Jonathan were at Sonia's house yesterday . 
and they were all at playgroup this morning . 
so you've seen them two days running . 
Monday and Tuesday . 
two days running . 
there's some crisps .

did you have some toast and blackcurrant juice this morning at playgroup ? 
Mummy's making a lot of noise in the kitchen „ isn't she ? 
there's some little cheese sandwiches there , Thomas . 
I'll put some of this bread in the toaster . 
the toaster doesn't make that noise , Thomas . 
the bread knife does . 
the electric bread knife . 
it makes an awful noise „ doesn't it ? 
the sun's shining now . 
oh we can go outside after lunch .

they lit up quite early yesterday because it wasn't a very nice day . 
but the sun's shining now . 
so I don't think you'll see the street lamps . 
it'll be funny tomorrow morning though . 
because the sun's going to go out . 
the sun will hide . 
and the stars will come out in the middle of the morning . 
yes . 
you'll think it's night time . 
are you going to watch the eclipse on the television with Grandma and Granddad ? 
because Mummy will be at work „ won't she ? 
Granddad (h)as been telling you all about the eclipse of the sun „ hasn't he ? 
oops did you drop that piece of cheese ? 
oh you've caught it . 
you're very quiet , Thomas „ aren't you ? 
are you a sleepy boy ?

you were a very lucky Thomas . 
because Christmas and your birthday you got lots and lots_of toys . 
but you didn't get any the same „ did you ? 
shall we do it again ? 
how about we try the racing car ? 
that's right . 
you bring that because it works with the same key . 
oh you're bringing all they toys „ are you now ? 
oh this will be like the other day . 
when we had everything on the floor . 
thank you , poppet . 
on the floor . 
right . 
we'll use this key . 
to wind up the racing car . 
oh what a lot of noise . 
right . 
please . 
otherwise we're going to have a crash . 
and we're off ! 
gosh . 
it did crash that „ didn't it ? 
let's turn it round . 
see if it'll go the other way . 
gosh he drives quickly „ doesn't he ? 
hope we never meet him on the road .
