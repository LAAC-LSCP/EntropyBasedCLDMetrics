I only changed the one [>] +... [+ IN] 
+, that ran out . 
<and now> [>] this one's run out .

what do you think you are ? 
both ? 
you're both ? 
you'll be a very busy man then . 
do you ? 
well you're a superman then in that case . 
oh is it ?

+" men out of the way ? 
sorry what we're you saying ? 
oh do they ? 
who's Roy ? 
Roy the builder ? 
Roy the Early learning bus . 
well I'm doing this jigsaw from Marks and Spencers . 
I do yes . 
&=laughs . 
<are you> [<] ? 
oh dear why ? 
because you think Mummy will always be there ? 
<women's things> [>] . 
is that what Nanna makes you do ? 
look at women's things in Marks and Spencers [>] ? 
well I think this is a busy route that I'm making . 
this jigsaw has ten [>] +... [+ IN] 
+, big cardboard cut outs of vehicles [>] . 
well +... [+ IN] 
oh dear . 
I thought the fire brigade would be involved somewhere . 
and each of these vehicles +... [+ IN] 
+, <taxis fire engines buses> [>] . 
yes . 
+, they each have a number on them „ don't they ? 
and the number <say this one> [//] on the fire engine number nine +... [+ IN] 
how many firemen are in the <fire engine> [>] ? 
nine . 
how many people are on the bus ? 
very good . 
that's a nice blue that Tesco lorry . 
is that the one that Uncle_David bought you ? 
<you've swapped> [<] the cabs „ have you ? 
ahhah that's why it looks very blue . 
yes . 
it doesn't really look like the Tesco lorry that you see on the road „ <does it> [>] ? 
does it not fit properly ? 
no . 
it doesn't look strange . 
I just thought it looked a beautiful blue lorry . 
but of course that's the difference (be)cause usually the cabs are white „ aren't they ? 
that's fine that's okay . 
it's fine by me . 
right . 
you know what we could do one day with these as well ? 
we could actually draw round them with stencils and color them in . 
is that the supermarket ? 
<I do > [<] . 
oh is it ? 
okay . 
what nice things have you got in Tesco truck Thomas ?

<look the> [<] wheel's bent look .

no . 
0 [=! coughs] .

<driving my truck> [>] .

I bet you can't really drive a truck with your high heels because of all the pedals . 
you've got to (.) work your feet on the pedals . 
and I don't think many lorry drivers wear high heels . 
well lady drivers I still don't think would wear any high heels when they were driving trucks Thomas . 
that's right . 
it's hard to drive in high heels . 
which is why when Mummy drives I've got some flat scruffy shoes that I have in the car . 
because &-uh apart from it being hard to put the pedals down you ruin all the back of your heels <on the> [//] on the bottom of the car (.) when you're putting the pedals down . 
and apart from that whether its a man or lady if their driver drops +//. [+ IN] 
say you were going to Tesco and you had all those huge trollies to push in full of boxes +... [+ IN]

you would . 
you'd fall over and break your ankle „ wouldn't you ?

if the trolley fell on your head ? 
yeah . 
<you could yeah> [>] . 
and it could be slippery really „ couldn't it ? 
&-uh Thomas where's vehicle number four ? 
how many police people are in the car ?

is it ? 
that's right . 
well I think people driving through the night still need petrol .

there's going to be far more people at the petrol station during the day „ aren't there ?

<well I don't> [>] +... [+ IN]

<a three at the top> [<] with a line and a four at the bottom is three quarters ? 
ah that's very clever . 
and do you know what a half is ? 
two minutes off one ? 
&=laughs . 
do you know what a half looks like if you were <writing a half> [>] down ? 
you can do . 
well it's nice as it is for a change . 
but if it runs better with the proper cab on then I'd pop [/] pop the old cab on . 
yes . 
would it ? 
do you know what that Tesco tanker says ?
