www . 
no . 
take this one . 
but the lego train's made of plastic , Thomas . 
and it's easy to wash . 
if you're playing with the wooden one when you're eating and you get milk on it or greasy fingers then it's not easy to clean . 
just going to open the curtain . 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engines ? 
two carriages .

would you like to get in your chair please . 
what did the postman bring this morning , Thomas ? 
a Christmas letter ?

Christmas letter . 
let me have a look . 
oh I see . 
it (h)as got a picture of Father_Christmas on the front . 
so you're quite right . 
it's a Christmas letter . 
and you're saying Norman because it looks like Norman_the_Gnome „ doesn't it ? 
oh look . 
on the back there's a Christmas pudding . 
and there's a picture of <&crack> [//] a Christmas cracker . 
a snowman . 
a stick of candy . 
that's like sister Sandy . 
do you remember the song ? 
Sister Sandy going to a shop to buy a stick of candy ? 
some holly berries . 
a teddy bear . 
a Christmas pudding . 
a Christmas stocking . 
a Christmas tree . 
and then we get back to the Christmas cracker and snowman again . 
that's very clever <knowing that's a Christmas letter> [>] . 
and I can see why you thought Father_Christmas was Norman_the_Gnome . 
because he looks the same „ doesn't he ? 
you talking about Thomas_The_Tank_Engine ?

and the other a bowl <of Rice> [//] of Cornflakes ?

&=laughs . 
right . 
I'm going to make some toast now . 
you'd like some marmalade on it ? 
red jam and yellow marmalade ? 
oh dear [/] dear . 
Mummy did some ironing last night . 
and I was just putting the water sprayer away and I've knocked everything out of the cupboard . 
so that was silly „ wasn't it ? 
mhm . 
I've got to put it all back now . 
are you slurping ? 
you don't want any toast ? 
oh . 
I thought you were just discussing red jam and yellow marmalade . 
well Mummy's going to have some . 
hurry [/] hurry . 
I'm sure if I put some butter on some toast , Thomas . 
you'd eat a little bit „ won't you ? 
oh the toaster keeps poping up . 
I'll put some jam on one piece . 
and some marmalade on another . 
and some marmite on another one . 
and then you can choose which one you want . 
a yellow one . 
you mean one with marmalade ? 
pushing coaches in the yard ? 
you pushing coaches in the yard is that one [/] one of the Thomas_The_Tank_Engine videos ? 
do they push coaches in the yard ? 
I think I +/. [+ IN] 
oh has that coach got a Rice_Krispie on it ? 
well you (h)ad better wipe it off quickly . 
because that's the [//] one of the wooden trains „ isn't it ? 
and if you get things on that (.) it doesn't clean very well . 
the toaster doesn't wanna stay down this morning . 
you seen Purdie this morning , Thomas ? 
she went out last night really late „ didn't she ? 
she didn't wanna come home . 
I think she's really frightened by a firework . 
and was to frightened to come out of wherever she was hiding . 
hiding under the table ? 
well she wasn't hiding under the patio table . 
because Mummy was looking for her . 
and couldn't see her there . 
yes . 
yes . 
I'm doing one now . 
yes . 
okay . 
I'm just giving you a selection . 
xxx can choose . [+ PI] 
I haven't done a red one yet , Thomas . 
just a moment . 
we're going to need a new jar of marmalade xxx . [+ PI] 
this one's empty now . 
there you are . 
and there's a red one and there's a <yellow one> [>] . 
pardon ? 
a big one ? 
what do you mean a big one ? 
big blue one ? 
what do you mean big blue one , darling ? 
this ? 
oh no . 
that's a packet for the fridge ? 
or this ? 
milk in a blue bottle ? 
oh_gosh . 
that was the cupboard door . 
they spring shut „ don't they ? 
very quickly . 
got to keep an eye on the toaster . 
because it's not poping up like it should . 
have you finished with the Cornflakes now , Thomas ? 
shall Mummy finish them off ? 
please may I have the Cornflakes ? 
that's toast with Marmite . 
that's toast with raspberry jam . 
red jam as you call it . 
and that's toast with orange marmalade . 
is the red one nice ? 
it's raspberry jam . 
no . 
that one's orange marmalade . 
but it looks yellow „ doesn't it ? 
mm . 
I enjoyed that , Thomas . 
that's raspberry jam . 
sometimes we have strawberry jam . 
but that's raspberry . 
it (h)as got a lot more seeds in it „ hasn't it ? 
can you see the jar ? 
look at the jar of jam . 
can you see the little seeds ? 
look at it . 
well look . 
can you see all those little pips ? 
little seeds ? 
it's red jam but it (h)as got lots_of sort of yellowy creamy seeds „ hasn't it ? 
all I can hear , Thomas , is you crunching your toast . 
I can't hear anything outside „ can you ? 
no fireworks . 
no . 
no we can do without fireworks at this time in the morning „ can't we ? 
really people should only let fireworks off on the fifth of November . 
that's Friday evening . 
but we've had them for the past sort of two or three weeks „ haven't we ? 
and they're loud bangs „ don't they ? 
anybody [>] +... [+ IN] 
pardon ? 
a blue one ? 
I've opened the fridge again and I'm not sure whether you mean the blue packet that's in the fridge which is fish . 
or whether you mean +... [+ IN] 
<the big bottle> [<] of milk . 
with the blue lid . 
the fish . 
that's the one you mean „ is it ? 
this is the fish . 
this is fish . 
we're going to have fish . 
<your milk> [>] has the blue lid . 
and Mummy and Daddy's milk has the green lid . 
hold it together ? 
what do you wanna hold , Thomas ? 
the blue lid and the green lid ? 
you wanna hold the milk ? 
well I don't think that's a good idea „ do you ? 
because it needs to be kept in the fridge to keep cold and if we start holding it it's going to warm up . 
yours is full fat milk and Mummy and Daddy drink semi skimmed . 
and that's new words for you . 
full fat and semi skimmed . 
pardon ? 
a bridge ? 
you wanna play with your train and the bridge ? 
oh . 
and the train (h)as hit Mummy's plate „ hasn't it ? 
did it make a ping@o when it hit ? 
again [/] again ? 
you're going to do with it one of the carriages ? 
oh ! 
oh I can hear birds outside now . 
cheep^cheep^cheep@o ?

that train (h)as fallen on the floor „ hasn't it ? 
oh [>] . 
<oh Thomas what> [>] +... [+ IN] 
what do you say ? 
the carriage hit the other train ? 
but I was meaning more what do you say when you've made a rude noise like you just made . 
excuse me please ? 
not heard ? 
I heard you making a very rude noise . 
well that funny noise is the noise of air coming out of your drinking beaker . 
can you hear it ? 
that high pitch whistle ? 
hm: ? 
Jess ? 
were you talking about Jess ? 
you want Jess the pussy cat ? 
sit on top of the train ? 
two carriages on the trailer ? 
there you are . 
there's Jess . 
she can sit on the roof of the driver's cab „ can't she ? 
are you going to eat your toast , Thomas ? 
I don't think we've got another trailer that fits that „ have we ? 
which color ? 
the red one ? 
oh the racing car's not a trailer „ is it ? 
it's a racing car . 
just a second . 
let Mummy finish her toast please . 
we're in a rush remember . 
are you going to finish these ? 
what about some apple ? 
would you like some apple ? 
no what ? 
I think that train's a little bit too big to go underneath the tunnel „ don't you ? 
there are three tunnels . 
but I think even the largest tunnel is still too small for that train . 
especially when Jess is sitting on top . 
it's big enough for Jess to go through on her own „ isn't it ? 
smashed ? 
you're taking the train to pieces ? 
oh what's happening now ? 
oh I see . 
you've turned <the crane> [//] <the &pl> [//] the train into a crane „ have you ? 
and you're holding it up in the air . 
the poor horse . 
are you lifting the horse for the crane ? 
now do you think the train on it's own will go through the tunnel ? 
no [<] . 
what about if we turn it round ? 
no . 
still too big . 
oh dear [/] dear , Thomas . 
no . 
we turned it round and it still won't fit „ will it ? 
no . 
not that way either . 
have you really finished this then ? 
you don't want anything else ? 
Jess not through ? 
can Jess not go through ? 
I think Jess could go through . 
look . 
Jess can go through the largest tunnel . 
quite easily . 
no . 
she can't go through the smaller one . 
right . 
and you don't want any apple ? 
I tell you what .

and then perhaps you'll have some apple later on .

you saw them collect the rubbish from Sue's house ?

she (h)as finished her breakfast . 
she's licking her paw with her tongue .

she's using her other paw now to wash the other side . 
when you've had your breakfast we give you a wash „ don't we ? 
with a sponge and soap and a flannel .

that's funny „ isn't it ?

can you still see her ?
