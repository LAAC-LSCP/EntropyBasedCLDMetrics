do you ? 
which one ? 
oh never mind . 
well you [//] eat the sweet of that one if it (h)as broken .

me and Thomas eating biscuits and sweeties . 
biscuits with icing on them (.) sweeties ! 
hm: (.) that little sweet is clear „ is it ? 
sort of whitie clear . 
it's hard to see against the icing „ is it ? 
yes , love ? 
<are they> [<] ? 
are they ? 
is that why +//. [+ N] 
<I do know> [/] I do know why they're green and grey . 
they're two different shades of green „ are they ? 
I've never seen green or grey Smarties . 
I'll read the packet and see if it tells me . 
because I know a while ago you could buy just orange Smarties . 
and they were my favorite . 
no (.) they're not blue „ are they ? 
nope . 
does say anything . 
but on the packet it shows grey Smarties (.) which is what you're eating (..) and two different shades of green . 
yes . 
pardon ? 
there's a picture of a dinosaur there (.) look . 
yes . 
there are more in there . 
do get any +//. [+ N] 
no (.) do . 
please do take anymore out , Thomas . 
you've had enough now . 
right (.) <no no> [/] no . 
no more . 
mhm . 
actually I think the grey ones are different ones . 
those are shiny grey like a silvery and the others are dull grey . 
perhaps that's it . 
two shades <of green> [>] . 
and a grey . 
very good . 
you [<] do . 
no [/] no . 
there's no more sweets . 
you do want any more biscuits ? 
why do you take the icing off there because +//. [+ N] 
you [/] you've got that yoghurt pot stuck on your ear . 
why do you (..) <get the icing off> [>] the biscuit ? 
yes . 
oh that's funny „ is it ? 
right (.) are you going to eat this one up now , Thomas ? 
we'll have a little break now while we wash our hands and (.) wash the pots (.) I think . 
and then we can read those books about decorating the tree . 
because it reminded me of those books when we used these little sweeties to brighten up otherwise dull biscuits . 
now there's some icing on that plate if you want the icing . 
mhm . 
well that's funny . 
it's a Bob_The_Builder plate . 
<and the icing (h)as gone> [<] all over the digger . 
is that the digger that (.) &-uh (.) toy ? 
it is quite funny that „ is it ? 
now I'll put these biscuits on another plate . 
to dry off . 
that looks like a face „ does it ? 
green eye and a grey eye . 
<and that> [<] one the icing (h)as just gone in the shape +//. [+ N] 
it's almost like a heart shape and you've put some red on it . 
is that nice ? 
are you making patterns in the icing with your finger ? 
that's like doing finger painting „ is it ? 
does it taste good , Thomas ? 
no ? 
it's very easy to make icing „ is it ? 
a little bit of icing sugar and some water . 
and then sweets ? 
yes (.) but you you do need sweets to make the icing „ do we ? 
<do we> [>] ? 
I think you're going to need more than your teeth brushing . 
I think <you'll need your face washing as well> [>] . 
mixing it round . 
mixing like Dizzy ? 
right (.) are you going to have that one ? 
sweet ? 
no (.) do be dirty , Thomas . 
and what can you see now that you've licked the icing off the plate ? 
Pilchard the cat's there as well „ is he ? 
is Pilchard a boy cat or a little girl ? 
no (.) not a black one . 
a boy or a girl ? 
it's a blue cat . 
mhm . 
pardon ? 
well that does matter because there are no crumbs on the plate and you've licked most of the icing off . 
you never do that with a plate with food on it . 
or when it (h)as got lots_of crumbs . 
because that would make a mess „ would it ? 
right (.) that's enough now . 
and what can you see on Mummy's plate ? 
two rabbits . 
and what's the big rabbit doing ? 
do you think she's giving one to the little rabbit ? 
well there's a butterfly on there as well (.) look . 
and the little rabbit's sitting on a toadstool ! 
well she might do . 
well the butterfly does look as if it's going to smell the flower „ does it ? 
pardon ? 
you love me ? 
mhm . 
I love you . 
you've moved your beaker between the plates (..) and there's a small gap and then there's a big gap and you've squeezed through it „ have you ? 
are you talking about big boulders [>] ? 
watch you do knock your drink on the floor please , Thomas . 
will you move your drink please . 
before it goes on the floor . 
that's it . 
thank you . 
that's a good boy . 
are you sniffing ? 
would you like me to wipe your nose ? 
good boy . 
did you say you saw a kitten ? 
<<it's a> [?] little mouse> [<] . 
and I was saying when we decorated <those biscuits> [>] +... [+ N] 
mice [<] . 
let me +//. [+ N] 
I've just wiped your hands . 
let's roll your sleeves <down again> [>] . 
they're [>] nice „ are they ? 
can you see all the stars sparkling in the sky in this book ? 
it's called the gift of Christmas . 
and that's what it's about . 
it's Christmas and Molly mouse is out in the woods looking for Christmas decorations . [+ R] 
it seems that everything she finds belongs to someone else . [+ R] 
maybe though (.) because it's Christmas (.) every animal is feeling generous and Molly soon has everything she needs for her special tree . [+ R] 
but Molly feels disappointment (.) the tree needs just one magical finishing touch . [+ R] 
right (.) shall we read it and find out what it is ? 
this book (.) actually (.) is a book I bought for Molly . 
you know Molly in Glossop ? 
when it was her birthday ? 
we bought her a little pair of mittens and we bought her this book as well . 
&-um (.) because she's just starting to learn to read (.) Molly . 
and I thought it would be a nice (.) a book with her name in it . 
right (.) I'll read the book and if you wanna tell me what's going on . 
it was Molly mouse +//. [+ N] 
0 [=! clears throat] . 
I can speak . 
it was Molly mouse's first Christmas . [+ R] 
the sky was streaked with pink and gold . [+ R] 
yes +//. [+ N] 
&-uh (.) not [/] not worms . 
they're little pine needles that have fallen off the tree „ are they ? 
the sky was streaked with pink and gold and there was a tingle in the air . [+ R] 
you know like Jack_Frost ? 
when Jack_Frost has been ? 
through the window of the house something shone out and glittered in the night . [+ R] 
was it Santa's sleigh ? 
“what is it , Mum” squeaked Molly . [+ R] 
it's called a Christmas tree said her mother . [+ R] 
people cover it with shiny balls and lights and stars . [+ R] 
I wish we had a Christmas tree sighed Molly . [+ R] 
why not go into the woods to find one said her Mum . [+ R] 
<you could make it look> [<] just as pretty as that <tree in the window> [>] . 
I do know because we have read it yet . 
Molly thought this was a wonderful idea . [+ R] 
she called her brothers and sisters and off they scampered . [+ R] 
on the way they came to a barn and the mice rummaged through it looking for something to add to their tree . [+ R] 
under a big pile of hay Molly found a doll . [+ R] 
this is like the one on top of the Christmas tree in the window she said . [+ R] 
it will be just right for our tree . [+ R] 
but the doll already had an owner . [+ R] 
grrr@o said the old farm dog . [+ R] 
do chase us cried Molly mouse . [+ R] 
I only thought the doll would be nice for our Christmas tree . [+ R] 
the old dog yawned . [+ R] 
sometimes it was true (.) he did chase mice (.) but maybe because it was Christmas (.) or maybe because he was remembering the time when he (h)ad played with the children by the farmhouse Christmas tree he said the mice could borrow his toy . [+ R] 
that's nice „ is it ? 
do know . 
you hope it's not a ghost ? 
I do think it will be a ghost „ do you ? 
the mice left the farmyard carrying the doll and reached the edge of the wood . [+ R] 
hey I found something else to put on our tree Molly shouted . [+ R] 
it was a silver ribbon hanging from a branch of an old oak tree . [+ R] 
Molly scampered up the trunk (.) took hold of the ribbon and pulled . [+ R] 
but the ribbon belonged to a magpie . [+ R] 
the magpie had taken it to line her nest . [+ R] 
oh please do be cross pleaded Molly . [+ R] 
I only wanted something for our Christmas tree . [+ R] 
now usually the magpie chase mice (.) but maybe because it was Christmas or maybe because she too had been admiring the Christmas tree in the window (.) she let go of the other end of the ribbon and Molly took it away . [+ R] 
what can you see up in that tree ? 
oh (.) what can you see ? 
<a nest> [<] ? 
what do we call +/. [+ N] 
<what do we call nests> [<] ? 
a bag of toys . 
in the distance Molly saw some red shiny things lying on the ground . [+ R] 
they were like the balls on the Christmas tree in the window . [+ R] 
exactly what we want cried Molly running to pick one of them up . [+ R] 
now we have a doll (.) a silver ribbon and a shiny ball . [+ R] 
but the shiny balls [//] balls belong to a fox . [+ R] 
those are my crabapples he barked ! [+ R]
