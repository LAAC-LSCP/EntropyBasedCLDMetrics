and two trees that look like Christmas trees . 
and two trees that look like oak trees . 
you think that's a fence ? 
oh have the trees fallen over ? 
and look there's some little people +//. [+ IN] 
four people . 
do you think each one of these lives in one of these houses ? 
each house can have a tree and a little person to live inside . 
and <the gate> [//] the fence between the houses look . 
and what else have we got here ? 
two +... [+ IN] 
+, little wooden horses ? 
clomp^clomp^clomp@o . 
oh are you showing Purdie ? 
look , Thomas . 
the horses could actually ride . 
two horses will fit into your train carriage . 
look at that ! 
wow ! 
and in fact the four people could all go for a ride in the train as well . 
one two three four . 
the train's going through the bridge . 
past the school . 
past the houses . 
and round the trees . 
that's a lovely little set „ isn't it ? 
oh ! 
has the train run onto the fence ? 
oh dear [/] dear . 
is it going backwards ? 
behind the church ? 
behind the church . 
could it go at the front of the church ? 
or at the side of the church ? 
or what about round the church ? 
past the church ? 
oh dear has the church fallen over ? 
tick tock better ? 
is the clock still working ? 
oh dear . 
what does the church clock strike ? 
ticktock [/] ticktock . 
does it go boing^boing@o . 
the only trouble with this train set , Thomas . 
is that the building that we're not quite sure whether it's a school or a church is actually +/. [+ IN] 
about the same size as the train . 
and the houses are much smaller than the train „ aren't they ? 
perhaps the houses are set quite a way back from the railway line . 
and things always look smaller when they're far away . 
so perhaps the people sitting on the train +//. [+ IN] 
when they look at the houses in the distance (.) that's the size they look . 
are you still tired , sweetheart ? 
yes . 
just going to let Purdie out again . 
what's the matter puss ? 
you're playing . 
oh can Mummy just feed Purdie ? 
and then I'll come back to play . 
in a minute . 
would you talk to me about the trees and the houses , Thomas ? 
you tell me what you're playing with . 
how many houses are there ? 
four houses ? 
and what color are the roofs ? 
what color are the roofs on the houses , Thomas ? 
are they red ? 
what (h)as fallen down , darling ? 
the roofs ? 
oh dear . 
don't upset Purdie . 
she's just going to have some lunch . 
oh no that's a fence . 
that's the part of the little bit of fence in between the houses . 
like there's a fence in between us and where Auntie_Linda and Uncle_Brian +/. [+ IN] 
Mummy play ? 
I'll come +/. [+ IN] 
the roof (h)as +/. [+ IN] 
oh it hasn't come off . 
no . 
they've just xxx make it better . [+ PI] 
look at the sun now . 
isn't it nice ? 
the sun's shining . 
Mummy feels happy when the sun shines . 
it's a fence . 
you can either put it in between the houses or look . 
shall we make +//. [+ IN] 
if we make a square shape with it . 
there we are . 
look . 
if we put the house there (.) then we can do this . 
look . 
build a fence . 
would you like to pass me a tree please ? 
right . 
there's the house . 
there are +//. [+ IN] 
it's surrounded by trees . 
look . 
there are trees in the garden . 
and we could put the horses in there . 
and they wouldn't escape because there's a nice fence around . 
they're all falling over „ aren't they ? 
I think what we need is to perhaps play with them on the table , Thomas . 
fallen over again ? 
oh dear dear [/] dear . 
what eh to do . 
well shall we play with them at the table ? 
because at least you've got a nice flat surface „ haven't you ? 
the train (.) and the trees and the houses , Thomas , are all made from wood . 
they're beautiful „ aren't they ? 
very nice toys . 
<can you see the> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
the houses each have windows and doors . 
do you remember the book about Johnny_Tall the giraffe ? 
yes . 
it arrived at the nursery . 
<in a box> [<] . 
and he couldn't get out . 
because there were no windows and doors in the box . 
and they made him some windows and doors . 
he was so tall he couldn't get out . 
and in the end they hadta reach in with a crane „ didn't they ? 
this could be the little village . 
look , Thomas . 
Mummy grew up in a village . 
there's the church . 
and there are little houses . 
there are three houses here . 
and one over there . 
I think perhaps when we go to John_Lewis next week +//. [+ IN] 
oops . 
have you fallen off your chair ? 
we won't be going next week . 
but the week after (.) we'll buy you some more . 
and we could make quite a large village . 
are you comfortable now , Thomas ? 
look there's the +//. [+ IN] 
shall we call it a church or a school ? 
what do you think ? 
is it a church ? 
right . 
well there's three houses in a row . 
and then some trees . 
no . 
they hadn't fallen over . 
until you tipped them up . 
and that's the fence look . 
they could be a duck pond though . 
with ducks swimming . 
but instead we'll have a paddock „ shall we ? 
an area of grass for the horses to graze . 
and there's another house here look . 
and it (h)as got some trees . 
there can you see the village ? 
all falling down ? 
and look these little people are +//. [+ IN] 
they're coming out <of houses> [>] and going to church . 
and this person is going to have a look at the tree . 
to see if there are any conkers . 
any conkers fallen off the trees ? 
and that little person could be going to feed the horses . 
<and the other person> [>] +/. 
the other person that looks like Tinky_Winky +//. [+ IN] 
the purple one . 
is lying down on the floor over there . 
oh you're sitting in the sun . 
aren't you lucky ? 
big bright shiny sun . 
well it's a little bit different from the houses . 
the houses have one door and two windows . 
but the church or the school has +//. [+ IN] 
we can't actually see a door it (h)as just got three arched windows . 
and a tower and a clock . 
one o'clock . 
two o'clock . 
three o'clock . 
four o'clock . 
that's the time on the church clock . 
four o'clock . 
if it's four a clock it's time for tea . 
I think all those people that are wandering around the village should go back to somebody's house for a cup of tea . 
<the roof (h)as> [<] +... [+ IN] 
oh that's the fence . 
the fence fell over „ didn't it ? 
I'm a little bit worried about you , Thomas Lastname . 
do you know why ? 
because you've got spots on your face . 
you have a little +//. [+ IN] 
you have a little spot there that you've had all day . 
but you look as if you've got other spots now . 
you're not +//. [+ IN] 
is it a bite ? 
bite you ?

I think the train might run through the village . 
on it's way to the town . 
and the little yellow one +//. [+ IN] 
look . 
he (h)as come out of his house . 
and he's walking towards the station . 
and he's thinking “hm: I wonder if there's a train to York coming along in a second” . 
+" or perhaps I could get on a train to Blackpool and go and see Grandma and Granddad . 
is the train coming ? 
the yellow man . 
is he going to catch the train ? 
where's he going to go , Thomas ? 
he's going to Manchester „ is he ?

the blue man's going to catch the train instead „ is he ?

well I'm just sitting down with a cup of coffee . 
do you think purple man would like some ?

because you know the man that came +//. [+ IN] 
walked down the train on Saturday with the trolley ?

it looked like he (h)ad been shopping at the supermarket . 
well he was selling tea and coffee and drinks and crisps „ wasn't he ? 
well the purple man was so thirsty on the train . 
he was really [/] really looking forward to the trolley coming past . 
and when it did the man said I've no hot water I've only got fruit juice and cold drinks . 
and the man said no thank you . 
I want a hot cup of coffee .

nice trees . 
and here look . 
there's a little paddock . 
shall we call it a paddock ? 
it's where the horses live . 
there we are . 
the horses are going to watch the train going past . 
if it was Thomas_The_Tank_Engine what do you think he'd say as he went past ? 
he would „ wouldn't he ? 
yes . 
that's the farmhouse there next to the horse . 
and now we've got more houses there .
