so it looks like we've got to find the things that he had in his packed lunch .

this is a lovely book „ isn't it ? 
which of your friends at nursery like Bob_the_Builder , Thomas ?

Pilchard's Bob's cat .

because we're not ready yet . 
no . 
there's no point setting it now . 
alright then . 
before the timer runs out you've got to tell me who likes Bob_the_Builder at your nursery school . 
Muck Dizzy Scoop and Lofty are not at your nursery . 
they're Bob_the_Builder's machines . 
come on . 
does Anthony like Bob_the_Builder ? 
no . 
what about Luke ? 
Lofty . 
don't shake your head . 
say no .

don't do it again . 
otherwise we can't +... [+ N] 
no . 
we can't play the game if you're going to do that . 
right . 
you wanna shut the book . 
you don't wanna play it anymore . 
well look . 
according to this we've got Wendy's office . 
some houses . 
Bob's front room . 
missing parts of the machine . 
Bob's birthday cake . 
that looks exciting . 
no . 
have you seen an episode of Bob_the_Builder where that happens ? 
does she make a birthday cake ? 
yes . 
Spud eats the icing „ does he ? 
well let's have a little look and see if we can find that in this book . 
no . 
we needn't do the stickers . 
let's just have a quick look . 
ah this is the one . 
Bob's birthday cake . 
well we're not going to do that now „ are we ? 
but &-uh . 
so it (h)as been on television „ has it . 
one where somebody pinches the icing off the cake . 
ah that's naughty „ isn't it ? 
it's a very nice thought „ isn't it ? 
right . 
well that +... [+ N] 
do you wanna see Mummy's timer ? 
what timer ? 
have you ? 
and what do you use that for , Thomas ? 
oh can you ? 
so what happens ? 
you're all given a drink . 
and does Miss_Ashworth and Miss_Lonsdale set the timer ? 
oh I see . 
so you have your drink when the timer has run out . 
you don't mean that she sets the timer when you +... [+ N] 
Thomas , watch the cloth . 
watch the cloth . 
no [/] no [/] no . 
yes . 
but you mustn't pull the cloth off . 
stop shouting . 
I make you tired . 
I've made your stack look silly . 
well you make the table look silly when you drag the cloth on the floor . 
xxx . 
oh Thomas , can we never do a tape without your crying ? 
nobody wants +... [+ N] 
you don't want a tape . 
well nobody wants to listen to you crying . 
right . 
what's this ? 
a chocolate bar . 
no . 
it's not a chocolate bar „ is it ? 
it's sposta be a Christmas pudding with ice +/. [+ N] 
it's ding a linging@c . 
with icing on the top and some holly . 
it's sposta be a Christmas pudding . 
and look . 
it's a timer . 
you turn the top from the bottom and it starts ticking . 
ticktock [/] ticktock . 
can you hear it ? 
ticktock [/] ticktock [/] ticktock . 
and look . 
when it gets to the right time it goes ding^a^ling^a^ling@o . 
but this is a kitchen timer . 
let's just set it for those couple of minutes and it'll ring . 
can you still hear it ticking ? 
and if you look very carefully . 
then the top is turning round that way . 
the bottom stays where it is . 
and the top's turning round . 
and in a minute xxx [//] it'll run out of time and it will ring . [+ I] 
a bit like an alarm clock . 
can you still hear it ? 
ticktock [/] ticktock [/] ticktock . 
it's tick tocking@c very quickly „ isn't it ? 
and you're playing with the timer on the Bob_the_Builder book „ aren't you ? 
right . 
just leave it a lone a second . 
ah ! 
did that make you jump ? 
it's like an alarm clock „ isn't it ? 
well somebody gave that to Mummy a long time ago . 
and it's a Christmas one . 
and we'll use it on Christmas_Day . 
yes . 
because on Christmas_Day the oven's very [/] very busy . 
it (h)as got turkey and sausages and bacon . 
and on top of the cooker we've got gravy and brussel sprouts and carrot . 
&=laughs . 
we've got stuffing . 
we've got roast potatoes . 
we've got creamed potatoes . 
we've got cranberry sauce . 
all sorts of things at Christmas . 
so we'll leave that time so Mummy knows what she's doing . 
it's like Nana and Grandad's alarm clock „ is it ? 
do they have an alarm clock with a bell like that ? 
because Mummy doesn't have one will a bell „ does she ? 
Mummy's alarm clock when it comes on it's the radio „ isn't it ? 
the radio just starts working and when it's time for Mummy to get up . 
have you noticed that ? 
the radio comes on . 
well it is because you've turned it round . 
this is quite an old timer . 
oh no . 
it'll ring in a second . 
when it rings again we'll put it away „ shall we ? 
so at nursery do you all hafta wait for the timer to go off [//] before you can have your drink ? 
and then does she set it again once you start drinking ? 
have you got so long to drink your drink ? 
and then when the alarm goes off is it drinks down ? 
oh I see . 
when [/] when drinks are finished you have a biscuit . 
then you go outside . 
it seems a funny way round that . 
because I would have thought you need a drink after a biscuit „ don't you ? 
biscuits for snacks . 
no . 
but I mean do you get your drink after you've had your biscuit or do you get your biscuit after you've had your drink . 
oh that seems funny . 
is your throat not dry after having a biscuit ? 
no . 
well it will in a minute I think . 
because the [/] the little arrow is pointing at the nought „ isn't it ? 
and did you turn it all the way round to the very end ? 
which is an hour . 
well if you've turned it round there . 
it (h)as got to go that way . 
xxx . 
so we shouldn't really play with it . 
we'll let it ring again . 
so are you given a drink and a biscuit at the same time ? 
do you just choose to have your drink first and then your biscuit ? 
&=laughs . 
so it's you doing it a funny way round . 
not the teacher . 
I don't know , Thomas . 
what are we going to do with you ? 
and what did you have at nursery today ? 
nothing . 
you did . 
oh ! 
that really frightened Mummy then . 
did it frighten you ? 
be careful with it , darling . 
it's not a toy . 
that's it . 
actually we should set this when we're doing our tapes because sometimes we're a bit hopeless and forget how long we've been taping for „ don't we ? 
no . 
that's right . 
so what do you do ? 
you have your snack . 
you're not fast asleep . 
no , Thomas . 
because this won't ring for absolutely ages . 
and I wanna talk to you in the mean time . 
you're snoring now . 
do you then go outside and play ? 
what do you play on ? 
no . 
don't be naughty , Thomas . 
okay . 
well look . 
we'll read the Tweenies one . 
this is about time as well . 
it's a Tweenies's party time . 
tell the time with the Tweenies@q . 
now where's the seven on the clock , Thomas ? 
to make it seven o'clock . 
on this clock . 
the little hand needs to go to the seven . 
that's right . 
and the big hand when it's at o'clock +... [+ N] 
on the hour . 
the big hand hasta go to the twelve . 
that's seven o'clock „ isn't it ? 
very [/] very good . 
right . 
shall I wipe your nose ? 
no sniffing . 
that's what Milo says „ isn't it ? 
right . 
to make it eight o'clock we need the little hand to go from the seven to the eight . 
the [/] the big hand can stay where it is „ can't it ? 
very good . 
eight [//] eight's that one „ isn't it ? 
oh right . 
we needta move it again to nine o'clock . 
which is the next one along . 
that's it . 
just the little one that moves (.) to the nine . 
do you remember that party we went to at [>] play group that xxx in the summer with that little girl ? [+ I] 
oh yes . 
gosh that's funny „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
we've just been reading about a cake in the Bob_the_Builder book . 
are we going to make that clock ten o'clock ? 
just the little one that moves to number ten . 
not the big one . 
just the little hand . 
no . 
that one back to seven . 
where's ten ? 
the one and the nought is ten . 
one and zero . 
ten . 
very good . 
it's ten o'clock . 
right . 
I'm afraid it (h)as changed now to eleven o'clock . 
so if you'd like to move the little hand to eleven . 
oh well done . 
what [//] how does the eleven look ? 
two and a two . 
it's two ones „ isn't it ? 
how have they decorated the cake ? 
what's on the cake ? 
very nice . 
it's a superb cake that . 
it (h)as got icing and it's covered in Smarties chocolate biscuits . 
chocolate finger biscuits and other biscuits „ isn't it ? 
it's twelve o'clock says Milo . 
right would you like to move the little hand up to join the big one ? 
so they're both on the number twelve „ aren't they ? 
that's it . 
they're both pointing straight up to the sky . 
yes . 
when they're pointing like that it's either noon . 
lunchtime . 
or it's midnight when all little boys and girls [>] should be in bed . 
well it could be midnight but I think in this story it's sposta be midday . 
around lunchtime . 
trust Milo to wanna eat . 
it's all he wants to do „ isn't it ? 
eat . 
he wants to eat the cake . 
so this time the big hand still stays at number twelve but the little hand moves round to number one . 
it's one o'clock now . 
hello , Bella . 
right . 
now you can move the little hand to two please . 
just the little one . 
that's very good . 
that's it . 
next to the one . 
what sort of party games do you think they're making ? 
they're doing something that we had at your party there , Thomas . 
look . 
do you remember pining the tail on the donkey ? 
Sophie's blowing up balloons . 
look . 
which Tweenie is this ? 
Fizz . 
Fizz is doing something . 
oh she's probably wrapping up presents for Pass_the_Parcel . 
Fizz is doing Pass_the_Parcel . 
Bella's doing Pin_The_Tail_On_The_Donkey . 
and Milo's doing the balloons . 
oh no . 
that's the tail for the donkey „ isn't it ? 
who's that holding the balloon ? 
is that just the little man holding the clock ? 
so that we can see what time it is . 
right . 
we needta move this little hand round again . 
just to three . 
where's the number three on the clock , Thomas ? 
that's number three . 
very good . 
that's right . 
we went past . 
but we can go back . 
excellent . 
look at that . 
that's three o'clock . 
oh look at the time now on my clock in the kitchen . 
our clock is five minutes to three . 
in another five minutes the big hand in our kitchen clock will have matched this clock here . 
look . 
ah ha now we needta move the clock to number four now , Thomas . 
because +... [+ N] 
well done . 
so we'll move this one to number five . 
very good . 
now we get to six o'clock . 
that's it . 
that's six o'clock when the big hand's on the twelve at the top and the little hand's on the six at the bottom . 
morning time . 
well if it's morning time you're back to the beginning of the book for seven o'clock to get up „ aren't you ? 
now we've got a +//. [+ N]

the hands are already turned on this book .

there's probably about fifty in that clump . 
let's have them . 
you are cheeky .

what do you say when I give you raisins ? 
oh no . 
you don't say you're too busy . 
I'll have one now if you're being rude . 
what do you say when I give you something ? 
you don't just say there you go . 
I know when I give you things I say there you go . 
but oh Thomas .

on Tuesdays and Thursdays what happens at four o'clock ? 
who comes to pick you up from Missus_Blackhurst ?

come away from the fire . 
whereas the number five ? 
one [<] two three four five . 
no . 
if you go past five you'll miss teatime . 
and you know what teatime means . 
so turn the clock to six o'clock . 
no . 
that's seven . 
you've gone past it . 
no . 
I know you're messing about . 
but listen . 
you know your numbers one two and three .

can you show me where number five is ? 
oh yes . 
very clever . 
number ten . 
where's number ten ?

so six o'clock . 
does that mean six more raisins ?

let's put the pot back on your head . 
that was just a practice „ wasn't it ? 
right .

because this time if it falls out raisins have got to come out . 
I've got to eat them . 
that's it . 
very still . 
we'll pop them in the pot . 
count . 
six [<] . 
and that's for being a good boy . 
in your mouth .

here you are . 
six raisins for six o'clock .

now you've done very well there because Pooh_Bear doesn't have breakfast till nine o'clock . 
whereas the others had them at seven and eight . 
so you get one [//] more raisins .
