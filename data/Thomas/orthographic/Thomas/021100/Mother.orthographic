I'm cleaning the Welsh_Dresser .

I've got to do some repairs on [/] on something . 
you needta play with them . 
you can have a look at this . 
this is a kaleidoscope . 
right . 
do you know what you do with a kaleidoscope ? 
do you ? 
you look through that hole there . 
point it towards the light . 
and turn it round and round and you'll see lots_of different shapes . 
just let me see it's not too dark that way . 
I'll turn your chair round so you're facing the light . 
because it's better to shine it at the light . 
right . 
you look at that with one eye . 
one eye . 
no . 
you're putting it on your nose , darling . 
just one eye . 
what can you see down there ?

just look through that . 
not too close .

pretty beads „ aren't they ? 
you can see a daffodil . 
oh yes . 
that's a lovely daffodil „ isn't it ? 
that's funny . 
right . 
for being a good boy would you like some jelly babies ? 
I know you like jelly babies . 
it's a little treat to have some though „ isn't it ? 
but then you've been a good boy using your potty „ haven't you ? 
so when you're a good boy you get a reward . 
let's just give you a green one . 
you haven't got a green one . 
how's that ? 
black yellow orange red and green . 
I'll move you back this way now . 
I was going to get the glue out because +//. [+ IN] 
+, when I've been washing the pots from the Welsh_Dresser +//. [+ IN] 
+, I've taken down the coffee pot and inside of the coffee pot is this . [+ IN] 
and it's the lid of the coffee pot . 
and I remember now that a long [/] long time ago we broke the lid and we didn't bother sticking it together . 
but I've just found it now so +... [+ IN] 
it's like doing a jigsaw , Thomas . 
we're going to hafta try and find out where all the little pieces go [>] . 
it's more like a sausage . 
so it might take me a few minutes to do it . 
and I've got to be very careful I don't get my fingers glued together . 
that wouldn't be any good „ would it ? 
oh now that piece goes there . 
it's very sticky . 
what happened I was watching Aunty_Mabel the other day . 
at least you were watching Aunty_Mabel and I glanced at it . 
well what was the one about the tea pot ? 
what had happened ? 
oh dear . 
the glue (h)as snapped . 
the lid of the glue (h)as snapped . 
Tippin [//] Pippin broke a new tea pot „ did he ? 
well I think +... [+ IN] 
was the tea pot not a birthday present to Aunty_Mabel from her nephew ? 
and the nephew was coming for a cup of tea „ wasn't he ? 
and Pippin +... [+ IN] 
I don't know what happened but somehow when Aunty_Mabel was undoing all her birthday presents Pippin got in the way . 
and the tea pot was knocked over and smashed . 
and she desperately needed to get one just the same before her nephew came „ didn't she ? 
pardon . 
who's a silly woman ? 
why ? 
nephew . 
well you're a nephew . 
you're Uncle_David's nephew and Aunty_Patty's nephew . 
I don't know whether this is going to stick , Thomas . 
you think so not . 
I don't think it is actually . 
have they got some buttons ? 
so Aunty_Mabel +... [+ IN] 
we're going back to this Aunty_Mabel story now . 
she wanted to buy a new teapot so that her nephew wouldn't know that she had broken it . 
she went to the shop and they hadn't got any in „ had they ? 
they (h)ad none left . 
and the lady said I can order one and Aunty_Mabel said +"/. 
+" that's no good . 
+" I've got to have one this afternoon . 
+" where did you get yours from ? 
she said +"/. 
+" we get ours from the factory . 
so what was the next thing that Aunty_Mabel and Pippin did ? 
where did they go ? 
they went to the factory „ didn't they ? 
to see teapots being made . 
and cups and sugars@c . 
were they making cups and sugar basins at the same time . 
Thomas , that isn't nice . 
in fact +/. [+ IN] 
have [<] they ? 
I was just about to say I'll take the jelly babies off you for saying silly woman but you've eaten them „ haven't you ? 
well I don't think there'll be anymore if you say that again . 
it's not nice „ is it ? 
it's not a nice thing to say , Thomas . 
and this isn't sticking „ is it ? 
the nozzle of the glue tube snapped „ didn't it ? 
just as we started . 
oh no . 
perhaps we just needta leave it a long time . 
right now . 
we've got this . 
what is this ? 
it's a little crystal bunny rabbit . 
yes . 
you hold him very carefully . 
oh it (h)as got a tummy . 
it (h)as got a big tummy . 
it's an ear . 
he hasn't got one of his ears . 
it (h)as fallen off . 
I don't know why ? 
pardon . 
no . 
you haven't broken it . 
Isabel . 
no . 
Isabel didn't break it either , Thomas . 
I think it was something that got broken when we moved house . 
and I put it somewhere safe . 
and I've just found it . 
so I'm going to glue an ear back on to the bunny rabbit . 
it's only a tiny [/] tiny thing . 
we can't really see because there's no sunshine today . 
but these figures , Thomas . 
if you hold them up to the light +/. [+ IN] 
if you shine a light on it and put it in the sunshine all the pretty colors come through . 
you can't really see today because there isn't enough sun . 
right . 
I'll just have a look to see which way the ear needs to go . 
where does the ear needta go ? 
on there . 
right . 
I'll try and put it back again . 
I'll try . 
try not to not break it . 
it think it goes that way . 
right . 
there we are . 
oh dear , Dora . 
Pippin lost his suitcase . 
you're talking about another episode of Aunty_Mabel and Pippin „ aren't you ? 
and that's the one where +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
Aunty_Mabel and Pippin had been to stay with a friend called Dora and Pippin brought his suitcase . 
and Aunty_Mabel wrote when they got home +"/. 
+" thank you , Dora . 
+" for a nice time . 
+" but unfortunately Pippin (h)as lost his suitcase . 
+" can you send it to us ? 
Postman_Pat came with Pippin's suitcase . 
but I think that episode showed you what happens to all the post „ doesn't it ? 
it showed you the letter that Aunty_Mabel and Pippin had written going +//. 
on a railway train . 
that's right . 
they posted it in a postbox . 
and we saw the postman come in his van and empty the letterbox . 
and put the letter in his sack . 
and then he drove off . 
and it went to a sorting office „ didn't it ? 
do you remember those big machines ? 
that's right . 
and take all the letters away . 
and then after they had been sorted they went into bags . 
and they went to the railway station „ didn't they ? 
they went on the Royal_Mail train „ didn't they ? 
and then what happened ? 
they were sorted again „ weren't they ? 
and then the postman delivered it . 
look . 
the bunny rabbit's ear's better . 
can you see ? 
it doesn't look quite in the same place as the other one but I'm sure it is . 
we needta wait for the glue to dry now . 
there . 
how's that ? 
a little toy's behind my back . 
behind my bottom . 
oh yes . 
we've something else to mend „ haven't we ? 
and that is one of your toys . 
right . 
yes . 
it's this little church . 
look . 
it's one of your bits from the wooden train set . 
we've had two accidents with that so far „ haven't we ? 
Daddy trod on . [+ IN] 
one of the little carriages . 
the little yellow carriage . 
and then +/. [+ IN] 
not again . 
yes . 
and then this little . 
&-um I'm not sure whether that's a church or a school , Thomas . 
what do you think it is ? 
it's a church „ is it ? 
well whatever it is <the clock> [/] the clock came off a little while ago . 
and now the spire has come off . 
that's why I think it might be a little church . 
so we've already mended that once „ haven't we ? 
we've [/] we've repaired it once before . 
you needta have a go . 
well I wish somebody could have a go but +... [+ IN] 
ah that's where it goes to I suppose . 
that way . 
right . 
we know now „ don't we ? 
there . 
there's something else . 
we've got to just hold a few moments until the glue sets . 
that's good „ isn't it ? 
and then it'll all fit back together again like that „ won't it ? 
no Reverend_Timms in that church . 
no . 
I don't think there is „ is there ? 
there . 
it all fits back like that , Thomas . 
we've finally got it done „ haven't we ? 
now I'll hafta be very careful now with this glue . 
because we need a lot of glue +//. [+ IN] 
a lot of glue everywhere . 
well we'll try not to get it everywhere . 
ah . 
where's the church ? 
now I'll stick that on +/. [+ IN] 
it's over here . 
did you throw it ? 
right . 
now we need +... [+ IN] 
this is the final piece of the jigsaw . 
Thomas , that's not nice . 
you've just said pick your nose lick it and put it on the table . 
now who an earth has said that to you ? 
an awful thing to say . 
do you know what I think as well ? 
I think the glue's empty . 
the tube of glue is almost empty before +/. [+ IN] 
oh I see what you're doing . 
you're picking your nose with the spire . 
still it isn't pleasant , Thomas „ is it ? 
it's really not nice at all . 
now what do you think to that ? 
what does Thomas think to that ? 
it is brilliant „ isn't it ? 
it's more like a what now ? 
a moon . 
oh . 
it was a bit +... [+ IN] 
gosh it's making my eyes sting . 
it was more like a moon when it was broken . 
it looked like half a moon „ didn't it ? 
a chocolate star . 
oh what a shame . 
we've run out of glue . 
look . 
before we've got the church done . 
perhaps that's why [/] why the container because it (h)as [/] it (h)as been used such a lot . 
it must have thought I'm fed up of being used . 
I'll hafta buy a new tube . 
you think so . 
you think you'll have a blue one . 
a blue what ? 
oh right . 
ah I see what you mean . 
do you wanna hold that ? 
that's the empty packet that the glue came in . 
I can't give you the actual container . 
that would be silly „ wouldn't it ? 
but I can give you the packet . 
right . 
look at that , Thomas . 
I've stuck the lid back together . 
isn't that clever ? 
what do you think to that ? 
have you still got the steeple ? 
where is it , darling ? 
oh right . 
we'll just see . 
I don't think there's enough glue but we'll just try our very best . 
we put a little too much glue on this head now it's running down the side . 
that's it . 
if we rub that on there . 
oh there , Thomas . 
what do you think to that ? 
you've broken that xxx . [+ PI] 
that doesn't matter . 
that's the empty packet the glue came in . 
look . 
it's stuck together straight away . 
there you are . 
that's quite alright . 
and that's the lid of the coffee pot . 
oops . 
&=laughs . 
which we've just dropped again but luckily it didn't break . 
isn't that lovely . 
now we better leave all those things to try . 
that's three things [>] we've stuck together . 
you need the toy behind me . 
right . 
I'll just have a look and see what +/. [+ IN] 
an orange toy . 
oh that's a balloon , Thomas . 
you saw the balloon „ did you ? 
I've got a feeling that was possibly in one of the flower vases on the Welsh_Dresser . 
&-um . 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
have you managed to blow it up ? 
oh you've got to be very careful blowing balloons up you don't hurt yourself . 
we've got some of the glue on the table „ haven't we ? 
that's right . 
it scrapes off . 
but when it's dry it isn't sticky anymore . 
it's just hard „ isn't it ? 
oh that's good . 
that's very clever , Thomas . 
you're managing to blow it quite a +/. [+ IN] 
do you ? 
you've got a yellow one white one and a green one . 
the yellow one and the white one are long like sausages . 
but the orange and green one are ordinary balloons „ aren't they ? 
ordinary shapes . 
a balloon shape . 
it's only I'm scrubbing that and it's making a noise but we needta get it off the table „ don't we ? 
there we are . 
how's that ? 
I'm very pleased with that . 
I think we've done a good job there , Thomas . 
no . 
they're not broken .

there we are . 
would you like to blow the balloon now ? 
they're nice colors these „ aren't they ?

I can't blow [>1] up the yellow and white ones , Thomas [>2] . 
they're too +/. [+ IN] 
oh is it ? 
you're pretending the carpet (h)as got water on it . 
is it a pond or a stream or a river ? 
a river . 
oh I see . 
so the balloons could be fish „ couldn't they ? 
in the river . 
oh that tastes absolutely horrible . 
I'm not blowing that . 
no . 
I can never do these . 
no . 
I'm sorry . 
I can't taste that . 
I'm not doing that one because it tastes terrible . 
I didn't like it at all . 
ugh ! 
xxx . 
no . 
I can't do it , Thomas . 
I need the balloon pump . 
I don't know what it is about those long sausage shaped balloons but you need lots_of breath to blow them up . 
and I never seem to manage it . 
so are those fish in the sea ? 
there we are . 
that little rabbit's +/. [+ IN] 
it's a crane on the water „ is it ?

the building site one . 
the building site crane .

what are you going to do now ? 
well I think you wanted to look at this „ didn't you ? 
when we sat down before . 
I'll just make sure the table's dry after that . 
before we spread this out . 
oh what's this ?

I don't know how that (h)as got water on it . 
never mind . 
now look . 
they're wet on the tummys . 
it's the Teletubbies „ isn't it ? 
if we just leave it flat , Thomas .
