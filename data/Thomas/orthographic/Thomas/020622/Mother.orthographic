Dobbin's a rocking horse „ isn't he ? 
it says not suitable for children under thirty six months . 
as certain products may contain small parts and could prove hazardous causing choking if swallowed . 
well you're not thirty six months yet , Thomas .

Mummy saw this in her bedroom and she said to Grandma “oh please could I take the monkey back with me because Thomas likes monkeys” . 
I useta play with this when I was a little girl . 
so it's a very old monkey now „ isn't it ? 
I think he actually needs a bit of a clean up , Thomas . 
ah . 
look the monkey is picking up all the letters . 
ah . 
oh he didn't mean to throw it . 
that was an accident . 
he (h)as got four paws you see .

but they're not letters of the alphabet . 
they're letters [>] and cards and parcels . 
post . 
ah now what's this ? 
this is n@l .

the letter n@l is painted yellow .

look let me draw some . 
they're called crochets and quavers .

we can sing baa baa black sheep . 
because every drawing like that represents a different sound .

Old_MacDonald_had_a_farm .

we don't know the name of that tune „ do we ? 
it sounds a little bit like London bridge is falling down again . 
oh , Thomas . 
when you were a baby you carried that octopus absolutely everywhere with you . 
and it looked so smart . 
because a lot of the babies had them . 
and some of them had had octopus that other babies had had .

is it stuck ? 
is it no playing anymore ? 
look . 
there's the king . 
dressed in blue .

oh , Thomas . 
you're going to be upset . 
guess what s@l is ? 
it's another snake . 
another snake . 
they could have done s@l for sheep „ couldn't they ? 
I think they could have put a sheep on that seeing as they've put an adder on a@l . 
guess what , Thomas ? 
I'm looking at this now wondering whether a@l is <actually an alligator> [>] . 
I think a@l is an alligator not a snake . 
I thought it was an adder .

no . 
z@l . 
what's that ? 
what's that ? 
no . 
it's not Gordon . 
you're thinking of Gordon one of the Thomas_The_Tank_Engine characters because it's green . 
it's a zebra painted black and white against a green background . 
hello , zebra . 
some people say zebra . 
zebra . 
is that what you're going to say ? 
zebra rather than zebra . 
I say zebra .
