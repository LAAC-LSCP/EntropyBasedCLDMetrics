Mummy (h)as brought a lot of bears down to look at today . 
you've got the Maypole with the bears . 
you've looked at your potty with the bears . 
and Aunty_Val and Stewart like teddy bears . 
this is why nearly everything they give you has teddy bears on .

that's really naughty . 
did you ? 
ah right . 
I shall hold you responsible for all the dust in the house .

when there's dust in the house you can have a bright yellow duster and a feather duster and you can go round and clean it all up . 
how's that ? 
would you be responsible for all the dusting ? 
no .

and it looked like a cat had killed a bird . 
there was so much white . 
it looked like feathers . 
but it was actually fur from the grey and white cat because this naughty ginger cat that we're feeding now had attacked him .

he is getting a bit pale „ isn't he ?

and the magpie's sitting on the fence now saying to the ginger pussy cat I shall get you . 
because normally pussy cats get birds but with magpies it's different . 
look . 
Ginger's having a look at the plant that bought Mummy for Mothers_Day . 
no . 
I don't think he's eating it . 
he's just having a sniff „ isn't he ? 
so them after [/] after the boy cats had had a fight Daddy went out to try to shoo them away . 
and we couldn't . 
we couldn't separate them „ could we ? 
and then we went for a walk and we saw the ginger pussy cat going home and the grey and white one going home . 
and we went to have a look „ didn't we ? 
to see where the grey and white one lived . 
we followed him home . 
because he was hurt „ wasn't he ? 
yes . 
Ginger's in the trees . 
what had happened to the grey and white pussy cat , Thomas ? 
in the fight . 
who's rolling [?] in your curtains ? 
yes . 
the grey and white pussy cat had been injured in the fight so we went to tell the owners „ didn't we ? 
but having said that I do think +/. [+ IN] 
the magpie . 
I think the magpie's saying to Ginger just stay away Ginger or I'll get you . 
I think that's what he's saying . 
you see the magpie's a pretty bird really xxx . [+ PI] 
I shall get you . 
he (h)as got +... [+ IN] 
can you see blue ? 
can you see blue on the magpie ? 
he's mainly black and white but he (h)as got blue feathers „ hasn't he ? 
bright blue or a deep blue . 
but you see Ginger's a naughty boy really . 
but if his owners looked after him a little bit more , Thomas . 
<he wouldn't> [/] he wouldn't fight and stray away from home . 
he [//] it's a shame . 
anyway enough of that . 
let's look at these bears . 
yes . 
these bears . 
now this is our favorite story „ isn't it ? 
this is the one on the tape . 
and it's called “Old_Bear” .

so shall we have him as Old_Bear ? 
pardon . 
one eye (h)as gone .

he's very old . 
shall we put him up there and pretend that's the attic ? 
so Old_Bear's sitting in the attic .

he did nearly fall down . 
we'll put him up now . 
pretend that's the attic .

that's Bramwell_Brown . 
that's Old_Bear . 
oh I hope you can remember all these names .

so this is Little_Bear . 
yes . 
so shall we get some little building bricks ? 
right . 
there you are . 
you're Little_Bear . 
you build the tower of bricks . 
I think that'll do for now . 
Bob_the_Builder needs lots_of bricks . 
right . 
they've made a little tower [>] . 
a big tower . 
right . 
will we get some more bricks ? 
there you are . 
that's all the bricks you can have . 
now what's going to happen when they've made the tower of bricks ? 
they're going to come crashing down . 
so is it the Little_Bear that's going to climb up there ? 
right . 
off he goes then . 
you let Little_Bear climb up . 
he's trying to reach big teddy up there . 
Old_Teddy in the attic .

it's Little_Bear building the big tower „ isn't it ? 
yes .

because that tower's really very high now „ isn't it ? 
there's lots more there . 
look .

that's all there is .

would you like to put rabbit on duck's shoulders like in the book ? 
this is Bramwell_Brown . 
he's having a nic^nic@c . 
and in the book we've got duck and rabbit . 
and look who's on top . 
Little_Bear . 
gosh that's tall . 
&=laughs . 
ah . 
and everyone fell down . 
bump . 
it's not fun . 
oh you think bouncing on the bed's fun . 
are you going to make the bears jump up and down ? 
the rabbit wobble wobbled then crashed down „ did he ? 
oh dear dear . 
I wonder what the next idea is to try and reach the Old_Bear in the attic . 
ah look . 
duck . 
ah duck felt very sad . 
listen at duck quacking . 
duck's quacking because he's very sad . 
oh look at the picture . 
what's Bramwell_Brown doing to duck ? 
he's stroking . 
and he (h)as got a tissue to wipe duck's little eyes . 
look . 
ah . 
did he ? 
Little bear went tumbling down on Mummy's head . 
crash . 
we haven't really got a plant „ have we , Thomas ? 
so shall we pretend these flowers could be a plant . 
look . 
up he goes . 
up he goes . 
right . 
can Bramwell catch him ? 
you hold Bramwell . 
you hold Bramwell and Little_Bear comes +//. [+ IN] 
comes crash . 
oh Bramwell (h)as caught him . 
look at that . 
like a baby . 
that's right . 
we've got a little aeroplane down here „ haven't we ? 
we've a big wooden one . 
the wooden train set . 
do you think they'd have used the wooden train set to try and rescue Little bear ? 
here you are . 
here's the little toy plane . 
now what happens ? 
where's the propeller ? 
where's the propeller , Thomas ? 
that's right . 
so here's Bramwell_Brown . 
you let Bramwell help you . 
who's inside the plane ? 
it's rabbit and Little_Bear „ isn't it ? 
do you think there's room for rabbit and little bear in that plane ? 
right [<] . 
there's rabbit . 
there's Little_Bear . 
and look . 
here's Bramwell . 
oh dear . 
your building fell over . 
look . 
Bramwell's winding up the propeller . 
and the plane took off . 
up and up they went . 
no . 
well there should be . 
look . 
look at the picture . 
look it's +/. [+ IN] 
look . 
it's Little_Bear and the bunny rabbit that have gone up to the attic „ isn't it ? 
it is high up „ isn't it ? 
so obviously the rabbit must go back down the plane and just leave Little bear to go into the attic . 
oh look . 
he's opening the attic door . 
what have we got +... [+ IN] 
we call our attic a loft „ don't we ? 
what have we got in our loft ? 
your baby things . 
we've got the pram „ haven't we ? 
and your baby walker . 
what else have we got ? 
did we put the Christmas decorations up there ? 
and suitcases after our holiday . 
<I think the> [/] I think the rabbit will have flown back down now to see the other +//. [+ IN] 
+, bears . [+ IN] 
don't shout , Thomas . 
it's too noisy . 
it is high up . 
listen . 
what happens when the Old_Bear gets to the attic ? 
what does he say ? 
he whispers . 
he lifts up the trap door and what does he say ? 
any bears in here ? 
what did he hear ? 
a muffled +//. [+ IN] 
a muffled 0 [=! Makes a noise] . 
and who do you think it was ? 
I think it was Old_Bear . 
look . 
Old_Bear's sitting down among the books . 
here he is . 
it was Old_Bear . 
what's Little_Bear saying ? 
do you know what the parachutes are made from ? 
handkerchiefs . 
ah [<] ready . 
right . 
all these people downstairs . 
Bramwell_Brown and the rabbit and the duck .

which is this one . 
then we've got +... [+ IN] 
who's that there ? 
the rabbit . 
there's the rabbit . 
and then we've got duck . 
and we've got Little_Bear . 
and who are they all cuddling ? 
Mummy's Old_Bear . 
isn't that nice ? 
is that a story with a happy ending ? 
I think actually one of the other books we have that tells the story about Old_Bear tells a longer story than we've just told [>] . 
you need a wooden train set . 
you'd like to play with it on the table . 
<in the> [//] in [/] in the toy room . [+ SR] 
it's in the toy room „ is it ? 
in the toybox . 
I was just looking to see if we could find that Old_Bear story in here but I don't think we can . 
isn't that funny . 
listen , Thomas . 
there's a story called “Flossie and Ginger at the Seaside” . 
who do you think Ginger is in this storybook ? 
is that Ginger ? 
I don't know . 
we'll hafta find out who Ginger is [>] .

he's off . 
oh no . 
that's called “there were four in the bed” . 
oh that's not a nice story . 
oh here we are . 
+" Flossie and Ginger at the Seaside . 
Ginger must be that little teddy bear I think . 
yes . 
oh Thomas , you do make a lot of noise . 
<well I think when we listen to the story about Old_Bear> [<] on your tape recorder it may say +... [+ IN] 
do you know why they put Old_Bear in the attic ?

he (h)as only got one eye . 
one eye's missing . 
well can you see +//. [+ IN] 
+, all the straw in his head . [+ IN] 
he's very [/] very old „ isn't he ? 
well just like the old bear in this story the children loved Old_Bear but they were sometimes a little bit rough with him . 
and so somebody put him in the attic really just to give him a little rest . 
just so the children wouldn't be rough . 
unfortunately they'd forgotten about him . 
that's why he'd been in the attic so long . 
but when he came back down to the nursery +... [+ IN] 
when duck and rabbit and Bramwell and Little_Bear brought him down the children were older and they knew how to treat him more carefully . 
you've got to be gentle with things . 
you are actually very [/] very good really „ aren't you ? 
you need a sweet now . 
you need a sweet for being a good gentle boy „ do you ?

I don't think Daddy makes his bed either .
