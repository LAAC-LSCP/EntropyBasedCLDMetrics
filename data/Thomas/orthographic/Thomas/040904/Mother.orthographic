yes [>] ? 
pardon ? 
well I'm not quite sure what we do with it actually . 
&-um let's have a look . 
right (.) we can either do this with it (.) look . 
can either do that with it . 
or you can make a cross track one like that . 
okay ? 
I'm not quite sure how they've done that actually . 
oh I see . 
you can put +... [+ IN] 
right (.) let's have a look . 
how have they done that , Thomas ? 
&-um +... [+ IN] 
how have they managed to do that ? 
oh I see . 
that must come on to a piece of track that you've already got . 
is that what they're saying ? 
xxx . 
<that's fine> [<] . 
<that's fine> [>] . 
but I can't [>] +... [+ IN] 
just trying to see it from the picture how [/] how they can possible have done it . 
was there nothing else in the box , Thomas ? 
oh I see . 
so you can have a buffer at <that end> [>] . 
<and a buffer> [<] there . 
xxx I just +//. [+ IN] [+ PI] 
that's right . 
xxx then you put your other train track what you've got <already over here> [>] . [+ PI] 
or you can make a long one . 
okay . 
you want a train track first . 
okay (.) well you're very good at building xxx . [+ PI] 
why don't you build a xxx [>] ? [+ PI] 
oh I'll build some . 
we saw that in Tesco „ didn't we ? 
another time when we go , Thomas , we can (..) buy a bit more . 
but xxx +/. [+ IN] [+ PI] 
yes please . 
yeah . 
is that how you make a little song ? 
right (.) are you going to stop and we'll get the track out of the box . [+ PI] 
Thomas , are you okay ? 
oh dear . 
xxx the phone ? [+ PI] 
well when we go another time we'll see if we can perhaps get xxx . [+ PI] 
<some more> [?] xxx [<] . [+ PI] 
I don't think we need more &buff +//. [+ IN] 
we'll see when we've made this . 
we've got the engine shed +... [+ IN] 
so that stops the track there . 
we've got buffers +//. [+ IN] 
you've got two [>1] xxx you can make here [>2] . [+ PI] 
what did you say ? 
if Gordon was rushing through ? 
yes ? 
they had xxx like this „ didn't they ? [+ PI] 
they had more of a xxx type ones xxx today . [+ PI] 
xxx now xxx truck ones . [+ PI] 
like this one . [+ PI] 
xxx . 
I thought you'd been drawing on that but I think it must be more the &-uh (.) paint off the xxx . [+ PI] 
xxx Grandad some things to glue with wood . [+ PI] 
right (.) well let's get this ready (.) because (.) when we find that bit of xxx Grandad could glue this back on „ couldn't he ? [+ PI] 
was it from one of these that we got the turntable ? 
no . 
look (.) I am helping you . 
xxx helping you do this &-um (..) piece of something that's missing on these look . [+ PI] 
because I'm just thinking Grandad xxx or whatever it is he uses +... [+ IN] 
if Grandad could glue that back in then that would (.) &-uh (.) mend the track xxx „ won't it ? [+ PI] 
<on the phone> [<] ? 
it's no good asking xxx can't do it over the telephone „ can he ? [+ PI] 
I don't even know what it's come from though , Thomas . 
ah (.) yes I do . 
it's from there . 
right . 
okay . 
very good . 
now do you want it to come round in a continuous xxx +/. [+ IN] [+ PI] 
well that's what I mean . 
so there's no end . 
xxx that , darling . [+ PI] 
well I'll let you put things where you want . 
yes . 
turntable there . 
no but what I mean is if [//] to get the trains xxx [>] . [+ PI] 
yes ? 
well we've got the engine shed . 
that block [?] stays off „ doesn't it ? 
<that's right> [<] . 
yes . 
well yes it will do [?] . 
<what do you want it> [<] to go under that bridge ? 
you're doing very well actually , Thomas . 
xxx doing very well . [+ PI] 
that's it . 
right (.) what do you wanna do ? 
go [//] bring it round so it joins on on this end ? 
because there aren't any gaps in the track . 
you know how we usually have things run off the end ? 
<this is going to> [<] break , darling . 
it's too stretched there . 
that's going to break . 
yes (.) I think we needta use +... [+ IN] 
xxx „ don't you ? [+ PI] 
sorry [>] ? 
<I do> [<] . 
I think we need xxx . [+ PI] 
xxx snapped . [+ PI] 
there . 
xxx . 
I think really we could do with a bit of straight track . 
we keep buying bits but we never seem to ever have enough „ do we ? 
what have you done ? 
oh , Thomas . 
I can't say I had noticed but now that you've pointed it out +... [+ IN] 
oh [<] Thomas Lastname . 
xxx me . [+ PI] 
will it not go ? 
xxx stretch . [+ PI] 
<we needta do> [<] something else round here , Thomas , because this isn't going to work . 
we've got too many xxx . [+ PI] 
Thomas , that smell is absolutely vile . 
there that's better . 
great now „ isn't it ? 
xxx . 
right (.) now are you going to put the engine shed on that ? 
xxx [>] . 
it's here look . 
I'm just thinking if we brought [?] +... [+ IN] 
<you need> [>] +... [+ IN] 
you needta do +... [+ IN] 
how [<] are we going to do this ? 
we need that to go onto something . 
we might hafta +... [+ IN] 
that's it . 
ah yes xxx . [+ PI] 
xxx . 
do you think we'll hafta turn everything round ? 
is that what we hafta do [>] ? 
goodness me . 
I think with the rest we'll hafta use something else . 
xxx on there . [+ PI] 
not like this idea ? 
xxx [<] . 
we seem a bit stuck „ aren't we ? 
now the trouble is things are going to go flying off there , Thomas , as well . 
perhaps what we'll hafta do +... [+ IN] 
+, is do that and that changes xxx . [+ PI] 
this probably sounds very noisy (.) building this (.) on a wooden floor . 
wooden train track on a wooden floor . 
do you think it's a bit noisy ? 
is it ? 
what's the problem ? 
yes (.) well that's why the other buffer needs to go over there , Thomas . 
that's what I was <saying look> [>] . 
it's behind you . 
but then how are things going to drive over there ? 
look [<] it turns upside down like that . 
you don't want that xxx there . [+ PI] 
<do you> [<] ? 
xxx . 
right [<] . 
yes . 
look we've got +//. [+ IN] 
it's going to break here I think . 
it's too xxx „ isn't it ? [+ PI] 
right [<] by the time we've xxx [>] +... [+ IN] [+ PI] 
what's broken ? 
well that's on the end of that piece . 
put it back in . 
that's the piece I was saying you've got to save for your Grandad when he comes . 
haven't you ? 
what's the matter , Thomas ? 
<well you keep asking> [<] me that and everytime I tell you you say it's not going there . 
so don't ask me anymore . 
you know where it should go . 
well it should go on the other part of the buffer . 
yeah (.) it clicks onto this bit , Thomas . 
<that's the idea of it> [<] . 
xxx [<1] . 
<well that's what I mean> [<2] . 
this is where you keep asking me where it should go and when I tell you +... [+ IN] 
well don't ask me any more then . 
well you turn that piece round and that's where it goes . 
yes you turn that piece round and put it across ways . 
like I showed you . 
<oh , Thomas> [<] , stop whinging . 
well look (.) this didn't come with the set . 
take that +/. [+ IN] 
okay I won't play then . 
well that's fair enough . 
I'm sure you can work that bit . 
that xxx thing „ is it ? [+ PI] 
xxx . 
I know it is but you keep asking me where the buffer goes and I keep showing you . 
<look there's a spider> [<] on the floor there . 
xxx see it ? [+ PI] 
no it's only a tiny spider xxx . [+ PI] 
are you warm ? 
you feel very warm ? 
that's a good one . 
well done . 
well I think you needta join this end up otherwise you're going to have a crash . 
your trains are not going to be able to join up „ are they ? 
I think instead of that bit curving round there it needs to go (.) somehow out of that . 
it is a bit tricky . 
xxx [<] . 
but it's not going to join up „ is it ? 
do you ? 
fair enough . 
what's the matter ? 
your eye hurts ? 
right [<] . 
so really we could do with a bit more of the buffer thing „ couldn't we ? 
do you think we could do with more buffers , Thomas ? 
oh there's quite a lot to build today . 
one's [?] +... [+ IN] 
oh (..) xxx join this up . [+ PI] 
there's no xxx gaps in that track xxx [>] . [+ PI] 
xxx [<] gaps in the track it doesn't work . [+ PI] 
right (.) okay . 
just trying to think (.) where can you go ? 
we [//] we've got to join this end „ haven't we ? 
I think it's a little bit too long really . 
perhaps we needta (.) block it off earlier down there , Thomas . 
in which case we'll hafta take some of the track off there . 
okay ? 
thank you . 
it's not xxx . [+ PI] 
so we've got a double bridge now ? 
that'll work „ won't it ? 
are you sniffing ? 
why don't you go and get a tissue . 
why are you xxx . [+ PI] 
are they ? 
haven't got xxx . [+ PI] 
feel xxx . [+ PI] 
oh lordy [/] lordy . 
because I useta think it was quite good to make a train track . 
and now it's so hard . 
so very complicated . 
xxx . 
that xxx best bit to put the bridge „ wouldn't it ? [+ PI] 
do I ? 
guess what ? 
I've got it to work . 
but the only +... [+ IN] 
xxx [<] . 
<and then we xxx > [<] +... [+ IN] 
yes well I'm changing all that round . 
the only [/] the only other problem is that I have a cup of coffee which is probably cold by now . 
watch you don't bump into that because I don't want (.) a burnt leg on top of everything else . 
xxx . 
right . 
to move Purdie's bed . 
Thomas . 
get off my foot . 
right [?] . 
no [/] no . 
no I don't like that . 
why don't we move this bit over there ? 
oh [=! sighs] . 
no we can't <put a xxx over there> [>] . [+ PI] 
no because it won't work „ will it ? 
no . 
<no that> [<] , Thomas , that [//] it won't . 
it's broken at the track . 
well xxx . [+ PI] 
there . 
do you ? 
why are you going to break it up ? 
you're not ? 
you think what ? 
stuck ? 
oh [?] . 
I am stuck now . 
I am . 
well (.) I tried to tell you putting buffers there right in the middle of the track xxx [>] +... [+ IN] [+ PI] 
what [/] what xxx [>] . [+ PI] 
well where are you stuck ? 
this is the most complicated +... [+ IN] 
+, bit of engineering (.) we've every come across . 
isn't it ? 
<right we'll have> [<] to go onto the turntable . 
<because I can't think of any other way xxx > [<] . [+ PI] 
it still isn't joining up to anything , Thomas . 
oh this is hard . 
buffer there . 
buffers in the whatsits +... [+ IN] 
whatsits . 
it reminds me of the (.) &-uh (.) Thomas_The_Tank_Engine books . 
when he gets cross he says <oh my wheels and wipers> [?] and he says something like that „ doesn't he ? [+ PI] 
oh wheels and wipers . 
is that what he says ? 
yes (.) <and we'll needta put> [?] +... [+ IN] 
my windows blingoes@c ? 
what [=! laughs] +... [+ IN] 
what does that mean ? 
I don't know . 
is that Teletubbies come to play ? 
do you ? 
xxx . 
put that there „ can't we ? 
<are you> [<] ? 
right . 
and what do we do with that bit though , Thomas ? 
oh well <the &tr> [//] if I'm the train driver the track isn't my problem . 
what can we do with this ? 
am I ? 
whoops . 
<are you> [<] engineering ? 
putting a buffer there ? 
but then what +//. [+ IN] 
we don't xxx track any more . [+ PI] 
do we ? 
oh [=! sighs] dear [/] dear deary me . 
it's that little bit we needta get Grandad xxx . [+ PI] 
I didn't even notice that [=! laughs] . 
<I don't understand> [<] how +... [+ IN] 
we've got a few more pieces so I thought having more pieces would make it easier . 
<<no no> [/] no> [<] . 
now , Thomas , stop it . 
<no if you do that> [<] I'm going to sit in the chair and drink my coffee [>] . 
<well xxx > [<] trying to drive . [+ PI] 
<do you> [/] do you really [/] really want it to go under the bridge , Thomas ? 
I think (.) this is where our problem is . 
have we not got more buffers now ? 
because I just think (.) how are we gonna [: going to] end this ? 
well [<] the next time we go to Tesco then +... [+ IN] 
we've got [>] +... [+ IN] 
get another packet of buffers because that's what (.) we [/] we could do with if <we could> [>] +... [+ IN] 
well the two in the box +... [+ IN] 
that's got stuck . 
so I think we could certainly do with more buffers because then we could block off that turntable „ couldn't we ? 
and we could block that end off . 
right I don't think we're going to get a drive anywhere at all on this train track , Thomas . 
hm: &=laughs . 
we needta perhaps bring it round this way . 
it's got to go in a loop „ hasn't it ? 
but I can't drive . 
<I can't> [<] . 
I'll hit the buffer . 
Thomas , have you made another smell ? 
xxx that corner then +... [+ IN] [+ PI] 
<oh oh oh> [/] oh +... [+ IN] 
problem . 
what sort <of one [?]> [>] ? 
I know we've lost the carriages „ haven't we ? 
what [<] turn in [/] in to reverse and couple ? 
right . 
okay fine . 
de^diddly^dum@o [/] de^diddly^dum@o [/] de^diddly^dum@o [/] de^diddly^dum@o . 
oh I'm doing great now . 
de^diddly^dum@o [/] de^diddly^dum@o [/] de^diddly^dum@o [>] . 
no . 
oh [/] oh dear . 
oh dear . [+ SR] 
we had a problem getting over the bridge . 
right shall I try again ? 
I think it's too long . 
it's a bit of a strange train this . 
it's an express train . 
xxx me carry +//. [+ IN] [+ PI] 
0 [=! gasps] [>1] that many carriages [>2] . 
right Daddy's going out now , Thomas . 
do you wanna <go with Daddy> [>] ? 
can you see them ? 
are they ? 
xxx . 
right let's <have a look> [>] . 
don't climb too high . 
<well you'll> [<] see in a minute when they come [>] . 
what does it say ? 
oh (.) looks like this light's been going on and off . 
think the men will wave at you ? 
it isn't the same men . 
no we don't seem to have the same men . 
I don't know why . 
look xxx coming this way , Thomas . [+ PI] 
a different way . 
<you can see> [<] his brush and shovel on the side . 
I didn't know they had a brush and shovel . 
they don't use it at all . 
I was just thinking that the next time they make a mess I'll shout use your brush and shovel . 
we usually get the controls on the other side „ don't we ? 
right (.) you see he could use his brush and shovel now because he's dropped something . 
it looks like a piece of bread . 
oh [<] and some [//] a packet or something . 
off he goes . 
well let's hold on a moment . 
a tortoise ? 
xxx [<] Purdie „ isn't it ? [+ PI] 
what other one [>] ? 
pardon ? 
oh yes (.) it looks like a tortoise . 
it's just a bit of (.) &-uh (.) it's an old leaf that's gone (.) it's [//] that's [//] died . 
but I know what you mean . 
it's a big leaf and the way it's sort of turned round +... [+ IN] 
and there's Purdie . 
did you think that was a tortoise ? 
it looks like we've got a flashing orange light again , Thomas . 
<so I'm just going> [<] to stand here and watch a minute . 
I don't know which one it is . 
let me just turn one of the microphones off . 
oh it's that one . 
right it's this one (.) that's the problem . 
okay (.) so we keep an eye on it . 
okay (.) right (.) are we going to carry on with this train track ? 
come on (.) don't be silly , Thomas . 
no (.) it keeps flashing on . 
I'm going to go and stop the tape . 
okay ? 
I've just moved it round a little bit . 
I don't know if that'll make any difference (.) but &-uh +... [+ IN] 
no it's still flashing . 
there's really nothing I can do . 
we either spend all [//] the whole hour bothering about the orange light „ don't we ? [+ I] 
or we play . 
right (.) I hope you've not been sitting in Purdie's bed , Thomas . 
right (.) do you like this train track now I've sorted it out ? 
it's not a building site [>] . 
oh [<] fair enough . 
okay it can be a building site then . 
do you still want the crane ? 
yes ? 
so I hafta go and climb that ? 
oh well we'd better <go and> [>] +... [+ IN] 
well <we can't> [<] +... [+ IN] 
we can't have too many things out , Thomas . 
so [<] so if I just bring that bot Thomas box . 
is that what you want [>] ? 
well if I bring that bottom [>] +... [+ IN] 
is it not ? 
oh right (.) okay . 
alright . 
I find it funny [//] funnily enough (.) when I was vacuuming +... [+ IN] 
I thought something went up the vacuum but I couldn't work out what it was . 
and then when I emptied the vacuum cleaner bag (.) I just saw something silver shining and I looked (.) and it was this little hook off the crane . 
so I though (.) ah +... [+ IN] 
I know what it is now . 
did you know it had broken ? 
did you know it had gone missing though ? 
oh you didn't tell me „ did you ? 
yes . 
which character's that , Thomas [>] ? 
Rolly ? 
well you've got a &Roll +//. [+ IN] 
oh no (.) it's <a Dizzy> [//] a Mixer . 
it's a Rolly that „ is it ? 
Rolly the steam roller . 
look at the size of it compared to the mixer . 
right (.) I'm just trying to [>] +... [+ IN] 
Mickey ? 
is it ? 
oh shush , Thomas . 
no (.) don't make too much noise . 
Thomas ! 
that's very [/] very loud . 
right there we are . 
I've managed to tie it back on . 
are you ? 
so why has the train track suddenly become a building site ? 
I don't understand that [>] . 
oh I see (.) because one of the wooden (.) &-um (.) rails has got a tiny track [//] &-uh crack (.) so you decided to turn the whole think into a building site „ did you ? 
oh it's a train track but you need some building machines to repair it ? 
is that correct [>] ? 
I see . 
you know when you went out with Daddy ? 
just after you'd gone (.) I came back through here +... [+ IN] 
and I thought (.) oh that's what I needta do with the train track . 
you know we were having great problems trying to fix it up ? 
well that's better now „ isn't it ? 
because we've [/] we've got (.) &-um (.) two lots_of buffers +... [+ IN] 
and we've got this thing . 
we've got an engine shed . 
so there's no bit of the track where a train can come off . 
it either goes into the shed (.) goes on the turnstile or hits two buffers . 
<but did you alter> [<] this bit of it ? 
<xxx bit> [<] . [+ PI] 
you altered it ? 
how did you alter it ? 
oh I see . 
before did I have it joined up to there ? 
doesn't matter though . 
it looks very good . 
doesn't it ? 
I'm pleased about that . 
so what are you doing now , Thomas ? 
you're building ? 
what are you building ? 
you're mending a crack . 
what's the matter , darling [>] ? 
what is it ? 
right (.) well that's obviously been holding something together „ has it ? 
oh well don't pull it off . 
right (.) yes (.) we were using that to mend the front of the truck „ weren't we ? 
very good . 
yeah (.) it wasn't easy to mend . 
and I had a real problem with it before . 
right . 
oh , Thomas [/] Thomas . 
<shh@o shh@o> [/] shh@o . 
don't make such a lot of noise . 
right . 
these are the wooden trees from the train track . 
right were you clearing the line ? 
I [<] see . 
I thought you were clearing the line . 
do you remember that last storm [>] ? 
yes . 
that's right (.) because <you're bringing> [?] Bob_The_Builder toys out now „ aren't you ? 
<Scoop (.) Muck and Dizzy and Rolly too> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
<Lofty and Wendy> [=! singing] +//. [+ IN] [+ R] 
is that Lofty ? 
I didn't realize we had one of everything . 
I mean they're all from different places „ aren't they ? 
it looks as if the (..) the Scoop and the Muck of the same make as they're the same sort of size . 
the Dizzy's a little bit smaller . 
and the poor steam roller and [/] and Lofty are tiny „ aren't they ? 
<Scoop (.) Muck and Dizzy and Rolly too> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
<Lofty and Wendy join the crew> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
we [//] we've got a Wendy I'm sure „ haven't we ? 
I know we've got a tiny Bob_The_Builder . 
Pilchard ? 
we've got a Pilchard . 
have we got a Wendy ? 
no (.) just a Bob ? 
Thomas ! 
<just listen [/] listen> [<] . 
listen Daddy's just been telling you (.) please [>] +... [+ IN] 
shh@o [<] . 
please keep your voice down . 
look [<] you're being watched through the window . 
this could be Wendy . 
<wanna> [>] +... [+ IN] 
do you wanna let Wendy in ? 
she's [<] [/] she's really called Purdie but we call her Wendy . 
come on , Wendy . 
she won't hear you . 
come on (.) the door's open . 
perhaps she doesn't wanna come in . 
she'll come if she wants to , Thomas . 
I think she can see that we're +... [+ IN] 
<we've opened &-um> [<] +... [+ IN] 
<look she's> [<] [/] she's +... [+ IN] 
yeah she's coming now . 
took her a while to realize . 
<here she comes> [>] . 
<let her in , Thomas> [<] . 
Thomas , <let her in> [>] . 
hello [<] Wendy . 
what other characters are there , Thomas ? 
there's Spud +... [+ IN] 
who +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
Thomas . 
who's Spud ? 
is Spud the scarecrow ? 
and what about the bird ? 
what's the bird called ? 
no it's not called Purdie . 
I mean on Bob_The_Builder what's the bird called ? 
Birdie ? 
Birdie ? 
<oh is> [<] +... [+ IN] 
it's not called Purdie [>] . 
I don't think +... [+ IN] 
shh@o , Thomas . 
right here you are . 
this crane is mended now . 
and is that all the characters ? 
what about Farmer_Pickles ? 
<we haven't> [<] +... [+ IN] 
we haven't got a Farmer_Pickles „ have we ? 
or a Wendy . 
Thomas , I'm a little bit worried that the noise of some of these machines will mean that Jeannine won't be able to listen to what we're saying . 
the noise and the machines especially on a wooden floor . 
so I built this train track while you were out and we're not even playing with it now „ are we ? 
are we ? 
right (.) okay (.) well what do you want me to do ? 
do they ? 
remember that nice story I read last night <about the little> [>] yellow digger ? 
and what was the man with the plan ? 
do you remember the man with the plan ? 
what did he keep doing ? 
he did . 
he had a tea break (.) lunch break . 
he had a coffee break . 
<he did> [<] . 
a coffee break (.) a tea break (.) lunch (.) a snooze . 
and then all of a sudden he was a man without the plan because he was there without his plans . 
and what were they building in the end ? 
you don't remember ? 
splish splash xxx . [+ PI] 
a swimming pool . 
that's right . 
well I'm not breaking the whole thing up . 
well where can we have this ? 
was this for the end before ? 
okay . 
will do . 
if we had one more piece +... [+ IN] 
we could have made another little link „ couldn't we „ there ? 
when you came back with Daddy did you play with Daddy at all ? 
I don't understand this because I thought when I'd made it there weren't any gaps at all . 
were there some gaps still ? 
I don't know how . 
do you want me to carry on rebuilding it ? 
goodness me . 
and do I get any help from Bob_The_Builder's xxx [>] ? [+ PI] 
oh [>] . 
right . 
they're just any builders „ are they ? 
not necessarily Bob_The_Builder . 
the machine in the way . 
there you are . 
how's that ?
