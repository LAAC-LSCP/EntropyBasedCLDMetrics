Percy is hurrying to help and before you can say chuf^chuf@o the sheep is back in the field . 
and Kiera's Mummy and Daddy are brought safely by Thomas and one of his carriages . 
which might be Annie or it might be Clarabel . 
Clarabel . 
so +/. [+ N] 
right (.) so let's start again . 
another busy day at the station . [+ R] 
Kiera's Mummy and Daddy +//. [+ N] 
where are Kiera's Mummy and Daddy going to wait ? 
you put the sticker where you think they should be waiting . 
do you ? 
do you not think they're going to be waiting at the station ? 
the station's there . 
oh look (.) there's a lamp post there . 
that [//] shall we leave that on the platform ? 
didn't realize that was a sticker . 
they've been visitting the guard who's their friend . 
there's the guard (.) look . 
are they ? 
now they're ready to go home but there are no trains . 
Bertie_the_Bus is not there either . 
where's Bertie ? 
where's the sticker with Bertie ? 
there [<] he is . 
the fat controller asks Harold_the_Helicopter to help look for Thomas and his friends . 
where's Harold_the_Helicopter ? 
have we got that sticker ? 
no . 
oh that must be one of the ones that are missing (.) because there are a few that are missing . 
oh no (.) there is a sheep on the line . 
let's find a sheep and pop it on the line . 
ah there are the sheep (.) look . 
where [>] +... [+ N] 
oh guess what ? 
there isn't just one sheep . 
there's another sheep [>] . 
it does sound like a firework that [>] „ ? 
they start very early round here the fireworks . 
there's going to be a big crash because of the sheep on the line ? 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine (h)as bashed onto the station door ? 
it's not very good „ is it ? 
oh it says Percy's going to help and before you can chuff^chuff@o the sheep is back in the field . 
and the passengers +//. [+ N] 
that's Kiera's Mummy and Daddy are brought home safely by +/. [+ N] 
Thomas and [<] +... [+ N] 
Clarabel or Annie ? 
there's a little man [>] , Thomas . 
where do you think he's fishing ? 
do you think he's sitting on that big rock fishing ? 
oh [<] is that because of the wind ? 
goodness me . 
now shall we put a nice [<] street lamp there ? 
because then it will light the way for passengers waiting at the station . 
and also so that the guard [>] . 
is it a very windy day then „ is it ? 
at the station ? 
what sort of thing is this , Thomas ? 
is this (..) a storage tank ? 
has it got water in it ? 
or [<] +... [+ N] 
what's that used for ? 
I don't know either but it looks like it's a very important part of the +/. [+ N] 
ah (.) I see . 
is that somewhere near the stream then ? 
and it sucks the water up from the stream ? 
and then what does it do ? 
do you [<] think they use it for washing the trains [//] the carriages ? 
well we better put that [>] +... [+ N] 
Thomas ? 
very late ? 
I don't know . 
oh ! 
gosh (.) look there's [*] some boulders on the line now . 
and a lamp post . 
all these things have blown down . 
can you see the little man in his boat ? 
is he (..) sailing to the river ? 
oh no . 
&=laughs . 
the man sailing in the river ? 
the wind blew him on the track as well ? 
gosh (.) no wonder the poor passengers are having problems getting home . 
oh no . 
oh dear . 
and what about the guard here waving his flag ? 
where's he ? 
he could be here . 
oh no . 
let me guess . 
the engine [<] called Ben . 
he fell on as well ? 
and there's only one engine left (.) Toby . 
and let me guess what happens to him . 
oh no . 
he (h)as landed on top of all the others . 
0 [=! gasps] . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
Cranky_the_Crane came ? 
ah I bet he lifts them all up „ doesn't he ? 
is he going to rescue everybody ? 
oh no . 
and do you know while [/] while all this is happening +/. [+ N] 
there is a little man [<] sitting on the rock fishing . 
and the wind (h)as not affected him at all „ has it ? 
what's that that (h)as just blown off now ? 
that's [//] that's one of the (..) &-uh trucks „ isn't it ? 
the coal trucks . 
but the little man is still fishing . 
oh no . 
nobody can help . 
oh dear . 
a sheep that looks like it's upside down . 
do you know what happens to sheep , Thomas ? 
if you [<] see sheep in the field on their back +/. [+ N] 
you've got to turn them round the right way . 
(be)cause sheep can't get up on their own . 
and if ever you see a sheep lying in the field upside down you must shout@q . 
because they need help to turn over . 
they can't turn over . 
you would like [<] a drink ? 
yes . 
in a few minutes we can have a drink . 
can you see the big ladders leading up to Cranky ? 
well [//] I would imagine +/. [+ N] 
yes . 
I would imagine the step ladders go from the ground up to Cranky_the_Crane's (..) &-um (..) cab . 
because [//] the crane is such a long way up the driver needs to climb into the cab „ doesn't he ? 
the legs of the crane are a long way from the floor . 
and then when [<] the driver's in the cab the crane part goes up a long [/] long way above the cab „ doesn't it ? 
oh you can be driver and I can sit next to you and tell you what we hafta lift up . 
right , crane driver , there's an awful mess . 
we had strong winds in the night and all sorts of things have blown onto the line . 
&-um (.) I think we need help to lift Thomas_The_Tank_Engine up . 
you lift him . 
one at time (be)cause we can only manage one thing . 
up he goes . 
up [/] up . 
oh_gosh . 
you're a strong crane because apart from Thomas_The_Tank_Engine we've lifted up (..) Annie or Clarabel (.) and the big water storage tank with a man on the side . 
what else have you lifted up , Cranky ? 
oh we've rescued Toby (.) look . 
what else have you rescued ? 
ah who's this ? 
Ben . 
the engine called Ben that we knew nothing about . 
ah (.) who's this ? 
one of Thomas's coaches ? 
0 [=! gasps] Bertie_the_Bus . 
your favorite . 
oh what about the little man fishing ? 
are you ? 
right we've rescued the man fishing and (..) one of the lamp posts . 
there's still another lamp post lying on the line . 
the sheep seem alright „ don't they ? 
they don't seem to have [<] affected [>] . 
that [//] well the man with the boat . 
yes he needs rescuing I think . 
thank you . 
is it Isabelle's Daddy ? 
I thought it was (..) Keira's Mummy and Daddy . 
but it's Isabelle's Daddy „ is it ? 
what's Isabelle's Daddy called ? 
Daddy_Rod . 
did you see Daddy_Rod today ? 
did you talk to him ? 
oh [<] . 
they can't . 
they have just [<] rescued by Cranky . 
this is a favorite saying „ isn't it ? 
+" do you know what . 
no , Thomas . 
everything blew away . 
do you remember that story we useta read ? 
Henry in the forest ? 
that was one of my favorites . 
I can't really remember it but (..) it was something to do with all the engines . 
were all the engines asleep in the engine shed ? 
at the end of a busy day . 
and Henry particularly loved the forest „ didn't he ? 
because his journey home was through the forest looking at all the trees . 
and as the engines were in the engine shed listening to the wind whistling outside +//. [+ N] 
what sort of noise was it making ? 
0 [=! whistles] . 
he was saying I hope the trees haven't blown down in the forest . 
and sure enough the next morning the trains all got up (.) and Henry's driver said@q . 
there is [*] leafs and twigs and branches everywhere@q . 
0 [=! gasps] . 
Henry was so upset „ wasn't he „ when he saw the damage that the wind had done . 
but anyway the [//] they managed to clear the line and before long lots_of new young trees were planted . 
and Henry was ever so excited because as he drove along the country lanes +/. [+ N] 
he could see +/. [+ N] 
+, all the new trees growing up „ couldn't he ? 
he could watch them growing . 
do you remember that story ? 
no ? 
Buzz_Lightyear ?

Daddy's asleep at the moment . 
mind you saying that there are fireworks going off outside . 
it's a bit early for fireworks „ isn't it ? 
I don't know why the [*] let them off so soon . 
you can tell Purdie's going a little bit deaf , Thomas , because she's outside and she hasn't moved once . 
normally she's frightened by those big bangs . 
let's have a look at this smart watch .
