where's what gone , Thomas ?

it's a bright light . 
it's a bright light . 
is the apple good , Thomas ? 
po@c . 
it's po@c . 
<it's red> [>] . 
it's a stacking ring . 
Mummy's going to pour herself that cup of tea . 
pouring the tea from the pot into the cup . 
it's a mug „ isn't it ? 
not a cup . 
meow . 
it's a picture of a pussy+cat on it „ isn't it ? 
and [>] while you finish your apple I'm going to ping@f [?] some toast . 
baby nice . 
your nice . 
Daddy's nice . 
who else is nice ? 
new chair ? 
is the new chair nice ? 
it's not really too new now „ is it ? 
no . 
I think when you've finished your breakfast and we've washed your hands we'd better brush your hair as well . 
couldn't catch that , Thomas . 
you were eating an apple . 
what did you say ? 
all done ? 
oh I think you've put too much in . 
no . 
eat it properly . 
showing off now „ aren't you ? 
no [/] no . 
no kicking . 
big banging . 
no . 
Thomas . 
no . 
no kicking . 
Thomas ! 
what did Grandad say to you last night ? 
yes . 
because he didn't want you kicking „ did he ? 
we went to a wedding a few weeks ago . 
and somebody had a video there and a camera . 
and you were smiling at the camera „ weren't you ? 
smile . 
say cheese for the photograph . 
what were you doing ? 
you were smiling „ weren't you ? 
smile to the camera . 
that's it ? 
so they should be interesting photographs when they come out . 
in the bathroom he has a Teletubby set which includes a water+wheel and spurting flowers . 
so when you put water in the flowers spurt out water and the wheel moves round . 
and there's a slide that the Teletubbies can slide down „ isn't there ? 
and that's the handset . 
you know the big microphone from the Teletubby +/. [+ N] 
it often pops up out of the floor on Teletubbies . 
well it's a big microphone and they talk into it „ don't they ? 
but you like playing with that „ don't you ? 
so we bring it down from the bathroom . 
a big bear . 
oh yes there's a big bear on Teletubbies „ isn't there ? 
big bear . 
talk to Jo and Sue on the telephone . 
tell them what you're doing . 
so he often has conversations in the handset . 
and whoever he's talking to he always tells them that Daddy works in a chip shop . 
that's Daddy's [/] Daddy's coat . 
if you don't want it pop it back in the bowl please . 
oh you're giving it to Mummy to eat .

<a bang> [/] a bang . 
only naughty boys bang . 
is Thomas a good boy or a naughty boy ? 
no . 
Thomas . 
that's not banging . 
that's kicking . 
and that's dropping and throwing . 
I think you're showing off „ aren't you ?

that's naughty . 
oops oh dear .

there nearly wasn't anything on the table .

I thought we'd have a look at some faces <in a minute> [>] .

would you like to help Mummy do something now ? 
this is icing sugar .

let's pop a bit of icing sugar through the sieve . 
actually I think we could have put it straight in the bowl but +/. 
we're sieving icing sugar . 
actually this isn't even a sieve . 
it's a tea+strainer . 
silly Mummy . 
you've not seen sieving before though . 
so that's quite good . 
let's do some more . 
more . 
it's sugar . 
icing sugar . 
Grandad has sugar in his cups of coffee . 
but it's not this type of sugar „ is it ? 
this is more +/. [+ N] 
what does this remind you of , Thomas ? 
snow ? 
does it look like snow ? 
don't put your fingers in because you've got to eat this . 
I know you've just washed your fingers but it's still not nice „ is it ? 
not nice . 
and luckily the clothes you're wearing now are just clothes that you had on when you got up . 
because I would imagine by the time we've done this , before we go on our train ride , we'll hafta change „ won't we ? 
right . 
here you are . 
would you like to play with the sieve ? 
and we'll pop <a drop> [//] a tiny drop of +/. [+ N] 
now this is going to be very hot so +/. [+ N] 
drop of hot water in there . 
<that's right> [?] .

can you see it ? 
give it a mix .

the sieve is for sieving the lumps out of the sugar . 
no , poppet [?] . 
no . 
let [//] just let Mummy finish mixing it . 
you can help mix . 
that's right . 
let's stir it . 
that looks almost right . 
and then we're going to spread some of this icing on some biscuits . 
and we've got some Smarties . 
and some Chocolate_Buttons . 
thought we could do some faces . 
should have made some red icing then we could have piped some lips on . 
before we do that shall we just look at a few faces in a book ? 
I think that's fine , Thomas . 
there we are . 
more drop ? 
just wipe those little hands . 
where's Thomas's face ? 
I think I've got icing on my nose . 
it's a tin with some biscuits in it . 
one two three four biscuits . 
four biscuits .

you didn't &-uh (.) eat it „ did you ? 
this is very hot water in this bowl . 
ooh .

does this remind you of snow , Thomas ? 
no snow . 
right . 
icing's running down the side of that one . 
are you going to put some Smarties and Buttons on there ? 
Thomas . 
do you wanna decorate ? 
put some Smarties or Buttons on there . 
that's it . 
that's it .

with Chocolate_Buttons and orange Smarties . 
yes . 
there you are . 
are you going to do something with that one ? 
we've got some Buttons here . 
you've decorated the biscuits with two green Buttons . 
think there's enough icing to do another one „ isn't there ? 
when we do this again , Thomas . 
Mummy'll make some red icing and put it in a piping bag and you can pipe on some smily faces . 
because most things have faces „ don't they ? 
can you see that little girl's face on the packet of Buttons ? 
she's wearing a red dress „ isn't she ? 
it's a little girl . 
now don't eat all those Smarties . 
you didn't finish your breakfast . 
put some on here . 
that's right . 
now when Daddy comes home you can show him what you've made . 
can't you ? 
hm: ? 
there's some biscuit crumbs in this icing . 
&-uh (.) I can't see a lot going on the biscuits . 
but look at that . 
that's fantastic . 
isn't that good ? 
a good boy .

two eyes and a nose . 
what about a mouth ? 
they haven't got mouths „ have they ? 
you've got some silver buttons upstairs but I think +/. [+ IN] 
not upstairs , in the cupboard . 
but I think they're a little bit small for you . 
how about we do this ? 
it's not really going to show up „ is it ?

we could frown by doing it that way .

or a +/. [+ IN] 
Thomas Lastname . 
are you going to use some Buttons ? 
before they magic away . [+ PI]

and two eyes . 
and what about two ears sticking up .

some more Buttons . 
let's decorate those others . 
all done . 
it's empty .

I promise you . 
oh po@c baby .

a po@c bib . 
now put some of these Chocolate_Buttons on there .

don't take them off , Thomas , once we have done them because Daddy would like that . 
get a plate and when Daddy comes home he can have one with a cup of coffee „ can't he ?

well you can't have them all . 
there isn't room in that teeshirt for all those . 
now put them back on the plate now . 
and then we'll put them in the fridge . 
or the biscuit tin would be better „ wouldn't it ? 
because if we put them in the fridge the biscuits will go soft . 
hat@c . 
green one .

what are we going to do with these ? 
how about we give two to Dimitra if she doesn't mind them being handled ?

I think he's referring to the icecream van . 
comes round every night and we call it the icecream bus . 
and one Sunday Peter [//] Daddy went out to buy an icecream from him „ didn't he ? 
but when the icecream man rings his bell it's because there's no icecream . 
he (h)as sold up and he's going home .

poor Lala . 
oh .

is it bedtime ? 
what do you do when you're asleep , Thomas ? 
you snore ?
