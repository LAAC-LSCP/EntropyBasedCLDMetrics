Lofty and Wendy join the crew . 
right . 
could I have the other piece that looks like this , Thomas , please . 
thank you very much . 
I think we're about done +/. [+ IN] 
it is like a table „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
oh I'm glad you recognize it as something . 
we'll do this and if haven't got it right we can just alter it later „ can't we ? 
right , Thomas , we need two more black screws . 
on this side please .

but we need two more . 
would you like to fetch them for me ? 
oh not those .

I'm quite impressed with this .

and your contribution is to hammer everything „ is it ? 
you must be gentle with it though , Thomas . 
don't hammer too hard . 
you'll snap it . 
and then Mummy won't be pleased „ will she ?

I would imagine that's +/. [+ IN] 
+, foam rubber . 
oops [<] . 
when the shelf is standing upright it won't topple over „ will it ? 
it won't slip about . 
right . 
now I think we're going to need some more screws then that . 
but it's a screwdriver you need for screws , Thomas . 
you don't hammer in everything . 
Bob_the_Builder doesn't hammer everything „ does he ? 
he bangs the walls . 
but he uses screwdrivers and other things . 
now would you like to +//. [+ IN] 
look . 
would you like to screw that on ? 
with your finger .

we move it like this so the pipes go straight there . 
and then we get +/. [+ IN] 
well we've got some pipes underneath the kitchen sink „ haven't we ? 
don't you think we built that very quickly and easily , Thomas ? 
I think that's brilliant . 
and what's more it (h)as not dropped to bits „ has it ? 
no . 
right . 
now it (h)as come with some little hooks . 
I'm not quite sure what they're for . 
it says hanging hooks .

that's lovely . 
that's great .

that was a mistake . 
that's it . 
you're going to build it there ? 
there (.) that is good of you . 
oh the same (h)as happened to you . 
are you proud of that ? 
I think really what we could have done (.) because we know the pipe is at the side +/. [+ IN] 
I think perhaps we should have turned +/. [+ IN] 
has his hat fallen off ? 
I think what we might do +/. [+ IN] 
is just turn this round because we know +/. [+ IN] 
+, that the pipes in the kitchen cupboard +//. [+ IN] 
would you like to hold these for me please ? 
we know the pipes in the kitchen cupboard are at this side „ don't we ? 
now be careful with that . 
we're going to needta keep that . 
would you like to put that somewhere safe . 
<put it> [>] . 
put it on the table please . 
somewhere safe like that . 
now we're going to turn this round now . 
let's move it right the way round „ <shall we> [>] ? 
like that . 
that's [/] that's it . 
like a ladder . 
do you know it does look like a ladder „ doesn't it ? 
hm: . 
climb up to see what's on the table ? 
look what you've done . 
oh aren't you clever ? 
that's right . 
you make a good builder , Thomas . 
right . 
would you like to fit the screw again ? 
oh clever boy . 
would you like to tighten the screw there ? 
like that . 
no . 
the other way . 
tighten it up . 
that's loosening it . 
tighten it up like that . 
spin it round . 
and we've one more to do . 
this one . 
that way round . 
that's right . 
that's tightening it . 
oh that's wonderful . 
and then we've got to fit these two back on „ haven't we ? 
that we took off before . 
<no no> [/] no . 
we don't unscrew it . 
no . 
<no no> [/] no . 
right . 
you pop those two shelves back there . 
the other one up here next to it . 
that's it . 
now it goes into the cupboard under the sink . 
look . 
we pull it that way a bit . 
however wide the sink is the u-bend and the pipes go under there . 
and then we've got one two three shelves for stacking things . 
by [>] gum . 
what about organization ? 
come here and give me a cuddle for being <a proper> [?] [>] Bob_the_Builder . 
what about sweeties ? 
for doing that ? 
come here . 
typical workman . 
always wanting a cup of tea or a sweetie . 
oh ! 
look . 
aren't we clever building that together ? 
it's a good job Isabelle bought you that Bob_the_Builder's hat „ isn't it ? 
well your hat and your hammer you're using now . 
some of these hooks have fallen off . 
that to me suggests , Thomas , that they clip on somewhere . 
but I can't see +//. [+ IN] 
where do you think they clip on ? 
are you enjoying that ? 
ah now you're using the hammer to brush Mummy's hair ? 
ah . 
ah . 
you don't need any more cuddles ? 
<shh shh> [/] shh . 
shall we have a look through this catalogue ?

Bob_the_Builder Mummy ? 
you've put +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
you're putting your yellow hat on my head . 
and what are those , darling ? 
they're not sausages . 
they're weighing scales „ aren't they ? 
that's right . 
yes . 
the slippers are on the weighing scales . 
I think they're showing you how very light they are . 
that's a small bag „ isn't it ? 
who bought you the bag ? 
silly woman ? 
that's not nice „ is it ? 
just be gentle with it , Thomas . 
it isn't a +//. [+ IN] 
xxx [<] bang too hard „ is it ? [+ PI] 
look . 
you've got a wrench over there . 
and I'm sure you've got a screwdriver . 
well over in your toy box there's a plastic container . 
it (h)as got a blue lid . 
oh it's alright . 
that needs to go in the bin actually . 
would you like to put all these things in the bag ? 
that's it . 
that can go in the bin . 
there's a plastic container in your toy box with all your tools in it . 
it should have a blue lid but I think I'm washing the lid . 
so it won't be on the box at the moment . 
that's right . 
look . 
you can keep all your bits and pieces in there . 
I think you've got more tools upstairs because before your party +/. [+ IN] 
I moved a lot of things because we had all sorts of people coming to the party „ hadn't we ? 
all different ages . 
we had Abigail and Becky +/. [+ IN] 
and Georgia who are really quite young . 
and Mummy was frightened that if we had lots_of little things lying around that the babies might put them in their mouths . 
so I think your tool set was one of the things I took upstairs . 
better get it down <again „ hadn't I> [>] ? 
yes . 
are there yellow traffic signs ? 
I think they're nuts and bolts actually but +... [+ IN] 
oh you do sound snuffily , Thomas . 
oh I see . 
you're using the slats in the shelves as a little post box <so that> [>] +... [+ IN] 
hello , puss . 
it's a helicopter ? 
it sounds very low . 
I think it's just an ordinary aeroplane . 
but it did sound quite low „ didn't it ? 
that's another thing that we took upstairs as well . 
all your letters . 
your post box thing . 
well again because I [/] I thought there were a lot of people here . 
and if [/] if all your letters were spread out on the floor it would be quite dangerous „ wouldn't it ? 
don't put that in your mouth , darling . 
because once you get all those envelopes on the floor they can be a bit slippy „ can't they ? 
so I was a little bit worried that if the floor was covered in letters people walking on it might slip and fall . 
and we wouldn't want that „ would we ? 
hello , puss . 
look what Thomas and I made . 
look at this . 
oh she must be impressed with this .

and this is your toolbox . 
and I'm impressed with that because that'll keep all your tools tidy . 
shall I go and find the lid ? 
look <your Bob_the_Builder belt> [>] . 
Thomas . 
you could have put your Bob_the_Builder belt on „ couldn't you ? 
to have done those jobs . 
do you think your belt will fit in this toolbox ? 
yes it will . 
look at that . 
that's smart . 
are you ? 
does that mean you're feeling tired ? 
yes . 
I can see . 
you usually put hair in your ear when you're feeling tired . 
Mummy's hair . 
so if you're putting Purdie's fur in (.) that must mean you're feeling a little bit tired again . 
there (.) there's an empty box now . 
would you like to play with that ? 
Thomas ! 
<no no> [/] no . 
you don't throw it at Purdie ! 
I'm just going to get the lid for your toolbox . 
and I think Purdie wants feeding „ doesn't she ? 
here you are , puss . 
what have you done ? 
what , love ? 
oh ! 
pop it back on there please .

it's more like a trolley ? 
you need some wheels ? 
yes . 
well the thing is when it's in the kitchen cupboard , darling , it's not going to needta be wheeled anywhere „ does it ? 
it needs to stay as still as it possibly can .

when the back's of lorrys come down <often they> [>] +... [+ IN]

that's right . 
press the button and the back of the lorry comes down .

and what happens then ? 
they can wheel trollies up and down „ can't they ? 
do you remember we saw that Schweppes lorry ? 
is it ? 
no . 
don't move it , darling . 
it (h)as got things standing on it now . 
we can't move it round like we did when it was empty . 
yes . 
though it's a shelf not a trolley . 
you're off your trolley .
