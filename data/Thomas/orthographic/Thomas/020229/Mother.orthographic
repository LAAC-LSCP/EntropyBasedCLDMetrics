Mummy planted some windmills in some pots outside so that you could watch them .

you tell her . 
she better not do that while she's out „ had she ?

somebody (h)as put their rubbish out and one of the bags has torn open and some newspaper's lying on the floor . 
when the bin men come later on . 
when that big truck comes to take away all the bin bags they'll probably pick that up and take it as well . 
do you think they'll take it in <the big lorry> [//] the big truck ? 
watch . 
I'm getting confused . 
the bin men aren't coming today „ are they ? 
it must be somebody going away for the weekend so they put the rubbish out early . 
I bet it's not Mister_Fox that (h)as ripped open the bin bag . 
Mister_Fox comes at night „ doesn't he ? 
well if it's still there when we go out and nobody else has picked it up we'll pick it up „ won't we ?
