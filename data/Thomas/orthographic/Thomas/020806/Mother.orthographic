shall we turn the Christmas tree on ? 
where did we get this yesterday ? 
we got it from B_and_Q ?

Thomas . 
what did Grandad say about the tree ? 
you mustn't touch it „ must you ?

Grandma and Grandad bought you the blue wellies and they bought you some thick socks to go +/. [+ IN] 
oh thank you .

because they were a little bit too big . 
going to show Dimitra the Wellingtons ? 
you've thrown them down ? 
well that's not nice . 
are you going to pick them up and come and bring them to me .

they're not quite too small . 
you can still wear them but we have a bit of a job getting them on . 
Teletubbies . 
look . 
look at the difference in size . 
wow ! 
these are really too big at the moment though „ aren't they ? 
because you wore them yesterday and your foot kept slipping out „ didn't it ? 
wellies . 
let's see . 
look . 
shall we put them like that ? 
well actually they don't look +//. [+ IN] 
oh I've got the wrong foot . 
silly Mummy . 
they're not too different „ are they ? 
fire engine mixed it ? 
oh fire engine [/] fire engine fix it . 
they're mended now . 
look these have Tweenys on them . 
the new ones don't have anything „ do they ? 
would you like some stickers on the new ones ? 
would you ? 
some Teletubby ones ? 
shall we go and get some stickers and put them on ?

I'm not sure whether they're waterproof , Thomas . 
we might hafta (.) put them on again . 
look . 
what have we got here ? 
Tweenys . 
well shall we put Tinky_Winky and Po on one and Dipsy and Lala on the other one ? 
xxx . 
we'll put the light on because it's a little bit dark this morning . 
there's a chair for you Dimitra if you would like to come and join us . 
now if we put it on the outside . 
oh . 
we've ripped it . 
that's not a good start „ is it ? 
how about there ? 
are you happy with that ? 
do you wanna stick that one down ? 
that's it . 
<and Po> [<] as well ? 
very very gently pull it off . 
that's it . 
xxx . 
shall we put it on this one because those have got Teletubbies on already . 
put it on quite near the top . 
because I don't think they're very +//. [+ IN] 
shall we just move it down a little bit ? 
I don't think they're very waterproof , Thomas . 
so +/. [+ IN] 
you want Tinky_Winky's bag on the Wellington with Tinky_Winky ? 
right . 
do you wanna stick it down there ? 
I shouldn't say it [?] . 
I should say Po „ shouldn't I ? 
Tinky_Winky's bag . 
where you going to put Tinky's bag ?

Lala's ball . 
well shall we put Lala on first before we put the ball ? 
you don't wanna put Lala on ? 
oh . 
do you wanna put the ball on ? 
okay . 
it will roll away though if there's nobody there to hold it . 
right . 
there we are . 
Lala . 
now shall we put the other one quite near the top ? 
up the top ? 
up here ? 
oh . 
and Dipsy . 
the thing is when we go out in the rain , Thomas , I don't think these stickers are waterproof . 
I think if you put them nearer the top we've more chance of the lasting „ haven't we ? 
oh . 
at the bottom ? 
is that where they're going ? 
oops a daisy . 
Dipsy's hat . 
now how about putting Dipsy's hat just above Dipsy's head ? 
<pop it> [/] pop it up there above his hat . 
aah . 
that's lovely „ isn't it ? 
it's a nice hat . 
so what have they got ? 
all there favorite things ? 
all done . 
right . 
are we going to put them on ? 
no ? 
we'll stay here . 
yes . 
what are you going to get ?

are you going to come and see us ? 
xxx . 
you're tidying the boxes up ? 
no . 
we'll do that later , Thomas . 
let's come and talk here and do something here . 
it's a funny thing but when Mummy wants you to tidy boxes you don't wanna tidy them „ do you ? 
no . 
I'm going to see if I can put these Wellingtons on . 
do you think I can ? 
another shoe [>] +/? [+ IN] 
oh . 
oh . 
it won't fit . 
can I walk in the mud ? 
I don't think I can , Thomas [?] , because they're too small for me . 
I'll try . 
yes . 
I'll try . 
mind the dustbin . 
I'll mind the post box too . 
yes . 
yes . 
and mind Dimitra . 
I can't walk very far , Thomas . 
they're too small . 
I think I'll put my shoes back on . 
do you think Po would look nice wearing your Wellingtons ? 
oh you're a dustbin man now . 
collecting all the rubbish for me . 
pardon ? 
a wagon ? 
the dustbin wagon ? 
now <be careful> [>] . 
<be careful> [/] be careful . 
see a flash ? 
you mean the flashing lights on top ? 
is that what you're meaning ? 
and what color are the flashing lights on top of the dustbin lorry ? 
there's one over there . 
oops . 
oh darling . 
be careful . 
are you alright ? 
you've tidied up the rubbish „ have you ? 
well done . 
got one left ? 
it's a very big bag of rubbish „ <isn't it> [>] ? 
the dustbin bags have gone ? 
<that's a big>[//] oh_gosh that's a big bag of rubbish . 
what do you think (i)s in that sack ? 
what do you think somebody has thrown away ? 
poos ? 
we don't throw that away in the dustbin bag . 
what do you think (i)s inside ? 
blackcurrant juice empty ? 
you mean an empty bottle of blackcurrant juice ? 
well if it's a glass bottle we take it to the recycle bin „ don't we ? 
might have been a plastic bottle I suppose . 
where're you going now [?] , Thomas ? 
oh no . 
don't hide in the cupboard , darling . 
shall we show Dimitra your photographs ? 
<oh no> [/] oh no ? 
I think she'd like to see them . 
look . 
who's this ? 
oh no . 
be gentle . 
be careful [/] be careful . 
ooh . 
take it back ? 
you don't wanna look at it ? 
you want me to put it back up there ? 
do you not think that's a nice photograph of you ? 
no ? 
oh I'm not putting it in the dustbin bag . 
I'm not putting your photograph in the dustbin bag . 
what have you put in the dustbin bag ? 
letters . 
that looks like a piece of rubbish . 
think that can go in the dustbin bag „ don't you ? 
and there's an apple on the floor there ? 
over [?] there . 
that could perhaps do with going in the bin . 
actually . 
what about your Wellingtons ? 
they're too small now . 
shall we throw those away ? 
they're too big ? 
the new ones are too big „ aren't they ? 
I don't think we should really put those in the bin anyway because they're nice Wellingtons . 
somebody else might like to wear those . 
Thomas . 
come here . 
it's alright . 
oh look at the rain now . 
dear . 
did you hear a funny noise ? 
do you think it's coming from the Christmas tree ? 
bee^baas@c ? 
where did you get the tree ? 
B_and_Q ? 
you got it from B_and_Q .

who bought the tree ? 
Grandad and Nana .

and if you put it on this table Dimitra and I can watch you . 
if you go through there we can't see what you're doing .

you don't wanna play with that ? 
what's Postman_Pat doing now ? 
I dread to think . 
are you posting letters ? 
are you ? 
at the post office ? 
because Postman_Pat doesn't usually post letters „ does he ? 
not at the post office . 
he empties the box at the post office and he posts letters through other peoples letterboxes . 
but he doesn't tend to post a lot of things at the post office himself . 
does he ? 
oh well . 
I'm sorry . 
is there another letter for me ? 
thank you . 
oh this is nice . 
isn't it ?

Jess is in hospital . 
oh . 
oh no . 
Jess is in hospital . 
she's very poorly . 
what's the matter with her ? 
oh [/] oh thank you . 
what's the matter with Jess ? 
she (h)as got a sore knee ? 
are you thinking of Humpty_Dumpty on the wall ? 
Humpty_Dumpty's in hospital „ isn't he ? 
well it looks to me like Postman_Pat might be licking some stamps . 
are you going to stick some stamps on this envelope ? 
you don't wanna do that with the stamps ? 
Christmas stamps ? 
and who are they for ? 
Mummy ?
