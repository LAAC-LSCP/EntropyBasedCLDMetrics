she's here „ isn't she ?

well if she goes outside she's not going to get food „ is she ? 
she needs to stay in . 
no . 
she's not crying . 
oh yes she is .

I don't think Purdie eats oranges „ does she ? 
yes . 
she does . 
well you've just stepped out of the bath „ haven't you ?

no . 
Purdie doesn't like baths , Thomas . 
yes . 
I do . 
let's put your nice <clean vest on> [>] . 
and you like them as well ? 
no . 
pussy cats don't like water , Thomas . 
no . 
I think you'll find she doesn't like water . 
oh she likes milk . 
yes . 
she likes water to drink . 
but she doesn't like water on her fur . 
or her paws . 
that's why she doesn't like going out when it's wet . 
it is nice to see her „ isn't it ? 
oh you giving me a big hug ? 
giving the ginger cat a big hug ? 
oh you're giving Mummy a big hug . 
do I look like the ginger cat ? 
oh thank you , Thomas . 
have you missed Mummy while you've been at Nana's ? 
have you ? 
would you like a cushion behind your head ? 
lie down . 
Purdie doesn't like fireworks .

Purdie doesn't like the noise of them „ does she ? 
all the banging . 
yes . 
you like them . 
have you had a wee on that towel ? 
no [<] . 
okay . 
well I think she might like to do that if we let her out ? 
we'll just get you dressed first . 
and then we'll see to Purdie . 
so what did you do at Nana's and Granddad's ? 
you don't know ? 
you were eating sandwiches ? 
Auntie_Patty came too and ate two crispies ?

xxx [>] . 
and Auntie_Patty came „ did she ? 
oh very nice . 
in a big blue car ? 
a little car ? 
was it a big car or a little car ? 
a little car . 
I thought it was . 
and what sort of sandwiches did you eat ? 
white ones ? 
on white bread ? 
and did Grandma make them ? 
what did they have inside . 
not got any food in it ? 
well a sandwich usually has something in between the bread . 
did she just give you bread ? 
I don't think she did . 
I think it had a filling inside of some sort „ don't you ? 
did it have cheese ? 
I thought it might . 
or chicken ? 
and ham ? 
cheese and ham ? 
it sounds very nice . 
that's Purdie crying because she wants letting out . 
let's get you xxx on quickly . [+ PI] 
that's right . 
not yet , Purdie . 
just a minute or two . 
lie back please . 
are you asking Purdie if she wants to play with your boxes while she's waiting to be let out ? 
oh well she likes sitting in boxes . 
big boxes „ doesn't she ? 
I don't think she could really play with your little boxes . 
right . 
could you keep your legs down ? 
straight [>] please . 
right . 
lie still . 
you like Purdie's fur ? 
were you saying it's nice to see her tail ? 
can you pop your legs straight please ? 
and did you miss Purdie ? 
ah . 
you missed Sharon and Purdie ? 
well you were seeing Sharon while you were staying there . 
Auntie_Sharon . 
Auntie_David ? 
it's Uncle_David . 
no . 
Uncle_David is Daddy's brother . 
and he's married to Auntie_Sharon . 
it's Uncle_David and Auntie_Sharon . 
Auntie_Michael ? 
<no no> [/] no . 
Uncle_Michael . 
men are always called Uncle . 
and ladys are always called Auntie or Aunt . 
aren't they ? 
can you see pigeons ? 
they're not hurting Purdie . 
but I think they've flown off because they've seen her . 
they're going up in the sky ? 
flying towards the moon „ aren't they ? 
or the sun we should say . 
it's daytime „ isn't it ? 
fly towards the sun in daytime . 
is it not sunny ? 
it was earlier on „ wasn't it ? 
right . 
you just sit there , Thomas . 
and I'll let Purdie out . 
just sit still please . 
Thomas , where have you put the keys ? 
what have you done with the keys ? 
where are they keys , darling ? 
for the door ?

you don't know what you've done with them ? 
well we can't let Purdie out „ can we ? 
oh they're here . 
you posted them through the slot of the fire guard ? 
yes . 
I've just found them on the hearth . 
Purdie's a clever girl „ is she ? 
there we are , Purdie . 
there's a big pigeon sitting up +//. [+ IN] 
oh two big pigeons sitting on the conservatory roof . 
can you see them ? 
Auntie_Linda's house ? 
in somebody's door ? 
it's the top of the conservatory roof „ isn't it ? 
no . 
no it's not flying . 
there's some more on the Battersby's house roof . 
can you see them ? 
four pigeons . 
it's a lampshade . 
what about the lampshade ? 
it hurt Daddy ? 
what did Daddy do ? 
stand up and bump his head ? 
did he ? 
when was that ? 
earlier on ? 
oh right . 
oh no . 
I don't think it would hurt Purdie . 
because Purdie doesn't go on the table „ does she ? 
and even if she did she wouldn't be tall enough to bump her head on it . 
right . 
would you like to put your feet in these trousers please [>] . 
what's happening here ? 
well the lampshade's twiddling round because you've just been spinning it . 
there you are . 
pop your other foot in please [>] . 
oh you giving me a &ca +//. [+ IN] 
do you think my hair looks like a ginger cat ? 
you've just said “big hug ginger cat” .

oh . 
have you missed your Mummy ? 
you've missed the ginger cat ? 
have you missed Mummy ? 
yes . 
is it nice to be home ? 
is it nice to be at home ? 
the lampshade's spinning . 
you shouldn't do that really , Thomas . 
you shouldn't play with it . 
that's Daddy's fault . 
because when you were a baby he useta spin it so you could watch it . 
and now that you're a big boy you think you can do it yourself „ don't you ? 
mhm . 
there we are . 
right . 
don't put it on the floor . 
it isn't , Thomas . 
it isn't . 
it's the pillow . 
it isn't a dustbin wagon . 
it's a cushion . 
a pillow . 
it's not a dustbin bag . 
you missed the dustbin men here . 
because they came early today . 
did you see them at Nana and Granddad's house ? 
a green one ? 
two trolleys ? 
yellow coats ? 
who was wearing yellow coats ? 
the men ? 
and what did they do with the bin bags ? 
you don't know ? 
I thought you said you (h)ad watched them . 
no . 
not wash them . 
watch them . 
have you seen them ? 
did you not watch them putting the rubbish into the bin ? 
you told me you had . 
it's not a dustbin bag . 
it's a cushion . 
it is . 
it is not a dustbin wagon . 
you're a dustbin man „ are you ? 
you throw the rubbish on the floor ? 
you're a messpot . 
right . 
go on . 
off you go . 
oh . 
right . 
not on the floor , Thomas . 
no . 
not on the floor . 
yes . 
that's right . 
you going to come and sit in your chair ? 
yes . 
what have we got in there ? 
well while you were at Grandma's +/. [+ IN] 
I was looking through the cupboards . 
and I came across some jigsaws . 
do you remember Auntie_Monica and Uncle_Paul at Christmas in York ? 
well when you were a baby they gave me +/. [+ IN] 
gave me these . 
they belonged to their children . 
and at the time you were too young for them . 
so Mummy put them away in the cupboard and I've just found them now . 
lots_of wooden jigsaws . 
lots and lots . 
oh look . 
there's one that says Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
there are three [//] four . 
and that one's Postman_Pat . 
right . 
can I tip all this out ? 
it's going to make a noise . 
just a minute . 
you don't like the noise ? 
that wasn't too bad „ was it ? 
no . 
well this one . 
look . 
it looks like it (h)as got things like teddy bears (.) cars and trees . 
this one looks like it might be an animal one . 
because that looks like the outline of a [/] a pig . 
and that looks like a horse . 
and this +/. [+ IN] 
you wanna hold those ? 
and that's the jigsaws . 
and this one says Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
and this one's Postman_Pat . 
so +... [+ IN] 
right . 
what do you think that is ? 
well shall we put that in the Thomas_The_Tank_Engine one ? 
will it ? 
I don't know . 
that looks like it might be part of an engine as well . 
oh that fits there . 
look . 
it looks like the big pieces belong to the Thomas_The_Tank_Engine jigsaw „ doesn't it ? 
and that bit goes there . 
do you think that bit goes there ? 
that's right . 
oh [<] ! 
well done ! 
right . 
how many pieces do you think we needta make that jigsaw ? 
there we are . 
does that look like it belongs to the Thomas one ? 
and so does that one . 
so two pieces left . 
do you think that piece belongs here ? 
it's a bit of the fat controller „ isn't it ? 
that's right . 
do you wanna turn it round ? 
round again . 
keep trying it different [/] different ways until it fits . 
that looks like it's right . 
well do you wanna finish the Thomas one ? 
there's only one piece to put in . 
right . 
that's the Thomas_The_Tank_Engine one . 
that's lovely „ isn't it ? 
Postman_Pat . 
oh now this one's a little bit easier . 
because it (h)as actually got the pattern printed on it . 
so all you hafta do is match +//. [+ IN] 
find the matching one . 
well done . 
well done . 
that's [>] . 
ah who's that ? 
Postman_Pat . 
Missus_Hubbard ? 
let's see if we can find something else . 
mhm . 
I'm just trying to find some pieces that look +//. [+ IN] 
ah . 
looks to me like that one might belong to Postman_Pat . 
and that one . 
Missus_Hubbard ? 
or Miss_Hubbard . 
exciting ? 
there we are now . 
look . 
this jigsaw's lovely . 
because (.) this is Missus_Pottidge (.) arriving at the post office . 
and the post office door's shut „ isn't it ? 
she looks like she might've just posted the letter through the letter box „ doesn't she ? 
now if you lift this one out (.) what happens inside the post office ? 
oh ! 
she goes in and she's talking too +... [+ IN] 
Missus_Goggins . 
that's good „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
put it back in . 
now (.) there's Postman_Pat's van parked . 
do you wanna lift that piece out and see what happens inside ? 
oh ! 
it's inside his van ! 
what's inside his van ? 
it looks like his postbag . 
is it a postbag ? 
and what else is in the post van ? 
teddy bear ? 
it looks like a lot of parcels . 
now (.) Miss_Hubbard is cycling „ isn't she ? 
she's riding her bicycle . 
lift it up . 
she's still cycling . 
but this time she's waving . 
she must have been shopping because look . 
her shopping basket's empty . 
and when you lift it up it's full . 
it's got dog food and rice in it . 
right now . 
this is Granny_Dryden's house . 
looks like Jess is delivering a letter to Granny_Dryden . 
and Granny_Dryden's standing (.) outside her house with the ginger pussy cat . 
now shall we lift that one up and see what happens ? 
oh Granny_Dryden's inside with a cup of tea . 
and look she (h)as got +... [+ IN] 
ginger cat sitting on the top of her armchair . 
and who's <sitting at the> [//] sitting at her feet drinking from a bowl ? 
who's that ? 
Jess . 
she (h)as let Jess in . 
and [<] finally we've got Postman_Pat opening the letter box . 
oh ! 
that's right . 
we can see inside the postbox „ can't we ? 
it's full of letters . 
and what's he doing ? 
emptying them into his +... [+ IN] 
his sack in his van . 
would you like to do that one again ? 
no ? 
not yet . 
well we've done the Thomas one . 
we've done the Postman_Pat . 
shall we have a look at some others ? 
there are three others to do . 
we haven't written yet to thank people for the Christmas presents . 
but I think when we write to Monica and Paul we should tell them we're finally using the jigsaws . 
it's a dog in his special house . 
I think it goes there . 
tractor and trailer . 
I think that goes in this one . 
it looks to me as if this might be a farmyard jigsaw . 
it's a house . 
do you think it might work there ? 
oh [<] right . 
yes . 
it's a house „ isn't it ? 
and this is another house . 
that's lovely . 
that's it . 
so that must be the farmer's house . 
no . 
that's right . 
and like the Postman_Pat jigsaw . 
when we lift it up there's nobody in it . 
what's that ? 
you don't know ? 
it's a horse . 
oh I think it will , Thomas . 
just keep trying . 
if at first you don't succeed you hafta keep trying . 
until something works . 
that's right . 
where do you think those go ? 
here . 
and what are they ? 
pigs . 
right . 
now what's this ? 
oh_gosh . 
you did that quickly , Thomas . 
now (.) what else are we looking for ? 
that's a [/] a sheep . 
I think that fits in that jigsaw . 
there's a big horse . 
that's a funny horse . 
it looks like a blue and yellow horse „ doesn't it ? 
that's it . 
and there's a +/. [+ IN] 
more pigs . 
that's right . 
a different jigsaw . 
a pig . 
a bunny rabbit . 
what color's the bunny rabbit ? 
it's eating a carrot . 
what color's the rabbit ? 
that's right . 
right . 
we've got another cow . 
I think that belongs to this jigsaw . 
have a look there . 
this one . 
oh that's lovely . 
that looks like it might be some trees . 
you telling the trees to lie down in the slot ? 
now there are two trees there „ aren't there ? 
so it might be called the wood . 
or a forest . 
<when there are more than one> [//] when there's more than one tree it could be a forest or a wood . 
or a park or garden . 
I think it will . 
just keep trying , darling . 
oh lovely . 
there are two trees together . 
that's a big tall fir tree . 
what does that look like ? 
a Christmas tree . 
and this one looks like it might have Christmas decorations on it . 
because there are red baubles . 
but I think it's actually an apple tree . 
because apples grow on trees . 
that looks like it's a shape of a duck . 
here we are . 
there's the duck . 
oh a duck doesn't say <moo@o> [/] moo@o . 
what does a duck say ? 
now do you know what that is ? 
it fits in that slot . 
do you know what it is ? 
what does it look like ? 
it looks like a baa@o lamb . 
but it's actually a goat . 
right . 
Postman_Pat's ? 
you can see Postman_Pat ? 
well that's behind us . 
we've done that one . 
let's just finish these first „ shall we ? 
something big goes there . 
ah . 
I think it's this . 
look at that . 
it looks like a lion . 
I think it's sposta be a big wooly sheep . 
well there's nothing . 
when we lift the tractor up you can't see anything inside „ can you ? 
there's just one piece missing now of that jigsaw . 
&-uh I think it might be this . 
what's that ? 
another duck . 
it belongs in this jigsaw . 
so this is obviously a farmyard jigsaw . 
because you've got the farmer's house . 
the farmhouse . 
the tractor and trailer . 
a sheep . 
a cow . 
a horse . 
a cockerel . 
rabbit . 
duck . 
cow and pigs . 
and the one you're busy with now that's obviously another farmyard one . 
or at least animal one „ isn't it ? 
an apple tree . 
that's right . 
that's new „ <isn't it> [>] ? 
nobody eating it . 
ah look . 
that's a mother hen with her chick . 
ah it does work . 
there you are you see . 
no . 
this is <a little> [//] another +//. [+ IN] 
that might be the garage part of the farmhouse in this picture . 
or perhaps it's a barn . 
and , Thomas , I haven't a clue what that is . 
I think that must be a barn as well . 
where the farmer stores his hay and his straw . 
we've finished that one „ haven't we ? 
<what a funny> [<] thing . 
I wonder what on earth that's sposta be . 
don't you ? 
why not ? 
do you ? 
well let's just have a look at what we've got on this one . 
this looks a nice bright one to me . 
this says Early_Learning_Centre on it . 
an elephant . 
yes . 
where do you think the elephant goes ? 
yes . 
he does . 
it's just you've got him upside down . 
you've got the right slot . 
you're doing very well with these jigsaws „ aren't you ? 
it's the first time you've seen them . 
no [/] no . 
keep trying . 
if it doesn't try one way (.) turn it round . 
keep turning it round until it fits . 
yes . 
well have a think about . 
that's right . 
the elephant's head . 
it goes in this one . 
the elephant's head is always in the air . 
it's feet are always on the ground . 
so that gives you a clue as to which way up it should be . 
that's it . 
now what's this ? 
it's another tree . 
hm: . 
I think you're better putting it where it belongs . 
here . 
that's the shape of a tree „ isn't it ? 
this bottom xxx . [+ PI] 
it's another tree . 
now what (h)as that got on it ? 
apples again ? 
yellow apples . 
or it could be pears „ couldn't it ? 
it goes there . 
yellow pears . 
it could be a pear tree . 
or it could be an apple tree . 
oh that's a snail . 
have you not seen a snail like that before ? 
you know what that is „ don't you ? 
a teddy bear . 
the snail goes up there . 
that's the shape of a pussy cat „ isn't it ? 
so if you find the piece with the pussy cat on . 
that's right . 
it fits perfectly there . 
look . 
do you not ? 
oh there's the telephone . 
I'll just go and answer that . 
probably Daddy . 
have you made that Postman_Pat one up again ? 
that's clever „ isn't it ? 
I think you're very clever . 
don't put them on the floor . 
are you looking inside to see what's happening ? 
Missus_Goggins ? 
what's she doing ? 
she's sitting down . 
I think it's just a pattern on the wallpaper behind her . 
Pat glass ? 
like Postman_Pat's ? 
that's right . 
yes . 
he (h)as got glass and so has Missus +//. [+ IN] 
what's her name ? 
Missus_Goggins . 
that's the door of Postman_Pat's van „ isn't it ? 
there's an aeroplane there . 
and what's that ? 
you don't know ? 
it's a little house . 
it (h)as got another tree with it . 
and what are these ? 
you don't know ? 
they're flowers . 
flowers growing in a pot . 
perhaps it's a plant . 
a telephone . 
do you know what that is , Thomas ? 
no . 
it does . 
it works in that one . 
it goes in that one . 
fits there . 
keep turning it round till it fits . 
that's it . 
that's it . [+ SR] 
other way round . 
turn it round . 
it's a cup and saucer . 
and finally (.) a sailing ship . 
or a boat . 
that's very [/] very clever , Thomas . 
you'd like some pens ? 
well what I thought we might do (.) is get a piece of paper (.) and a pencil and shall we draw round these shapes ? 
xxx pieces of wooden jigsaw ? [+ PI] 
that's another thing Mummy found when she was sorting out some things . 
lots_of blank pieces of paper . 
oops a daisy . 
hm: . 
well it wasn't my head . 
but I just caught it when I was taking the file and paper down . 
just caught the lampshade again „ didn't it ? 
not sure where all the pencils have gone too . 
look . 
don't know . 
but look . 
with the green (.) crayon (.) I'm drawing around the shape of this apple tree . 
what would you like to draw ? 
you'd like to draw there ? 
shall I do the pussy cat ? 
where are the pencils , Thomas ? 
oh shall we use the orange one ? 
then we can draw a ginger cat . 
draw round the shape of pussy cat . 
there . 
how's that ? 
does it need some eyes ? 
and a nose ? 
and what else ? 
what else does a pussy cat need ? 
whiskers ? 
no . 
but if you're drawing a pussy cat we do . 
shall we put a big fluffy tail on it ? 
like Purdie . 
and it's paws . 
there we are . 
I think I might draw round Postman_Pat and the post office and the post box . 
yeah . 
shall we use the red one for that ? 
that's right . 
<if you keep it> [//] if you hold onto it with that . 
and draw round with that hand . 
draw round the shape . 
that's clever . 
there ! 
do you wanna put his glass on the picture ? 
those his glass ? 
very nice . 
what else you going to draw ? 
Postman_Pat's van . 
there you are . 
you could use the red one for that as well „ couldn't we ? 
oh you're using your right hand . 
sometimes you use your left hand . 
which is your right ? 
right . 
don't crayon on the cloth . 
<just on the> [/] just on the paper . 
which is Thomas's right hand ? 
yes . 
and which is your left hand ? 
good boy . 
your throat sounds croaky . 
is your voice alright ? 
I mean your voice <sounds> [>] croaky is your throat alright ? 
yes . 
shall we do Missus_Goggins on her bicycle ? 
&-uh no it's not Missus_Goggins . 
who's this ? 
Miss +... [+ IN] 
Miss_Hubbard . 
shall I draw Missus_Hubbard up here ? 
she (h)as got an empty shopping basket on the back . 
and an empty basket on the front of her bicycle . 
and when we look at the jigsaw inside she (h)as got some shopping in the back basket and she (h)as got her knitting . 
look . 
knitting wool and knitting needles (.) in the front basket . 
no . 
that's Missus_Goggins . 
she wears a hat „ doesn't she ? 
what color is her hat ? 
blue +... [+ IN] 
with a black band „ isn't it ? 
where (h)as what gone to , darling ? 
<she (h)as got> [/] she (h)as got quite a big nose „ as well „ hasn't she ? 
I think all Postman_Pat characters must have a big nose . 
you're holding the crayons ? 
you standing the crayons upright ? 
how many are there ? 
you going to count them ? 
what else shall we draw ? 
we could draw a tree „ couldn't we ? 
oh there's a tree . 
shall we put some apples in it ? 
a pear . 
let's draw a nice big red apple . 
<color it> [<] in . 
sometimes they have a bit of yellow on them as well „ don't they ? 
xxx that . [+ PI] 
no ? 
and a green leaf and a green stalk ? 
there . 
it looks like it might have just come off the apple tree . 
xxx . 
you wanna draw an orange ? 
that's right . 
you draw an orange . 
I've drawn a banana . 
can you reach ? 
there we are . 
an orange is round „ isn't it ? 
a circle . 
a digger ? 
there . 
<the orange> [<] +... [+ IN] 
<the orange one (h)as had> [<] a little +... [+ IN] 
bit of stalk in it . 
you'd like to get your digger ?

what's that , Thomas ? 
what do you think it is ? 
put some green leaves on it . 
it's a carrot !

you'd like the digger ? 
you wanna dig all the pencils up ?

I moved all the toy boxes yesterday so I could vacuum . 
and I've put them back in the wrong place . 
so when I went to get the digger I went in the wrong box . 
has it ? 
do you want me to get it for you ? 
it's a funny shade of orange . 
because this is a very bright orange . 
and this one is +... [+ IN]

would you like me to help ? 
there you are . 
I thought there was a blue crayon .

look . 
I was just thinking I could draw the digger man „ couldn't I . 
there's his overalls . 
his trousers . 
there we are . 
straps . 
shall we give him a pinky reddy face ? 
and there's his arms . 
how about (.) a yellow helmet ? 
he's a proper digger man „ isn't he ? 
which one have you dropped ? 
there we are . 
it's the orange one again . 
it keeps falling down „ doesn't it ? 
another one (h)as gone under the table ? 
which one ? 
the yellow one ? 
I can't see it , Thomas . 
it's in there ? 
and you've had me looking under the table ! 
you cheeky monkey . 
a green one . 
I don't know . 
perhaps it was the blue one that fell . 
there's nothing on the floor though . 
is it still in the box ? 
I don't think it is „ is it ? 
ah (.) I think it's here . 
look . 
blue . 
b@l l@l u@l e@l . 
you're putting them back in the box „ are you ? 
I don't think anything (h)as happened „ has it ? 
oh well the digger's the wrong way round . 
is it +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
is that your finger ? 
are you trapped ? 
thank you . 
you'd like to hold the box for me „ would you ? 
do you know what else you could put in the digger , Thomas ? 
pieces . 
<of this> [<] jigsaw . 
would you like this one with the animals ? 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine ? 
well if we do the animals you could give the animals a lift „ couldn't you ? 
that's right . 
a lamb . 
a horse . 
that horse is a little bit large „ isn't it ? 
shall we try the horse from this jigsaw ? 
it's not quite so big „ is it ? 
that's it . 
and what else ? 
oh look . 
there's your little train here . 
please may I set up the train ? 
oh . 
I thought we could carry some more things in the back of the train . 
no , Mummy ? 
well you can carry them . 
there you are . 
we'll put the train driver xxx there . [+ PI] 
no ? 
well he can get some things . 
how about some trees ? 
some trees ? 
and flowers . 
we might find a snail growing amongst the flowers . 
he's driving off . 
oh it's a bumpy ride „ isn't it ? 
oh and a pussy cat . 
because there happened to be a pussy cat up the tree . 
at the time the tree went into the back of the train . 
look . 
with the cup and saucer . 
that could go in the cab with the driver . 
because he might be thirsty . 
do you think he is thirsty ? 
no ? 
it is a bumpy ride . 
yes . 
and look . 
the digger can carry the cockerel . 
and the duck . 
and another duck . 
and the mother hen with her chick . 
you'd like the xxx to move now ? [+ PI] 
look . 
the digger man could have a teddy bear in his cab „ couldn't he ? 
it might be his little boy's teddy bear . 
and he could also have a clock . 
and he can tell when it's time for tea . 
oh . 
telephone . 
you could pretend it's a mobile phone . 
so he can ring his wife . 
it is a bumpy ride . 
yes . 
because you're going over all the jigsaw pieces „ aren't you ? 
it is a bumpy ride . 
now there's a car here . 
who do you think could get into the car ? 
no . 
that's right . 
no . 
we were going to put Postman_Pat (.) Missus_Pottidge and Miss +/. [+ IN] 
Miss_Hubbard in the car . 
but actually the car is too small to fit them all in . 
and yeah you're right . 
you're saying the car isn't open anyway „ is it ? 
it is a bumpy ride . 
you like saying that „ don't you ? 
bumpy ride . 
jack in a box ? 
oh you were doing that when you came home „ weren't you ? 
you were being a right silly_billy@wp with that . 
weren't you ? 
your jack in a box . 
it is a bumpy ride . 
and what you were doing hop +//. [+ IN] 
were you doing hopscotch as well ? 
and here's the farmer with his trailer . 
it looks like he (h)as got pieces of straw . 
who else might we find on the farm ? 
we wouldn't find anything on the farm ? 
what about these pigs here ? 
yes . 
the pigs might be on the farm . 
right . 
I think he's driving towards the farm house in the barn . 
don't you ? 
that is the most strange barn I've ever +//. [+ IN] 
I'm not convinced it is a barn , Thomas . 
it looks like a giant haystack . 
it is a bumpy ride . 
it looks like a giant haystack „ doesn't it ? 
with a piece of cloth on the top that's sposta keep it straight . 
I've not seen anything like that before . 
you've got quite a lot of wooden toys „ haven't you ? 
because Father_Christmas brought you a wooden fire engine . 
and a wooden train set . 
and these jigsaws are made from wood . 
what else have you got that's wood ? 
wooden [>] . 
you don't know ? 
even that fish +//. [+ IN] 
do you remember that pull along fish ? 
with all the bright colors from <Auntie> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
Auntie_Frank ? 
yes . 
Thomas , what does this Auntie_Frank business mean ? 
a red fish . 
you're telling me about when you've been to stay at Grandma and Granddad's (.) Uncle_David keeps tropical fish „ doesn't he ? 
and you went with Grandma and Granddad and Uncle_David and Auntie_Sharon to buy some new fish . 
because David said you could choose a fish to put in his tank . 
and keep it at their house . 
so that when you're there it can be your special pet . 
and you didn't just buy one fish . 
you bought two „ didn't you ? 
and one's a Daddy with a big red tail . 
and the Mummy doesn't have a red tail . 
and for some strange reason you call them both Auntie_Frank . 
now what does Auntie_Frank mean ? 
I don't know either . 
and why you call them both Auntie_Frank . 
what a silly_billy@wp . 
oh don't wipe Mummy's kiss off . 
I can understand you calling the lady Auntie_Frank . 
but not the Daddy fish . 
that should be Uncle_Frank . 
Uncle_Frank and Auntie_Frank . 
did you tell the man in the shop you were going to call them Auntie_Frank ? 
pardon ? 
it's a good word ? 
oh that's clever , Thomas . 
it's a good word . 
well it's a nice name , Auntie_Frank . 
but I don't know where you got it from ? 
and I don't know why you call them both Auntie_Frank . 
because you won't be able to tell the difference „ will you ? 
a bumpy ride . 
what do you mean you've not got anything ? 
the train (h)as stopped ? 
going [<] backwards now ? 
it is a bumpy ride „ isn't it ? 
you'd [<] like to take all those out ? 
and what about the shapes in this jigsaw ? 
yes ? 
there we are . 
made a loud noise „ didn't it ? 
where've you heard a bumpy ride ? 
did Granddad tell you it was a bumpy ride ? 
what [/] <what was he> [//] what were you doing when Granddad said “it was a bumpy ride” ? 
you don't know ? 
were you in the car ? 
no ? 
perhaps on your bicycle ? 
were you ? 
you were riding round and round on the bicycle ? 
was it a bumpy ride ? 
where did you go ? 
the airport ? 
on your bicycle ? 
well I would imagine that is quite a bumpy ride , Thomas , really . 
no smoke coming from the chimney on the train ? 
poop poop . 
poop poop . 
don't you ? 
I can't stop kissing you . 
because I've missed you so much when you were away . 
oh don't wipe Mummy's kiss off . 
poor Mummy . 
you do like Mummy . 
don't you ? 
did you miss me ? 
poor , Mummy . 
I'm very sad .

oh dear .
