+, she could always hear the fridge door opening or me opening a tin and getting her plates out of the cupboard and <her drawer> [//] her fork out of the drawer . 
but now she (h)as gone a bit deaf (.) I think it must be the smell +//. [+ N]

well how about getting out some cups and saucers and things like that ? 
saucers ? 
well would you like to get them from here ? 
well I don't think they break these , Thomas , because these are the (..) plastic ones from the tea set . 
there you are . 
we might need a tray . 
oh dear . 
if you break it we'd hafta go and buy a new one „ wouldn't we ?

you pick up a tray and [>] you walk along and you get tea and coffee out of a machine . 
and then you walk along (.) with your tray and you pick up a teaspoon and you pay the lady at the till and you sit down and eat it . 
or there are other tea rooms like the one in York (.) where you go in and sit down at the table (.) and the waitress comes along with a little pad . 
and she says what would I like . 
and that's the sort of tea room I'd like to go to . 
so if I just sort some cups and saucers out (..) can I sit down please and be the customer and you can come along ? 
<you can> [//] you can't be a waitress because waitress are ladys .

or do you call them scones [= prounces as sc-own] ? 
good boy . 
that's right . 
well I'm from Yorkshire , Thomas , and we call them scones [= prounouces as sc on] . 
but a lot of people call them scones [= pronounces as sc own] . 
but they're all the same thing . 
shall we have a look at some ? 
oh yes . 
could I have a pot of tea please ? 
would you like to write it on your little pad and then you don't forget (.) in case it gets as mad as a fire .

Mummy made a bread pudding the other day (.) and I cut all the crusts off and put them in that container to dry a bit . 
and then you know the food processor up here on the dresser ? 
under the cover ? 
I'm going to take all those bread crusts and put them in the food processor and press the button and it will go 0 [=! makes noise] (.) and they'll be turned into fine bread crumbs . 
and then I shall put them in a box and I shall use them for something else like a stuffing .

what sort of +/. [+ N] 
what sort of people come in , Thomas ? 
policemen come into your tea room „ do they ? 
<and do> [>] they have a uniform on ? 
and why do they come in ? 
because they're thirsty after a long day on the beat ? 
or do they come in because you've got someone naughty ? 
customers who don't pay ? 
mhm . 
and what happens with naughty customers who don't pay ? 
do you ring the police or do you make them go in the back and do the washing up ? 
you wash them up „ do you ? 
<oh , Thomas> [=! laughing] . 
oh you've brought me my own personal telephone to the table .

it isn't too busy (.) there's just me here . 
so if you'd like to come and join me and I'd like to have a piece of bread . 
I asked for sandwiches but perhaps he hasn't got any fillings . 
and we're going to have a scone and a nice hot cup of tea . 
take care , Daddy . 
bye bye . 
&-uh (.) just one please . 
thank you . 
oh dear . 
don't we ? 
right (.) without paying ?

<I can't believe you> [>] +... [+ N] 
you did what sorry ? 
bread rolls ? 
I can't believe you +//. [+ N] 
mind you don't tread on the wire , sweetheart . 
I can't believe you run a restaurant without doughnuts , Thomas_Henry . 
is it called Thomas's tea house ? 
oh (.) Thomas's tea shop (.) right . 
right (.) <would you> [//] are you going to have a piece of bread ? 
no . 
well this is the last piece please (.) then I'll have a scone . 
<no (.) not in> [>] there , love . 
I'll get them in a minute . 
have [<] [/] have you put the kettle on ? 
so , Thomas , if people come [>] +/. [+ N] 
ah [>] . 
guess what ? 
the red light (h)as come on up there . 
oh dear . 
perhaps we need a new battery . 
we're not doing very well with this equipment this morning . 
it's only a month since we've used it . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
we've had problems with the batterys (.) problems with the wires . 
of course [>] you can , sweetheart . 
yes [>] . 
Mrs_Sweetshop in Didsbury (.) you know the lady who runs the sweet shop ? 
we call her Mrs_Sweetshop „ don't we ? 
I went +//. [+ N] 
you don't know her ? 
Mrs_Sweetshop ? 
haven't you ? 
oh . 
well I went in the other day when you were at nursery (.) and (.) her shop was really quiet . 
there was only me there . 
and we had a nice little chat because when we go once a week after we've been to The_Beehive (.) her shop is absolutely packed full of children „ isn't it ? 
because school (h)as just finished and people like us are walking home from the park and everybody goes in (.) and <it's mad> [>] . 
oh right . 
oh that's useful . 
thank you . 
do I hafta wear it before I have my scone ? 
oh it's for boys and girl +//. [+ N] 
oh just in case some little boys and girls come and sit with me at the table ? 
well do you think it perhaps +//. [+ N] 
I tell you what perhaps a school boy (h)as been in here . 
is [<] +... [+ N] 
oh (.) well he (h)as forgotten his t+shirt . 
<how long did (.) &-um (.)> [//] how long (h)as it been here ? 
five months ? 
oh I think he would have come back for it „ don't you ? 
well rather than me taking it home shall we take it to the lost property office ? 
or shall we +/. [+ N] 
oh right . 
or we could send it to the charity shop and they could put it on a hanger and put it in a window . 
and anybody walking past who needs a school uniform could think “oh (.) I'll go in and buy that school uniform that was left in Thomas's tea shop” . 
right (.) so I think your &res [//] your tea shop is a little bit like Mrs_Sweetshop's +/. [+ N] 
+, shop [<] . 
I do (.) yes . 
I will do . 
so your shop must be just like hers . 
and that now when I've called in it's really quiet . 
but other times of the day when everyone's feeling like a cup of tea I bet it gets really busy „ doesn't it ? 
do they ? 
oh that's because you've got a lot of people (.) in the shop together and they're probably all trying to make themselves heard . 
right (.) here we are . 
come and have a look at these . 
now we had some with currants in actually and sultanas but we've eaten those . 
this one (h)as got cherries in it . 
and these are just plain . 
mhm ? 
oh yes (.) sorry (.) you've got to tell me because you're the (..) <the waiter> [>] . 
yeah . 
right (.) okay . 
are you going to come and sit next to me ? 
or would you like to just have a look here ? 
right (.) there you are . 
they're round „ aren't they ? 
do you know how we make scones ? 
we get some butter (.) some hard butter (.) <not soft> [>] . 
when we're making buns you know we get that really nice soft margarine „ don't we „ to whip up . 
well this is hard butter . 
and we rub it with flour +/. [+ N] 
I've had them (.) yes . 
you've had them as well . 
no (.) oh no because it's not nearly Christmas now „ is it ? 
well <do you know> [>] where Mummy got them from ? 
Freda ? 
you know Freda +/. [+ N] 
oh no (.) you know Freda who goes to church ? 
she [<] makes them and she gave Mummy these . 
that's how I've come to get them . 
but how you make them , Thomas , you rub butter and flour together (.) you stir in some sugar and then you either put fruit in such as currants or sultanas or cherries or you can put +//. [+ N] 
I put grated cheese in mine sometimes . 
or you can just leave them plain . 
and then +/. [+ N] 
okay . 
now listen (.) you rub them in till they look like bread crumbs . 
yeah (.) like that (.) in the bowl . 
and then you add a little bit of water or milk . 
and then you roll <them out> [>] . 
oh [>] . 
you dropped your list ? 
be &care +//. [+ N] 
oh yes (.) you roll them out and then you know the round (..) pastry cutters ? 
the biscuit cutters we have ? 
you cut them into round shapes . 
pop them on a baking tray . 
brush a little bit of egg or milk across the top and pop them in the oven to bake . 
and when they come out oh [!] they smell gorgeous and they're really warm and lovely . 
and then we keep them in a tin and eat them (.) look . 
oh ! 
now (.) you can have these on their own or you can slice them in half and put some butter on and some jam and some cream . 
but the fruit ones are nice on their own . 
would you like one of these ? 
well come and taste it because you said you wanted one . 
what (.) &-um +//. [+ N] 
have that bit because it (h)as got lots_of cherries in . 
you like cherries „ don't you ? 
when you've eaten this you can tell me what happened on Tweenies this morning . 
well eat this first . 
mm . 
mm mm . 
what do you think to that ? 
yum . 
it's nice when it (h)as got other things on it . 
would you like some jam on it ? 
mm . 
this is nice „ isn't it ? 
would you like some more ? 
mhm . 
some rubbish on the tray ? 
yes you can do [>] . 
&=laughs . 
no thank you . 
that can go in the bin now . 
mhm . 
oh tea ! 
we've not even set the table „ have we ? 
there we are . 
is [//] may I have the blue cup and saucer or shall I have red like Po ? 
well xxx because you give me a blue teaspoon . [+ I] 
which color would you like ? 
you're the waiter . 
but are you not going to join me ? 
right (.) could I have some milk first (.) please (.) in the cup ? 
a little bit of milk . 
milk first . 
actually a lot of people put milk in second but Mummy usually puts the milk in first . 
that's the tea (.) and I don't take sugar so I'm alright . 
that's lovely (.) thank you . 
would you like a little sip of this ? 
this is real coffee . 
mm . 
oh , Thomas , look the saucer's broken . 
oh look at that . 
that's a shame . 
did they ? 
no (.) don't <&brend it> [//] bend it anymore . 
leave it as it is . 
a burglar came in and did that „ did they ? 
oh dear . 
pardon ? 
are you ? 
are you going to mend it ? 
pardon ? 
be careful . 
don't break it , Thomas . 
don't break it . 
<don't pull it> [!] <because it's not> [>] +... [+ N] 
no (.) leave it please because it's only cracked at the moment . 
if you mess about with it it'll break . 
is it mended ? 
mhm . 
don't eat too much because it's not too far away from (..) a meal , is it ? 
so you were telling me before that people who come to your tea room don't hafta pay . 
well (..) Daddy and Mummy go to work +/. [+ N] 
+, to earn money . 
so we go into work to earn money (.) to pay for things . 
now <if nobody comes into your> [//] if nobody pays when they come into your tea shop +... [+ N] 
where do you get money from to then go and buy flour to make scones [= prounces as sc own] or scones [= prounces as sc on] and milk to make +/. [+ N] 
oh right . 
but surely you hafta pay the van driver when he drops all the things off „ <don't you> [>] ? 
mhm . 
if you forget he doesn't mind ? 
does that mean you normally hafta pay him ? 
but where does your money come from if you're not charging the customers anything ? 
a special van ? 
oh . 
yes ? 
oh he gets some old money out of a till and gives you new money . 
that sounds interesting . 
and you know the policeman that comes into your +/. [+ N]

I think he'd be very interested „ don't you ? 
mhm (.) I'm sure he would .

right (.) would you like some water in the milk jug as well , Thomas ? 
to [<] pretend it's milk ? 
I'll just give that teaspoon a drink +//. [+ N] 
&-uh a [/] a [//] not a drink a rinse because I was using it . 
just a moment .

it's not like the others „ is it ? 
are you going to drink this , Thomas ? 
no . 
xxx [>] . 
well this is sugar . 
this is really sugar . 
but I don't think we should drink this if we're putting that in „ do you ? 
<there we are> [<] . 
<and do you> [<] provide a menu on the table , Thomas ? 
<so that people> [<] +... [+ N] 
you don't ? 
and [<] +... [+ N] 
you don't ? 
so people can't choose what they want ? 
do you just tell them what's available ? 
or do you have a blackboard where they chalk up every day ? 
you chalk up every day what's on +/. [+ N] 
you chalk every day . 
right . 
so have you got a price list ? 
<oh you> [<] +... [+ N] 
oh I thought you didn't charge people .

you forgot to stir . 
that's right . 
oh look . 
Purdie (h)as [<] arrived now . 
she'd like a bowl of Whiskas now on the floor . 
okay . 
are you going to see to Purdie now ? 
0 [=! makes noise] . 
oh that's nice . 
thank you . 
right (.) now Daddy's on his way so let's get some ready for Daddy . 
would you like to pour some milk in the cup ? 
that's it . 
from the milk jug . 
that's it .

a little drop of milk . 
that's fine . 
now let's pop some tea in .

that's it . 
oh you're very good at pouring . 
what (h)as happened to the top half of the cup ? 
does he not get enough tea to fill it ? 
a little bit of sugar . 
that's right . 
what you better do , Thomas , is put the sugar in (.) with one spoon . 
use this red one then it matches the sugar bowl . 
put the sugar in with that spoon and stir it with the spoon on the saucer (.) because if you put this spoon into the water and it gets wet (.) it will all stick to the spoon . 
but if you use one spoon to get the sugar out of the sugar bowl and keep it in <the sugar bowl> [>] +... [+ N] 
&-uh (.) two please . 
and you can use the [/] the spoon at the side of the saucer for stirring +//. [+ N] 
how's that ? 
yeah . 
you're very good „ aren't you ? 
and do you wear a uniform , waiter ? 
no . 
right (.) are you going to stir it with that spoon ? 
oh Daddy will be pleased „ won't he ? 
oh do you think Purdie would like tea ?

there you are . 
too wobbly ? 
I don't know what (h)as happened to +//. [+ N] 
oh yes (.) the red saucer's the one that (h)as cracked „ isn't it ? 
I wondered where it had gone . 
we'll try and get some glue on that before it finally breaks . 
oops a daisy . 
&=laughs . 
right (.) are you going to make Purdie some in the green cup ? 
what (h)as she got in ? 
milk ? 
have you ? 
well you hafta tip the bowl a little bit and then the sugar will fall to the bottom „ won't it ? 
oh , Thomas_Henry , that's cheating ! 
can you not be bothered to spoon it out ? 
you've just picked the whole sugar bowl up and tipped it in . 
it's alright . 
<you can lick it> [/] you can lick it . 
right (.) is she going to have any tea in this cup of tea ? 
or is it just going to be milk and sugar ? 
talking of Purdie I can see her right at the bottom of our garden . 
look (.) the sun's on her . 
that's nice „ isn't it ? 
it (h)as been a bit cold out actually this week . 
oops [<] a daisy . 
there (.) we hafta be careful with hot tea because it could scald you „ couldn't it ? 
yeah ? 
right (.) is the green cup ready to stir the sugar in ? 
that's it . 
right (.) now we put that on the tray as well . 
and there's only one cup left so you might as well join us for a <cup of tea> [>] . 
would you like that ? 
there you are . 
there's the milk there . 
shall I put the milk in for you ? 
there you are .

you've got to have nice hot tea in . 
that's it . 
oh [!] it's a [/] it's a good strong cup of tea that „ isn't it ? 
right . 
oh that's nice . 
xxx [>] .

oh well . 
have you got a very sweet tooth ? 
there you are . 
oh , Tom , don't drink it . 
ugh@o ! 
&=laughs . 
ugh@o [>] . 
is it nice ? 
you like the sugar „ don't you ? 
you messpot . 
you're a messpot . 
oh dear . 
right (.) you'll hafta wash your hands when you're finished because you're all sticky „ aren't you ? 
right (.) shall we take take all this then on the tray and go and sit down at the table with it ? 
okay . 
right (.) tell you what (.) shall I put (..) the pot of tea and the sugar bowl +/. [+ N] 
and the milk +//. [+ N] 
that's right . 
we'll put the lid on the sugar bowl to keep the flys away . 
there we are . 
now just in case anybody's sitting down at the table wants a drop more milk or a top up (.) second cup of tea +/. [+ N] 
+, or they want some more +//. [+ N] 
<no no> [/] no . 
no (.) because that's dirty . 
there <we are> [>] . 
right (.) would you like to put [//] hand the tea out to people ? 
there you are . 
hand the whole cup . 
now be careful . 
just say “mind the tea (.) it's hot” . 
meow [/] meow . 
is that what she said ? 
thank you very much . 
she's very polite Purdie „ isn't she ? 
and whose is that cup of tea ?

oh that's nice . 
let me just drink mine . 
0 [=! making noises] . 
oh I enjoyed that . 
thank you . 
could I please have a second cup ? 
I was really thirsty . 
I've drunk that quickly . 
a teddy bear on it ? 
were we saving that in case any other customers come in ? 
I might as well just have the same cup . 
shall I put my own milk in ? 
and shall I help myself to tea ? 
right . 
and a little bit of sugar . 
I don't usually take sugar in drinks . 
in fact none of us do . 
but seeing as it's your tea shop and you enjoy serving sugar +... [+ N] 
thank you . 
right (.) shall I give it a quick stir ? 
xxx . 
<there we go> [>] . 
oh right . 
that's really nice . 
that really is nice . 
do you have any newspapers in your tea shop ? 
because sometimes when you go into tea shops and restaurants and cafes they have a stand with all today's newspapers on . 
are there ? 
so [<] people can come in „ can't they ? 
have a nice cup of tea and read today's paper . 
oh (.) I bet it's thirsty work being a waiter „ isn't it ? 
you might have some more ? 
help yourself . 
there's plenty there . 
do you wear an apron , Thomas ? 
or a uniform ? 
nothing ? 
you don't wear a hat or anything in the kitchen ? 
oh dear [/] dear . 
don't tell Daddy . 
and does the milkman come everyday to bring milk to your shop ? 
and what happens when you want more sugar ? 
do you go to the shops or does a van deliver it ? 
oh what color's the van ? 
is it ? 
and do you have a chat with the driver ? 
and do you make him a cup of tea when he comes ? 
and do you have him in with all the (..) the goods ? 
what sort of things does he bring to your shop ? 
he brings strawberries „ does he ? 
is that to slice and put on the scones ? 
and what (.) in the summer do you serve strawberries and cream ? 
that does sound nice . 
<and does> [<] the baker come as well ? 
the baker's van ? 
and what does he bring ? 
cakes or sweets ? 
do you serve sweets <in your shop> [>] ? 
oh (.) it's sounding good . 
I've been here a long time and I can't see I've seen the sweet machine . 
what <do you> [/] do you have jars on the shelf like Mrs_Sweetshop ? 
or do you have a machine ? 
mhm ? 
does it ? 
the [/] the sweets fall into a packet „ do they ? 
into a little <plastic &-uh> [//] paper bag ? 
oh that's nice . 
and how much does that cost ? 
oh I remember (.) you haven't got a till . 
yes (.) it's a bit of a setback in this shop „ <isn't it> [>] ? 
oh . 
so anybody coming into your shop , Thomas . 
can have anything including sweets from the machine +/. [+ N] 
+, absolutely free ? 
no (.) don't just eat the sugar (.) you messpot . 
nice and sugy@c ? 
ah [=! laughs] . 
oh don't thank me . 
it's your [/] your cafe [//] your restaurant . 
tell me about Mersey_Vale then , Thomas . 
at nursery you have a little area (.) set up as a restaurant . 
when you first started that was a home corner „ <wasn't it> [>] ? 
alright . 
oh , Thomas . 
mhm (.) you'll rot your teeth . 
won't you ? 
not rock (..) rot . 
rock (.) is rock that you get at the seaside . 
is long [//] a long stick (.) say pink rock (.) pink on the outside (.) white in the middle and it has the name of the seaside town or the place in the middle . 
all the way through the rock it says Blackpool [/] Blackpool (.) <Scarborough Scarborough> [/] Scarborough . 
and it often tastes minty or fruity . 
but rot that [//] is different from rock . 
rot is rot your teeth . 
you know if you eat too many sweets and sugar (.) you get little holes in your teeth and it hurts . 
and you hafta go to the dentist and that hurts as well . 
well it doesn't really hurt (.) but it's not nice having to go to the dentist . 
you hafta go and brush your teeth when you're finished being a waiter . 
so , Thomas , at Mersey_Vale nursery they had a little corner +/. [+ N] 
+, that when we first arrived last September (.) it was set up as a house „ wasn't it ? 
there [<] was a ironing board (.) a bed (.) table and chairs . 
and it (h)as been a hospital as well „ hasn't it ? 
it's not a [/] a house . 
it (h)as been a hospital . 
and did you play doctors and nurses there ? 
and now (.) it's a restaurant „ isn't it ? 
black and white . 
is it all black and white ? 
blue and white and black . 
and what happens there ? 
<do you> [/] do you play at being the waiter or a waitress ? 
or a cook ? 
come on , Thomas , talk to me please . 
what do you do [>] ? 
no (.) don't just say yeah@q . 
what do you do in that little restaurant place ? 
what happens ? 
no (.) I know you're not in there now but +/. [+ N] 
oh come on (.) you must remember . 
what did you do when you were there ? 
<did you make> [>] +... [+ N] 
you came home with a little (..) menu card [//] a little place card „ didn't you ? 
that was black (.) written in gold writing and it said Thomas . 
is that where you sat at the table (.) at place card ? 
you were one of the customers ? 
oh (.) and who was the waiter ? 
Alex ? 
and was he a good waiter ? 
and did you get to be the waiter or were you just the customer ? 
you swapped everytime [>] „ did you ? 
and did you have somebody being a cook ? 
you [<1] +... [+ N] 
<and you> [<2] [//] you were the cook as well „ were you ? 
you got a turn at being everything „ did you ? 
and when you were the cook (.) did you hafta do the waiting on as well ? 
and who was your customer when you were the waiter ? 
oh (.) Alex and James . 
and what sort of things did Alex and James ask for ? 
excuse you ? 
well because you're busy eating sugar . 
come on , Thomas , talk to me please . 
what sort of food did Alex and James ask for when they were the customer ? 
oh ice cream for the pudding . 
oh do you serve ice cream xxx in your shop . [+ I] 
do you put it in bowls or do you put it in wafers [//] cornets ? 
like the ice cream man sells . 
what do you do ? 
in wafers ? 
very nice . 
so on a hot day I bet that's lovely „ isn't it ? 
and did you hafta wash up in the restaurant at nursery ? 
and you did that „ did you ? 
the washing up ? 
very good . 
and was that good ? 
it's a good job this is near the end of the tape , Thomas_Henry , because all you're bothered about now +/. [+ N] 
+, is [/] is eating sugar . 
I only put two very small spoonfuls of sugar in the sugar bowl and it's just as well because it (h)as all gone in your tummy . 
I know . 
you're going to wash it in your tea ? 
you're rinsing it out now with +//. [+ N] 
oh well (.) it's one way to get you to drink water . 
and the cups are clean . 
I know I've just taken them out of the box but I did wash them up the other day . 
that little tea set , Thomas , was given to me a long time before we (h)ad even had you . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
that's what happens when you have too much sugar . 
it makes you cough . 
and somebody gave it to me as a little present and I kept it in a box and I thought one day I shall give this to a little child to play with . 
and then I had you . 
and when you were very [/] very young you useta like playing with this . 
you useta clang the cups and saucers and oh [!] bite +//. [+ N] 
oh you did all sorts of things . 
is that your baby voice ? 
would you like to be a baby again , Thomas ? 
no ? 
you would ? 
oh . 
babies wouldn't be able to eat sugar „ would they ? 
babies just have milk and water „ don't they ? 
oh well yes and then they're sick . 
you're quite right . 
yes . 
&=laughs . 
oh dear . 
yeah (.) sugar and water that <will probably> [>] make you sick . 
it should give you energy that , Thomas , eating sugar . 
does that mean you're going to be very lively later on ? 
yes ? 
well these little shoes that you're wearing are Mummy's . 
now you're tripping round in Mummy's shoes . 
a lot of chefs wear clogs in kitchens . 
because they're comfy to wear and they keep their feet cool . 
I know these aren't clogs . 
they're mules . 
but you look a little bit like a chef when you're wearing them . 
and chefs wear nice tall hats „ don't they „ and checked trousers . 
Daddy has got one of those . 
you're quite right . 
might you ? 
I don't know where it is now . 
in my bedroom is it ? 
<oh xxx > [>] +... [+ N] [+ PI] 
no (.) you're not . 
please don't go upstairs in those shoes , Thomas . 
you'll trip up . 
<no [/] no> [<] . 
no . 
oh_gosh (.) those stairs . 
well everything else is in the bedroom so it doesn't surprise me if chef's hat's in there . 
right . 
while you're up there , Thomas , I think you (h)ad better rinse your hands please . 
because you're bound to be a little bit sticky . 
thank you . 
is what fun , darling ? 
it looks very fun (.) yes . 
you're going to clear the tray away „ <are you> [>] ? 
you've now got Daddy's white hat on +//. [+ N] 
this [//] actually the hat you're wearing , Thomas , isn't really a chef's hat „ is it ? 
oh that's clever . 
can you manage ? 
right [>] . 
okay . 
right (.) I'll just &-um +... [+ N] 
let me just move this microphone down . 
it's okay (.) I haven't got the washing up water ready yet . 
let me stand that microphone up there . 
that's it . 
well thank you so much . 
so (.) I'm helping to wash up „ am I ? 
is this because I haven't paid anything ? 
just pretend I don't do it ? 
what do you mean ? 
did you enjoy that ? 
well while you were upstairs a minute ago you brushed your teeth „ didn't you ? 
so if you're eating sugar again I think you've got to go back up and do it again . 
<not just yet> [>] . 
did you ? 
thank you . 
right (.) well I'll wash these things . 
thank you . 
I bet you do a lot of washing up „ don't you ? 
a hundred washing up ? 
everyday ? 
oh dear . 
and do the customers ever help ? 
no ? 
<oh xxx > [//] oh thank you very much . [+ I] 
is that spare tea that people haven't drunk ? 
thank you . 
thank you very much . 
you'd be quicker if you put it on the tray , sweetheart . 
wouldn't you ? 
<if you put> [//] if you load everything onto the tray and carry the tray (.) you could make just one trip to the kitchen „ couldn't you ? 
have you ? 
it doesn't matter , darling . 
people do spill tea in tea shops „ don't they ? 
we can soon get a cloth and get it wiped up . 
I wouldn't worry about it . 
oh look at that . 
thank you so much . 
thank you . 
right . 
saucers and cups . 
<it's a> [>] +... [+ N] 
it's a pity this [>] +... [+ N] 
no more ? 
just [<] +... [+ N] 
thank +//. [+ N] 
just saying it's a pity this isn't on video because you look gorgeous in your hat [?] , Tom . 
&=laughs . 
thank you . 
you can in a minute when I've dried them . 
I'm just <washing them> [>] . 
we needta +//. [+ N] 
I think we could do with wiping the tray actually . 
and [<] +... [+ N] 
+, then we needta just wipe the table „ don't we ? 
you can . 
oh go on then . 
you lick the sugar . 
quick [/] quick . 
and then after we've finished <this game we've got to go back and brush your teeth> [>] I think „ don't you ? 
well you might be more sensible actually +//. [+ N] 
we're going to eat in a few minutes anyway „ aren't we ? 
eating a proper meal . 
we'll eat and then it will be teeth brushing time . 
<there's a> [<] lot of washing up to say that there was only myself (.) you (.) Daddy (.) Purdie +/. [+ N] 
+, as customers . 
there we are . 
right (.) <we'll just> [>] [/] just have a little look at the table . 
what's going on here ? 
just a moment . 
I'll rinse the cloth out and then you can have a good wipe <of the table> [>] . 
<you xxx > [<] . [+ I] 
shh@o [/] shh@o . 
there you are . 
okay (.) thank you . 
and what time does your cafe close ? 
midnight ! 
oh you poor little man . 
and what time do you hafta get up ? 
eight o'clock . 
and what time does the restaurant open ? 
oh right . 
well you work very strange hours . 
what about the milkman ? 
surely you miss seeing the milkman and the bread man (.) because they deliver a lot earlier than that „ don't they ? 
do they ? 
well you're quite right there because when Mummy left work the other night +... [+ N] 
it was (..) I don't know what time (.) something like (..) twenty to two in the morning . 
<when you and Daddy> [<] were fast asleep in bed . 
and there was a milk float on Kingsway and [>] +/. [+ N] 
when it was night . 
the middle of the night . 
and I thought perhaps he was just driving from somewhere . 
but oh no (.) the milk float stopped (.) the little milk man got out and he went running up and down paths with bottles of milk . 
so when those people got up in the morning at either six (.) seven or eight o'clock in the morning (.) they (h)ad certainly have milk . 
they wouldn't be waiting for the milk man „ would they ? 
are you wiping the seats as well ? 
well that's good „ isn't it „ because if people are eating things like scones and sandwiches and sausages and tomato <and having sugar> [>] +/. [+ N] 
yes . 
ah (.) well you're very [/] very good „ aren't you ? 
did you see Mummy doing that earlier on today ? 
you saw Mummy +/. [+ N] 
yeah . 
yeah (.) that's right . 
there's a &lit [//] there is actually some sugar on that chair at the back , Thomas , I can see . 
there we are . 
people are going to come again and again to your restaurant if the food's good and it's nice and clean „ aren't they ? 
and did you say you didn't have a toilet downstairs or was it just you [//] you've got a toilet in the restaurant ? 
<oh right> [<] . 
I see <because Bob the> [>] +... [+ N] 
oh right (.) because that's where Bob_the_Builder was . 
he hadta go and use the toilet „ didn't he ? 
do you ever find you have people coming in who just wanna use the toilet and don't want a cup of tea ? 
oh [<] and do you mind that ? 
you don't mind ? 
you're very [/] very generous „ aren't you ? 
and do people leave you nice tips , Thomas ? 
oh no [/] no . 
don't pull the table out , Thomas , please . 
no (.) you mustn't <touch that> [>] chair . 
<no no> [/] no . 
<no , darling> [<] . 
please don't pull the table out (.) you'll hurt yourself . 
it's too heavy . 
right (.) let me see if I have any money . 
I'll have a little look in my purse . 
what (h)as happened to it ? 
oh it's here . 
there we are . 
where's my shopping bag ? 
look at this . 
there you are . 
that's for being a very [/] very good waitress . 
well not waitress (.) sorry (.) waiter (.) cook (.) bottle washer (.) everything . 
I've enjoyed myself . 
thank you . 
bye bye [>] . 
I'll see you again . 
okay . 
bye bye [>] . 
right (.) okay . 
oh might you ? 
<you needta wash> [<] +... [+ N] 
you needta wash under the table as well ? 
who does [>] ? 
oh . 
who eats under the table , Thomas ? 
babies . 
ah . 
do you not have high chairs for babies to sit in ? 
well I don't think my +/. [+ N] 
oh why aren't they allowed ? 
so in case you've forgotten to clean the high chairs ? 
and the chairs are dirty (.) you just put babies straight under the table „ do you ?
