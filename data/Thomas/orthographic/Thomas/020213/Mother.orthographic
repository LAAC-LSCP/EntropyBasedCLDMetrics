while you're eating those Mummy's going to iron her dress . 
I've got to go out in a little while .

Mummy's pouring water into the iron .

Winnie_the_Pooh and Tigger .

I can't get it off now . 
yes oh dear .

there will be a mess if I spill it . 
I tell you what . 
I shall leave that in the trainer beaker because you can drink it later in the day . 
and I'll make you some more <(.)> [>] straight into this cup . 
straight into the cup . 
are you going to be a good boy today ? 
with Nan and Grandad ? 
I think you're usually a good boy for them „ aren't you ? 
oops a daisy . 
it's a good job Mummy hadn't poured the juice in straight away because I've dropped the cup .

I don't think I'll do that again , Thomas . 
you frowned at me then . 
was it terrible ? 
was Mummy's singing awful . 
suppose it would help if I knew the words „ wouldn't it ? 
got it on the tape „ haven't we ? 
po@c juice . 
does it taste extra special out of a grownup cup ? 
I suppose it's getting to the stage now +/. [+ IN] 
+, when you'd probably prefer to drink out of a [/] a cup now . 
and we keep the training beaker with the lid on for when we're traveling somewhere . 
so you don't spill it . 
what's Mummy doing now ? 
pouring herself a cup of tea ? 
oh Thomas . 
do you hafta make so much noise ? 
don't forget to finish your cornflakes while you're busy with your juice . 
otherwise you'll fill up with liquid and not have anything to eat . 
I can't seem to get the ironing board in the right position . 
there we are . 
Mummy ironing her dress ? 
can you hear the iron ? 
it's going psh@o . 
do you remember Percy in your Thomas_The_Tank_Engine books , Thomas ? 
Percy whooshed steam everywhere . 
and this is steam but it's a different type of steam from the train . 
this is steam from the iron . 
choo choos whoosh . 
Percy whooshed steam everywhere but he would not move . 
can you see the steam coming from the iron ? 
just watch . 
there you are . 
can you see that steam rising . 
whoosh . 
I don't know what's making more noise . 
the steam iron or you slurping juice . 
looks like it's going to be a nice day today . 
the sun's shining .

yes I know you said please but will you please eat some cornflakes first . 
you don't wanna play at eating cornflakes ? 
no . 
brush a tree ? 
yes that's what you do and you really shouldn't do that . 
you take the brush from the garden don't you . 
and you take it towards the trees and you brush the trees . 
Mummy doesn't like you doing that but you've seen Isabel do it „ haven't you ? 
yes you have . 
so anything Isabel does you think you can do as well . 
doesn't matter too much at home but you can't start going to other people's gardens and picking up their brushes and brushing their trees „ can you ? 
oh dear . 
oh dear me . 
did you drink it too quickly . 
quick quick . 
we've got to be quite quick quick this morning „ haven't we ? 
because Mummy's going to work . 
before I go out I've got to iron this and I must address an envelope . 
so you can help me with that . 
and then perhaps later on (.) you'll have a walk to the postbox with Grandma and Grandad to post it . 
postbox a blue door . 
no the postbox is &ye [/] red . 
at the end of the road . 
the red postbox on the wall . 
actually I don't think it is on the wall . 
I think it stands on the floor . 
what's the postbox like , Thomas ? 
it's red . 
yes it's red . 
but is it a box ? 
I go to it every day and I just can't think . 
is it a big red box where we post the letters ? 
we write cards and letters and put them in envelopes . 
address them put stamps on them and then we post them in the postbox . 
and the postman comes along in his van and he empties the box and he collects all the letters in his sack . 
and if he sees you he waves „ doesn't he ? 
is that what you say when drives off ? 
see you bye postman . 
see you man . 
the postman . 
like Postman_Pat . 
meow meow ? 
yes Postman_Pat has a black and white cat „ doesn't he ? 
that rides around in his red van . 
we know a song about that as well but I'm not going to sing it .

I'm being a steam train . 
I'm doing Percy whooshing steam everywhere . 
yes . 
that's the cup with Winnie_the_Pooh and Tigger . 
Pooh_Bear's lying down . 
is that a picture of Tigger ? 
is that where he's saying grrr@o . 
Tigger the tiger . 
sounds like you enjoyed that . 
a bus . 
where's a bus ? 
where's the bus ? 
let Mummy have a look . 
I can't see a bus , Thomas . 
no bus . 
Thomas . 
that's a funny noise . 
it's not very polite to do that „ is it ? 
you're going to a wedding tomorrow so I hope you don't start making noises like that . 
otherwise we might be thrown out . 
think we might hafta play at being quiet tomorrow morning . 
where (h)as Daddy gone ? 
at the door ? 
no . 
Daddy's at work „ isn't he ? 
I can't see anybody at the door . 
Bow door ? 
Purdie at the door ? 
no . 
Purdie's not at the door either „ is she ?

she possibly is . 
she was asleep before „ wasn't she ? 
yes . 
oh you're back on your cornflakes . 
ooh they're nice .

took a long time to iron that this morning „ didn't it ?

go and find a coat hanger for this .

oh dear Thomas . 
why is it always a nice day when I hafta work ? 
I beg your pardon . 
more juice ? 
you sound as if you've had enough . 
would you like some bread now ? 
just put the ironing board away . 
that's it . 
down it goes . 
that's the ironing board , Thomas . 
yes I've stood it behind the vacuum cleaner in the cupboard . 
noonoo@c . 
noonoo@c . 
hello noonoo@c . 
there we are . 
more juice . 
what do you say ? 
please . 
Mummy made some bread yesterday . 
bread . 
look at that . 
when I finished baking it last night <the crust was> [//] the top was crusting . 
and then I wrapped it in foil and it (h)as gone quite soft now . 
ooh . 
we'll slice it with the red knife . 
gosh . 
it's like sawing . 
it's very soft „ isn't it ? 
very soft . 
ooh . 
bread . 
now would you like some nice soft cheese on that , Thomas ? 
some spreading cheese ? 
big bread . 
it's quite a big loaf „ isn't it , that ? 
that's a loaf of bread . 
spreading the butter on the bread . 
Thomas . 
you're making some dreadful noises . 
there we are . 
spreading butter . 
and some cheese . 
think we'll cut this into four because it's quite a big slice . 
no there isn't a bear . 
why do you keep looking towards the window and saying no bear . 
have you seen a bear walk past the window ? 
tell you what there is . 
there's no bear but there's some Teletubbies on this plate . 
Tinky_Winky and Po . 
and La_La and Dipsy drinking Tubby custard . 
there you are . 
I hope you enjoy that bread . 
choc_choc@f bread Nana . 
yes . 
well when Nana comes she may very well have some chocolate hidden in her bag . 
but I don't think it's the first thing you should say when she walks through the door , Thomas . 
it might be nice to say “hello Grandma and Grandad how are you nice to see you” . 
no [=! laughs] ? 
I think that would be far preferable to “Nana choc_choc@f a@p bag” . 
poor Nana . 
poor Nana . 
anyway you're being a bit presumptuous because Nana might not have chocolate in her bag . 
wrap the bread up in this silver foil . 
what color is the foil ? 
silver . 
oh yes . 
I suppose it looks a little bit like a hat now „ doesn't it ? 
looks like Dipsy's hat . 
now we've wrapped it up and stick it up like that . 
Mummy (h)as got a cup of tea . 
oops a daisy . 
so far you're just sucking the cheese off the bread „ aren't you ? 
and not actually eating bread . 
does it taste nice ? 
bread . 
put those back in the +//. [+ IN] 
oh I've forgotten to put cheese on my bread . 
you useta eat an awful lot of breakfast , Thomas , even if you did not wanna eat the rest of the day . 
you always useta eat a lot of breakfast and you don't seem to now . 
what're you talking about ? 
choo choos . 
does that mean that you would eat your bread if I gave you your trains so that you could put your bread inside ? 
choo choo choo choo [=! sings] . 
yes . 
there we are . 
let's sit the little man in the trailer . 
he might like some bread and cheese , Thomas . 
yes darling . 
yes my darling . 
no there aren't any chocolates . 
more juice . 
you've still got some cornflakes left and you've got bread . 
shall Mummy peel you an apple ? 
a door a box ? 
have you just seen the postman ? 
I haven't seen him but I thought I heard a noise . 
oh now the dog's barking next door , Thomas . 
I see the postman (h)as been . 
yes . 
there's a bill for Daddy and a bank statement . 
so that will really cheer him up when he gets home „ won't it ? 
yes Daddy (h)as gone to work ? 
it's a good job he (h)as gone to work because it looks like he (h)as got some bills to pay when he comes home . 
no it's not a peach it's an apple . 
just get some kitchen paper to peel it into . 
look at the kitchen paper , Thomas . 
it (h)as got a picture of lemon limes orange . 
a picture of a lemon . 
and limes . 
and an orange . 
that's what this is . 
yes . 
are you going to eat some bread , Thomas ? 
I didn't make any toast this morning because you don't seem to have been too bothered about toast recently . 
oh look who's here now . 
no it's not Daddy . 
look on the floor . 
who's that ? 
here behind you . 
it's Puss . 
it's Purdie . 
good morning . 
Purdie <Puss> [?] . 
Nana and Grandad at the door ? 
are they here already ? 
I hope they're not . 
oh no . 
good . 
because Mummy's not dressed . 
what would Grandma say if she rang and Mummy wasn't dressed ? 
she would say “oh dear what a mess” . 
wouldn't she ? 
yes . 
oh that's very clever . 
you've sat the driver of the train right behind the chimney . 
you've never sat him there before . 
that's very clever . 
yes . 
oh you're pulling the trailer apart . 
have you seen that the driver's head turn round , Thomas ? 
look . 
so when he's going right he can turn right . 
when he's going left he can turn left and look left . 
and because he's a special driver he can turn his head all the way round when he wants to go backwards . 
a special doctor who was going to do something to her neck . 
yeah . 
Nana at the doctor . 
that's right . 
Nana at the doc^doc@f . 
so I think when she arrives we'd better ask her how she is . 
oh dear . 
have you dropped it ? 
when Nana arrives say “Nana how's your poorly neck” ? 
rather than Nana choc_choc@f a bag . 
can't see where you've dropped it , sweetheart . 
I heard it fall . 
there you are . 
there's some apple . 
choo choos . 
four pieces of apple . 
Thomas . 
what happened to the train ? 
oh you've stacked all the apple into the trailer . 
oh dear . 
have you just run the train driver over with the train ? 
that's a shame because his [/] his head was facing backwards . 
he should have seen the train coming and got out of the way quick quick „ shouldn't he ? 
eat some apple , Thomas , please . 
mhm . 
that taste good ? 
mhm . 
is his head turning round and round ? 
is he stuck ? 
Sue door ? 
can you see Sue at the door ? 
I can't her there today . 
I can see Sue's door but I can't see Sue . 
hello Sue .

aah I see what you're saying . 
you want <the driver of the train> [//] your little man to have some tea . 
would you like to give him a drink from your cup ?

and before Grandad retired „ where did Grandad work ? 
Grandad worked at the chip shop as well ?

Grandma worked at the chip shop .

no Thomas . 
oh no don't bang that on the table .

that's a jade . 
a jade type color „ isn't it ? 
oops a daisy .

Mummy (h)as dropped one of the crayons .

are you getting it stuck again ?

Mummy's nose is running a lot this morning , Thomas . 
sneezing a lot . 
are you still drawing ?

are you still drawing Grandad's card ?

are you going to do some more with the green pencil ? 
that's beautiful „ isn't it ? 
he'll be really proud .

Nin_Nin's going to paint her nails now while you're busy doing that . 
we've hadta do Grandad's card today „ haven't we ? 
because you can give it to him today . 
he won't open it until Sunday . 
but it would be nice if you gave it to him . 
what're you saying ? 
Nin_Nin's just doing her nails (.) with pink nail varnish .

what's stuck ? 
have you got a crayon stuck ? 
oh yes I can see it . 
it's down there .

blue and green . 
that's really lovely . 
oh you've got a crayon in each hand . 
you're doing them together . 
painting with two crayons . 
in between sipping juice .

I don't know who that is . 
somebody (h)as just pushed something through the letterbox . 
because the postman (h)as been already „ hasn't he ? 
think he brought Daddy some bills . 
it's another brown envelope for Daddy . 
but it's a big brown envelope and it's something to do with work . 
are you going to do some more coloring ? 
ooh there's a red crayon . 
there . 
oh you've tripped [?] it . 
all the crayons out now . 
a mess ? 
all gone . 
the crayon pot's empty now „ isn't it ? 
pardon you , Thomas . 
excuse you . 
would you like to draw a line or something with one of each of these and then put it back in the pot ? 
so we do a pink line and the pink pen back in the pot .

would you like to try one ?

so she can sell them . 
is that the lid from the pencil pot ? 
how many shall we put in a bag , Thomas ? 
oh dear . 
one two three four . [+ R] 
shall we do four or five in a bag ? 
think we'd better do five „ don't you ? 
that's the lid from the pencil pot . 
there we are . 
put five biscuits +//. [+ IN] 
five biscuits in each bag like that . 
do they look alright ? 
and then Mummy's going to put some ribbon on the top to tie them . 
that's one lot of five . 
you count with me while we're doing the rest . 
now who's coming this morning to look after you ? 
yes . 
one two three . [+ R] 
four . 
we'll take some from this tray now . 
four . 
five . 
because some are nicer than the others „ aren't they ? 
there we are . 
five in that bag , Thomas . 
you talking about your trains ? 
have you finished drawing ? 
because if you have you might like to put <the pots> [//] the pencils back in the pot . 
two moons ? 
two suns ? 
is that because you're holding yellow and orange crayons ? 
yes there's blue there . 
are you going to help me count out some more ? 
would you like to try one ? 
look . 
before you do that let's put all these pencils away . 
where (h)as the pot gone ? 
let's put all these pencils away and then you can try one of Mummy's biscuits ? 
have you got room for a biscuit ? 
there should be twenty four crayons and I could only find twenty three yesterday . 
but I know that one (h)as gone underneath your highchair . 
oh Thomas . 
don't put them on the floor . 
we're trying to get tidied up quickly „ aren't we ? 
no . 
now don't do that . 
they're nice colors „ aren't they ? 
the table must be on a slope because all the crayons are rolling off „ aren't they ? 
good boy . 
thank you , darling . 
just let me count them . 
www . 
so we've actually lost four . 
I can see one of them . 
but I don't know where the rest are . 
oh dear dear dear . 
right . 
finished your Grandad's card „ haven't we ? 
you'd like to try one of these ? 
well let's try one that perhaps we don't think we're going to sell on the stall . 
there you are . 
yes . 
Mummy (h)as got to wash her hands now because (.) just (.) blown my nose . 
yes . 
blown my nose . 
and you can't touch food . 
not food . 
especially not food that you're going to give to somebody else . 
without wiping your hands „ can you ? 
washing your hands . 
one two three four five . [+ R] 
what do you think to Mummy's biscuits ? 
what does Thomas think to Mummy's biscuits ? 
do you think they taste quite nice ? 
want more biscuits ? 
well we've done five packets of five „ haven't we ? 
I think this might hafta be the last one . 
they're quite healthy biscuits these „ aren't they ? 
they've got oats and honey . 
they've got brown sugar in them . 
one two . 
three . 
four . 
which one +/? [+ IN] 
oops a daisy . 
which one shall we choose as the last one ? 
one two three four . [+ R] 
how about that one ? 
one two three four five . [+ R] 
one two three four five . [+ R] 
now I could actually make another bag up with another five . 
but they're a little bit misshapen „ aren't they ? 
what're you doing ? 
shall we do one more bag ? 
now whoever buys these are going to have biscuits that are slightly smaller than the ones that are in the other packets . 
but there's nothing the matter with them . 
and providing we put them all in the same bag , unless somebody buys two bags , they're not even going to know „ are they ? 
they're not even going to know , Thomas . 
all out . 
no . 
xxx all sorts „ can't we ? [+ PI] 
one two three four five . [+ R] 
now how about because they're smaller than the others we put six in this bag ? 
six instead of five . 
what do you think ? 
I think that's a good idea . 
and then if they do buy another bag and think ooh these are small compared to the other bag they can count them . 
they can count them and what will they find when they count them ? 
oh as many as that ? 
now that is value for money „ isn't it ? 
and we've got some bread baking „ haven't we ? 
actually that won't quite be ready I think when Sue comes . 
so you'll hafta keep her talking „ won't you ? 
you'll hafta keep Sue talking so Mummy has time to get the bread out of the oven . 
but at least when she takes it away she'll know it's freshly baked because it'll still be hot „ won't it ? 
oh now we've run into problems with putting six in a bag , Thomas . 
because the bags really only properly take four . 
there we are . 
how many bags ? 
one two three four five six . [+ R] 
six bags and how about we put these two that are left , a little bit misshapen , on a plate for Grandma and Grandad . 
that sounds awful „ doesn't it ? 
all done . 
all done . 
right . 
we've just got to put some ribbon round the top there . 
and Mummy's going to be a pig and eat these crumbs look . 
there's a teaspoon . 
well Mummy (h)as got to taste what she's selling „ hasn't she ? 
mm mm . 
more biscuits . 
yes . 
bit early in the day for eating biscuits really . 
isn't it ? 
there we are . 
biscuits all done . 
just going to take this tray outside and I'll throw it out for the birds . 
throw it out for the birds . 
oops . 
pity we didn't see Purdie before we threw that . 
oh dear dear . 
oh poor Puss . 
did Mummy throw the crumbs ? 
and we didn't know Purdie was there . 
I don't think we quite hit her but it frightened her „ didn't it ? 
poor old Pussy cat . 
yes . 
if it's you not hassling her it's me „ isn't it ? 
was a mistake though . 
when you run up to Purdie you know jolly well what you're doing . 
oh dear Thomas . 
that's what happens when it's a nice sunny day . 
Mummy likes the sun but it makes her sneeze . 
Thomas . 
we've got some yellow green and blue check ribbon here . 
check . 
checked material . 
think we'll use some yellow . 
snip snip snip . 
that's some green ribbon left from Easter . 
I don't think there's quite enough to tie a bag . 
can use the yellow piece . 
<there we are> [<] . 
just twist the top like that . 
and tie the knot . 
and once we've tied the knot we can make a bow . 
so Mummy's sending them all those jars of marmalade . 
lemon marmalade . 
two loaves of bread . 
one that we made last night . 
and [<] the other one that's in the oven now . 
and all these biscuits . 
xxx [<] . 
look at that . 
what do you think to that ? 
yes . 
using the scissors look . 
cutting it . 
that's called a slant , Thomas , or an angle . 
we're not cutting straight across . 
we're cutting it from side to side . 
side to side . 
only we're not cutting it because the scissors aren't very good . 
I'll just go and get some different scissors . 
yes . 
snip^snip@f . 
we've got some different scissors „ haven't we ? 
these have got red handles like the others but these are smaller . 
two snip^snip@o . 
two pairs of scissors . 
pair of snip^snips@f . 
that's right . 
when you've got +/. [+ IN] 
when you've got more than one thing (.) when you have two things <(.)> [>] sometimes you call it a pair . 
it's different from the sort of pear that you know . 
oops a daisy . 
did that go down the wrong way ? 
down the wrong way . 
you're like a parrot this morning „ aren't you ? 
pap^pap@c . 
that's what your word is for parrot „ isn't it ? 
a pap^pap@c . 
xxx . 
shall we use the blue ribbon now ? 
when Mummy (h)as done this we've got to put another coat of varnish on her nails . 
whiz upstairs and do some makeup . 
and then Grandma and Grandad should be here . 
and Sue should be here . 
and Mummy's going to go then to work . 
yes . 
no , Thomas . 
don't put crumbs on the floor . 
if you're going to start being messy when you're sitting in this big chair at the big table we'll hafta start thinking about putting you back in the highchair „ won't we ? 
where you can only get the crumbs on a small tray . 
yes . 
just a second . 
let Mummy finish tying this . 
is that what you want ? 
the train again ? 
so that you can put your biscuit in it and they'll be able to ride round . 
but , Thomas , don't make a mess . 
please don't make a mess . 
no . 
it make [//] takes Mummy a long time to tidy up and we really haven't got time . 
no mess . 
no time . 
no do . 
no mess no time no do . 
do you like the ones with the blue ribbon ? 
or the yellow ribbon ? 
I don't think we can use the green ribbon „ can we ? 
did the biscuit just fall over on its own then or are you making a mess ? 
Thomas . 
Thomas . 
don't make a mess with food . 
right this is the last bag now . 
no mess . 
no . 
you've put the biscuit in the trailer „ haven't you ? 
there's still a lot of crumbs on the table . 
I think you like riding the wheels over biscuits „ don't you ? 
to break them up . 
big splash a choo choos . 
yes I'm going to hafta wash them „ aren't I ? 
we hafta wash your trains after every meal „ don't we ? 
because what happens ? 
they get in a mess „ don't they ? 
yes . 
why don't you eat some more ? 
would you like to eat some more ? 
you're probably full though because you've just had breakfast „ haven't you ? 
yes . 
that's next door „ isn't it ? 
you can hear the door closing next door . 
Linda's house . 
what happens tomorrow ? 
Linda's getting married „ isn't she ? 
Linda and Brian next door getting married . 
we're going to a wedding . 
your first wedding , Thomas . 
oh this is very fiddly@n . 
you <wouldn't believe> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
<you wouldn't believe Mummy> [<] was in a rush „ would you ? 
no you can't . 
oh no no no no no . 
you can't have that to put in your train , darling . 
no no no . 
we're going to give this to Aunty Sue . 
don't think &-uh (.) she needs to put them in a tray to get them where she's taking them . 
right that's it . 
the ribbons are all going away now . 
back in its bag .
