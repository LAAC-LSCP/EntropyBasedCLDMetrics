do you remember watching on the television program that big sorting machine ? 
all the letters were going past 0 [=! imitates machine noise] very quickly „ weren't they ?

that's called a postcode .

where the letter's going too .

look . 
this one . 
can you see ? 
that tells us where it was posted and what time and what day . 
and that stamp goes right across . 
that mark goes right across the stamp . 
so it means you can't use the stamp again .

and where are they going when they get on the aeroplane ? 
where are they going ? 
to see Sue ? 
and where does Sue live ? 
in the green engine ? 
or are you meaning that's where the [/] the suitcases go ? 
in the green engine ? 
because it looks like it's a luggage trolley to me . 
not a passenger carriage . 
I can hear a plane as well . 
we must have reached the airport . 
oh yes . 
you want Harold_the_helicopter with the pilot ?

have you seen the plate that the apple's standing on ? 
it's a Thomas_The_Tank_Engine plate „ isn't it ? 
the bread's easier to cut today „ isn't it ? 
it was a little bit too soft yesterday . 
do you remember when I tried to cut it yesterday ? 
the knife went all over „ didn't it ? 
because the bread was so soft . 
couldn't manage to cut it in a straight line . 
I've done it today . 
I'll put some jam on this bread and then if you'd like to share it with me you can . 
what kind of jam is it ? 
red jam ? 
what's it made from ? 
raspberry jam . 
that's right . 
it's made from raspberries . 
quite a lot of seeds in it „ hasn't it ? 
you can't talk „ can you ? 
because you've got apple in your mouth . 
you've taken such a big bite . 
you can't talk because you've got apple . 
hello . 
pardon ? 
can't tell what you're saying , Thomas . 
silly_billy@wp . 
aren't you ? 
I'll just move that sharp knife before you get hold of it . 
if I cut a little piece of bread off and put it on the plate with your apple is that alright ? 
what are you talking about ? 
the driver from the digger ? 
oh is he going to have some bread and jam ? 
do you think he would enjoy that ? 
no ?

eating Lalas ? 
what are Lalas ? 
you're being silly . 
eating Lalas ? 
do you mean bananas ? 
bananas ? 
baby nanas . 
you're very into bananas at the moment „ aren't you ? 
oh yes . 
you like bananas ? 
and big apples . 
well you've always liked apples . 
and when you were a baby you useta have a banana every day . 
mashed up . 
and then suddenly you went off them . 
that's probably why . 
because you had it too much . 
and now you're into bananas again . 
and you had two yesterday . 
two bananas ! 
one at breakfast and one just before going to bed . 
oh no . 
don't drop them on the floor . 
that taste nice ? 
the raspberry jam's nice „ is it ? 
good . 
that's a piece of bread . 
I didn't bother putting the bread in the toaster today . 
because when it's fresh baked bread it tastes nice without being cooked „ doesn't it ?
