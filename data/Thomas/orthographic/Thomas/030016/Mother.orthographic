can you not get into your chair ? 
there you are . 
you do what love ? 
pardon . 
I don't know what you're saying . 
but you've come out with a long list of things like flowers trees cauliflowers . 
I thought you were just looking out of the window but we haven't got cauliflowers . 
now you've started saying things likes and Tweenies . 
cauliflowers are vegetables . 
they're not flower flowers . 
sprouts . 
no . 
sprouts are vegetables . 
brussel sprouts . 
yes . 
carrots are vegetables . 
no . 
well apples are fruit rather than vegetables . 
anything that has a little pip inside +//. [+ IN] 
+, is really a fruit not a vegetable . [+ IN] 
so if you open things like oranges and apples +... [+ IN] 
or seeds as well . 
seeds . 
oh seeds are in your Teletubbie pots . 
yes . 
we did that a few weeks ago „ didn't we ? 
planted some seeds in your Teletubbie pots . 
well they're little flowers that we planted called [>] something like candy tuft . 
the only thing that worries me is that +/. [+ IN] 
pansys . 
well Mummy (h)as put some pansys in the hanging baskets „ hasn't she ? 
the Teletubbie pots are growing flowers . 
that's right . 
the only thing that worries me , Thomas . 
is we've had a lot of rain and Mummy didn't put holes in the bottom of the Teletubbie pots . 
well because I forgot . 
silly Mummy . 
and so when it (h)as rained the soil (h)as got very wet and I'm a bit worried that it (h)as been too wet for the flowers to grow . 
and the other thing . 
it looks to me as if there there might be some seeds on the table . 
I'm just wondering whether the [/] the soil has washed over the seeds . 
come on . 
let me just go and get them . 
right . 
well I can see the xxx . [+ PI] 
right . 
now be careful because it's full of dirty water . 
can you see all the seeds we've planted have actually come to the top of the soil „ haven't they ? 
so what we must do +/. [+ IN] 
we won't do it now because we're going to have breakfast . 
I'll put it back on the table and then +/. [+ IN] 
well the table outside . 
and then I shall do something else with them . 
I shall put some more soil on top . 
put some holes in the bottom for drainage . 
they've really risen to the top „ haven't they ? 
yes . 
we'll put some holes in the bottom . 
what might be a better idea actually , Thomas . 
is if you put them into a different container and keep the Teletubbie pots as they are . 
and we can use those as little plant pots for when you're growing things like mustard cress . 
so let's have a look at the some flowers you planted . 
now you did this at toddler group „ didn't you ? 
who did that with you at activity time ? 
Lynne . 
Ben and Charlotte's Mum Lynne did that . 
now actually I think it's time for these to go into the garden because they're +... [+ IN] 
when four shoots appear +... [+ IN] 
these are called shoots , Thomas . 
these little leaves . 
oh be careful . 
there's nothing really to smell „ is there ? 
when four shoots appear it's time to put them (.) into something else . 
and you see we were only sposta plant one sunflower seed and we must have planted [>] +/. [+ IN] 
it's in a beaker „ isn't it ? 
we must have planted +... [+ IN] 
one two three four five six seven seeds we must have used in that little pot and it's really +... [+ IN] 
the pot is too small now so we'll choose a place in the garden . 
what might be a good idea is <if we> [/] if we put say four in one place and three in another . 
<and then> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
no . 
these are called sun +/. [+ IN] 
these are called sunflowers . 
yes , darling . 
a buzzy^bee^tree@c . 
oh yes . 
that's &-um +... [+ IN] 
oh I can't think what it's called . 
the name escapes me , Thomas . 
but yes . 
in a few weeks +... [+ IN] 
because we're in April now . 
I'd say possibly May June . 
June probably . 
lots_of little flowers will come out on that . 
&-uh Lavateria . 
is that what it's called ? 
oh no . 
I don't think it is . 
oh I don't know . 
I'm hopeless . 
that tree over there that is now on Fred and Rachel's garden that useta be Sue and Andy's is called Budleigh . 
and that has sort of bluey purpley flowers . 
and it attracts butterflys . 
you keep watching . 
no . 
don't do that . 
you keep watching that tree and all the butterflys will come to it . 
I think these are called Laveteria but I'm not sure , Thomas . 
no . 
don't because it'll make a mess of the windows . 
I don't want that . 
thank you . 
I think it's raining now . 
look . 
isn't it ? 
look at the [/] the path . 
so yes . 
bees come to that . 
and we've got lots_of flowers in the garden that are going to get pink flowers on them . 
and we've planted those little primroses or Primulas whatever they're called . 
xxx [<] . 
the pot on the grass . 
which one ? 
the green one . 
the orange one on the grass . 
I can't see one on the grass . 
oh yes . 
I can . 
oh right . 
well that must be one that had these little Primulas in . 
when Mummy was doing the planting I must have dropped that one and the wind (h)as blown it down there . 
and do you see what these are ? 
this long tub here . 
we've got honey suckle and sweet peas in that one . 
that one had a dahlia . 
it's just the bulbs and the root you can see now . 
we're going to plant that under the trees . 
&-um there's ivy in these hanging baskets and this big tub down here have [/] have ivy in them . 
ivy climbs up the walls . 
you'll never ever touch the plants outside to eat them „ will you ? 
never [/] never touch the leaves , Thomas . 
or [/] or try and taste them because some of the leaves if you get them on your fingers it'll make your fingers itch and itch and itch . 
and you'll tickle . 
and you never ever eat them because things like the ivy will make you very poorly if you eat that . 
and sick . 
you don't want that „ do you ? 
and you see those big tubs up there . 
those square tubs . 
in those we've got strawberry plants . 
nice . 
and do you see the two twigs that are sticking up with leaves on them . 
they're apple trees . 
and that fancy shaped container +/. [+ IN] 
well no . 
&-uh I don't think we'll get any fruit this year but we'll plant them . 
and then next Summer we might get some apples and then you can bring them in and eat them „ can't you ? 
that fancy shaped tub is really Mum's herb planter but I've <not put herbs in it> [>] . 
are you bored with this gardening session now „ are you ? 
that (h)as got sweet peas in it . 
and look . 
and can you see what this is ? 
this terracotta pot with the holes inside . 
can you see ? 
that's actually called a strawberry planter , Thomas . 
that pot . 
and it (h)as got mint which we have with lamb . 
and it (h)as got sage and oregano growing . 
and they smell nice . 
shall I just go and get you a nice mint leaf ? 
just let me go and get one of them . 
yes . 
I can't really smell all that well , Thomas . 
this is mint . 
actually you can hear the birds „ can't you ? 
in the rain singing . 
that's lemon „ isn't it ? 
that's not the mint one . 
I'll just go and get the mint . 
now this is called lemon balm . 
you smell that . 
do you like that ? 
can you smell lemons ? 
I can . 
I think that's a beautiful scent . 
sometimes in the Summer +/. [+ IN] 
that's a mint . 
that's like toothpaste and polos . 
look at this one . 
this is what we put on pizzas . 
you're not impressed „ are you ? 
no . 
it smells more like a crocodile . 
you wanna got to the railway station this morning . 
I don't think so , love . 
I've got to go to work . 
did you see those tall thin things ? 
that we got +/. [+ IN]

well we've got some +... [+ IN] 
I'll get you some lavender .

Fireman_Sam , you smell that . 
that's lavender .

if you put lavender in the room it's sposta make you go to sleep quickly so I might try that in your bedroom . 
and this . 
this is another sort of mint . 
this is more spearmint . 
you smell that . 
now can you +... [+ IN] 
does that really smell like toothpaste ? 
do you ? 
these little leaves +... [+ IN] 
little lemons ones are beautiful . 
in the Summer evenings , Thomas . 
when you're sitting outside on the patio . 
and it's a warm night . 
just a little bit you get all those beautiful smells . 
that's why Mummy has so many of those herbs and things . 
we've got orange thyme and lemon thyme . 
and a beautiful tangerine thyme . 
the tangerine thyme +/. [+ IN] 
good bye . 
I thought we better have our breakfast now „ don't you ? 
Alan_Titchmarsh . 
&-um . 
where did you drop a leaf ? 
I think I picked it up , poppet . 
but we [/] we must sort out those candy tufts or whatever they're called . 
seeds . 
otherwise they're not going to work „ are they ? 
they're too xxx . [+ PI] 
pardon . 
teddy bear book . 
well we'll have our breakfast and have a look at those later . 
yes . 
it's wet outside , Thomas . 
that's a shame „ isn't it ? 
and then we've got this pretty tub here . 
that's the tub with lavender in . 
look . 
can you see there's a beautiful daisy plant next to it ? 
can you see all those pretty daisys . 
big daisys . 
much larger than the ones you get in the grass . 
so we've got lavender a white daisy with yellow centre and then some little blue and lilac pansys . 
that's a pretty tub „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
I think I need a drink after all that talking . 
I'll just wash my hands . 
and at the bottom of the garden we have a [/] a blackberry bush . 
and we've got a xxx berry bush . [+ PI] 
right at the bottom . 
you can't see them yet . 
there's no fruit on it but we've still got some xxx berries in the freezer „ haven't we ? [+ PI] 
from last year . 
they're like little raspberries . 
you need some . 
I tell you what they're really nice when they're still frozen . 
they taste like ice lollies when they're frozen . 
I'll just see if I can get some . 
I think we might actually +... [+ IN] 
xxx something else . [+ PI] 
let me have a look . 
I can't just see them , Thomas . 
I think they're right at the bottom of the freezer . 
ah here they are . 
it's alright . 
I've got some . 
guess what else we've got in the freezer . 
some mince pies from Christmas . 
oh no . 
no . 
Father_Christmas didn't forget to eat the mince pie we left for him . 
these are mince pies that Mummy made after Christmas and I think we've got about three left in a container in the freezer .

you certainly can , love . 
yes . 
they taste ever so nice when they come out of the freezer . 
we use these when we're making crumbles and pies . 
and they're nice just to have with ice cream „ aren't they ? 
in fact when they've come out of the freezer +... [+ IN] 
you taste one . 
it might be a bit sharp actually . 
they're not quite as sweet as a raspberry . 
is it cold ? 
it's like eating an ice lolly „ isn't it ? 
leave them to just thaw if you like but +... [+ IN] 
I tell you what else is nice . 
grapes . 
green and black grapes if you wash those and dry them . 
and put those in the freezer and take them out you can eat them like ice lollies as well . 
bite into them they're really juicy . 
a bit too cold . 
it's like eating an ice lolly though . 
just bite a tiny bit off . 
bite a tiny bit off .

you've dropped it . 
oh it (h)as wobbled there . 
there you are .

shall Mummy eat it ? 
or shall we leave it at the side until it (h)as thawed out a bit ? 
I'll pop them on a little dish . 
and then when they've thawed out xxx . [+ PI] 
you wanna put it in a container . 
<oh no> [<] .

that's +/. [+ IN] 
no , darling . 
because I've got that washed ready to put some pasta in there . 
there we are . 
I haven't cooked it yet . 
will you remind me we've got some mince pies in the freezer ? 
and one day when we want something nice to eat we'll get mince pies out and pop them in the oven to warm . 
it's hot cross bun time a the moment „ isn't it ? 
Easter .

I'll hafta go to the shop to get some more .

Bob_the_Builder .

I don't think we actually bought those from Tesco's . 
yes . 
it does sell them . 
I better pour my cup of tea „ hadn't I ?

I can see Aunty_Linda's hanging basket with some pansys in just peering above the fence . 
pansys have little faces . 
do you remember we looked at those when we went for a walk the other day ? 
we stopped at that old gentleman's house because he (h)as got the most gorgeous garden „ hasn't he ? 
lots_of pansys . 
and he had tulips and daffodils . 
he had all sorts „ didn't he ? 
lots_of nice smelling flowers . 
wall flowers . 
those are the very nice smelling flowers . 
Aunty_Linda and Uncle_Brian have those on the front . 
and it's quite nice because we get the smell when we come in the house „ don't we ? 
you wanna get out and have a wee . 
&-uh .

Alice .

Alice next door's dog gets out of Aunty_Linda's and Uncle_Brian's house „ does it ? 
and goes and has a wee on the grass . 
like a spider . 
&-um . 
I can't say I've ever seen a spider having a wee , Thomas . 
but still . 
if you want a wee you'll ask Mummy for your potty „ won't you ? 
no . 
not outside . 
&-uh I know you like to be private but I'm not putting your potty outside . 
you'll get wet anyway . 
it's cold .

nice and crunchy . 
0 [=! sighs] . 
I never got round to repairing your windmill „ did I ? 
do you remember in March we had those very strong winds ? 
you might even have been March . 
it might have been earlier than that . 
I can't remember . 
march . 
march [/] march [/] march [/] march [/] march . 
go . 
stop . 
no . 
a different type of march . 
the month of March , Thomas . 
January February March April May June . 
there were very strong winds and it blew some petals off your windmill „ didn't it ? 
and I've got the petals . 
I just haven't stuck them back together yet . 
inside . 
I'll hafta bring it inside to glue it together , won't I ? 
one of the many jobs I should have got round to doing . 
I just haven't done yet . 
I tell you what there is at the front of the house , Thomas . 
do you remember where those daffodils and tulips are growing right near the road ? 
there's some dandelions . 
and two of them have gone to seed . 
I think we might get those in and have a look . 
dandelion clocks we call those . 
do you remember the program with Aunty_Mabel and Pippin ? 
and what happened ? 
no . 
I think we're on a different program , Thomas . 
some how . 
oh that's the daffodils . 
<oh I> [//] oh that's clever . 
oh I see . 
you're saying you clip [>] . 
xxx all you clip and then you put them in boxes . [+ PI] 
and then they go into a big lorry with lots_of wheels . 
you're doing the parade „ aren't you ? 
clapping your hands and whistling . 
oh that's right . 
Aunty_Mabel and Pippin on the “come outside programmes” did two programmes . 
one about dandelions and one about daffodils . 
on the daffodil program it showed Aunty_Mabel planting bulbs „ didn't it ? 
and they cut the inside of a bulb so you could see . 
and you could see the shoots growing . 
and Aunty_Mabel and Pippin went to Lincoln where the year before Pippin had planted a daffodil bulb [/] bulb in the daffodil fields and watched it grow . 
and then it showed you the [/] the factory „ didn't it ? 
pick it . 
yes . 
where they [/] they collected the daffodils . 
they picked them from the fields . 
and then what did they do ? 
in the factory . 
and the ladys and gentlemen counted them into bunches of +... [+ IN] 
do you remember how many daffodils where in each bunch ? 
you remember a song about daffodils . 
what's the daffodil song ? 
a story about daffodils . 
I remember the story about daffodils as well . 
&-um she says trying [/] trying to think . 
I don't actually really , Thomas . 
no . 
I remember the one about dandelions . 
I can't remember the story about +... [+ IN] 
oh yes . 
I do . 
yes . 
I do . 
anyway in the factory they collect them into bunches of twenty „ don't they ? 
and they pack them in boxes with a little label saying “English daffodils” . 
and then they went into a very cold room . 
do you remember that cold store ? 
and they were loaded into lorrys and taken to the shops to be sold . 
and the end of the daffodil season when <all the plants had been> [//] all the flowers had been boxed and all the work had been done they had a parade „ didn't they ? 
that's [<] right . 
whistles and bang [/] bang [//] bang^a^drum@c . 
I'm not quite sure of the words but that was the tune „ wasn't it ? 
and Aunty_Mabel and Pippin were riding a float „ weren't they ? 
and what was the story about the daffodils , Thomas . 
I do remember . 
it was the one where the daffodil blushed „ wasn't it ? 
all the daffodils in the bunch had opened apart from one . 
and the other daffodils were saying +"/. 
+" why don't you open ? 
and she said +"/. 
+" because I'm shy . 
+" I'm frightened my face mightn't be beautiful . 
so when she opened up she had a beautiful face and they told her how nice she looked . 
and what color did her face go because she was embarrassed ? 
it went red „ didn't it ? 
all the other daffodils were yellow and she was there with a red face . 
because she was the prettiest of them all . 
and then there was a program with Aunty_Mabel and Pippin and the dandelions . 
right . 
you're still talking about the dandelion one . 
the program started with Aunty_Mabel on her hands and knees doing some gardening „ didn't it ? 
she was planting some bulbs . 
and then she went into the house and she was pottering@n around putting flowers in vases and things . 
and she tidied up quickly and she accidentally threw one of her gloves away „ didn't she ? 
when she came to tidy up she only had one glove and she said to Pippin +"/. 
+" where's my other glove , Pippin . 
go and find it . 
and Pippin couldn't find it „ could he ? 
and then later on in the evening Aunty_Mabel was putting the vase of flowers on top of the piano and she heard +//. [+ IN] 
what did she hear ? 
crash@o bang@o wallop@o . 
and she said +"/. 
+" goodness gracious . 
+" what's that ? 
and she went outside and Pippin had tipped the dustbin upside down and there were bottles and cans and all sorts everywhere . 
and he was rummaging through the rubbish and she said +"/. 
+" Pippin , whatever are you doing ? 
and he came out of the dustbin with Aunty_Mabel's +//. [+ IN] 
glove . 
and she said +"/. 
+" oh Pippin , you are a +//. [+ IN] 
Pippin , you are a clever dog . 
that's right . 
because he was clever „ wasn't he ? 
finding her glove . 
hm: . 
who do you think tidied up all the rubbish that had fallen out of the dustbin ? 
oh that was another story about rubbish and recycling „ wasn't it ? 
they went to xxx [//] visit the rubbish dump and Pippin ran away „ didn't he ? [+ PI] 
in the dustbin^tip@c . 
yes . 
I'm always saying he but actually Pippin's a little girl . 
she's a she . 
and the story about the dandelions is quite different . 
we've been looking at dandelions ever since „ haven't we ? 
because Aunty_Mabel and Pippin went to London one day and they were looking +... [+ IN] 
even in the city they were saying that dandelions grow „ weren't they ? 
even amongst concrete and all the buildings because dandelions grow by little seeds „ don't they ? 
those little white +... [+ IN] 
when the dandelion flowers die +/. [+ IN] 
after the dustbin^tip@c some butterflys . 
do you mean you watched a program about butterflys after the rubbish program ? 
did a butterfly jump on Aunty_Mabel's hand ? 
and was it a pretty butterfly ? 
what did it look like ? 
can you describe it to me please ? 
it was more like purple and blue „ was it ? 
oh that sounds like a pretty butterfly . 
that sounds very nice . 
there's one or two things that fly around in the air like bumble bees and wasps . 
they're alright as long as you don't upset them . 
if they get cross with you they sting you . 
but lady birds and butterflys are pretty little things „ aren't they ? 
one day you saw a ladybird „ did you ? 
and did you try to reach up really high to catch it ? 
but you couldn't . 
and what do lady birds look like , Thomas ? 
they're small like fairys . 
oh that's a nice description . 
they've got little wings as well „ haven't they ? 
like aeroplanes . 
pardon . 
oh that's very true . 
yes . 
if a ladybird's house caught fire then you're a fireman „ aren't you ? 
Mummy useta have a little purse when I was a little girl . 
I've still got it actually . 
and it looked like a ladybird . 
it had a little black face with red eyes . 
goodness me . 
I thought that aeroplane was going to come through the house . 
wow . 
that's loud . 
you wanna go in that boy's red house again . 
that's where Robert lives . 
I thought the aeroplane was going to go in Robert's house . 
gosh that was so low . 
that was frightening . 
well we can't go in now „ can we ? 
well because it's breakfast time . 
you don't go and visit people at breakfast . 
oops a daisy .

and a zip right down the middle . 
jumped on my lap .

these are all clean . 
what does that one say ? 
it's called a caterpillar . 
it says +"/.

you mustn't eat leaves . 
never eat leaves . 
do you remember when we went to the park especially round Christmas when we were looking at the holly berries ? 
what did we say about the holly berries ? 
you don't know . 
we said we must never ever [/] ever eat berries . 
well the butterflys might . 
they're for birds „ aren't they ? 
the birds eat the red berries . 
we never ever eat the red berries [>] . 
and holly leaves are very prickly and very sharp so we hafta stay away from those . 
here's the one with the orange tree on . 
look . 
do you know what that creature is ? 
what is it ? 
you don't know . 
it's a grasshopper . 
it says +"/.

they're getting dirty . 
I don't wanna hafta wash them again . 
keep them over that side please . 
don't get them in your breakfast . 
Mummy's going to hafta wash them again .

well you're talking now about that little song we sing at &-um toddler group . 
it's the old song the two little dickie birds sitting on a wall . 
one named Peter . 
one names Paul . 
we've got new words „ haven't we ? 
we've got two little caterpillars crawling on the branch . 
one called Betty . 
and one called Blanche . 
no . 
crawl away for caterpillars . 
crawl away Betty . 
crawl away Blanche . 
crawl back Betty . 
that's right . 
and we've got two little goldfish swimming in a tank . 
one called named +//. [+ IN] 
and one named +//. [+ IN] 
swim away Freddie . 
come [<] back Freddie . 
Frank [<] . 
but I was talking about your [/] your book about the very hungry caterpillar . 
what did the caterpillar turn into ? 
a beautiful butterfly . 
right . 
let's put those away now because they're getting all dirty , Thomas . 
let's put them on this pile here . 
thank you very much . 
never mind . 
you can have that one . 
frog says croak^croak@o . 
I can't make a good frog sound . 
what are you saying ? 
there's not room for another . 
I think you must have worn some of those bibs more than others because some are really faded „ aren't they ? 
the pictures are quite faint . 
so we were talking about the dandelion story . 
dandelions grow by +... [+ IN] 
when the flowers have disappeared +... [+ IN] 
when the bright yellow flowers have disappeared we get these white fluffy balls of seeds and they're called dandelion clocks . 
and when the wind blows them or somebody brushes past them all the little seeds float into the air . 
and wherever they land if there's a little bit of soil +... [+ IN] 
even in cracks and crevices they can grow „ can't they ? 
<a new &dan> [//] a new dandelion . 
we've seen a lot around . 
in fact we've got an awful lot on the grass in the front . 
and when Aunty_Mabel and Pippin came home +/. [+ IN] 
they walked up the path . 
and Pippin had been brushing against the [/] the dandelions and he got seeds all in his coat . 
and before going into the house Aunty_Mabel said +"/. 
+" let me brush your coat . 
so she brushed him quickly with her hands . 
and all the seeds flew into the air . 
and the following year she had lots_of dandelions in her garden „ didn't she ? 
from the seeds . 
white dandelions . 
the dustbin men . 
where ? 
where , darling ? 
near Sue's house . 
the dustbin men's house . 
I don't know . 
no . 
it's not dustbin day because the dustbin men come on a Monday . 
and it's a Wednesday . 
right . 
would you like some toast now , poppet ? 
or just some ordinary bread or a hot cross bun . 
nothing . 
what about an apple ? 
an apple . 
yes please . 
pardon . 
apple and tomato sauce . 
I think not , Tom . 
we've still not talked about that story with the dandelions „ have we ? 
there was that lady called +... [+ IN] 
what was she called ? 
Missus +/. [+ IN] 
Missus_Price . 
&-um oh I thought she was just called Missus . 
but anyway Missus_Price is a good name for her . 
and in her beautiful garden she had some lilys „ didn't she ? 
and the lilys were beautiful elegant tall white flowers and they useta sit +//. [+ IN] 
oh there's Molly behind you . 
look . 
Molly's on the fence . 
and they useta sing a little song . 
and they were very proud flowers „ weren't they ? 
because they knew they were so beautiful . 
and one day Missus came out of the house with a garden [//] gardening basket . 
what are they called ? 
trogs@n or trugs . 
I don't know . 
but you know the sort of basket I mean „ don't you ? 
look . 
Molly's +... [+ IN] 
oops she (h)as just missed our strawberry plants . 
0 [=! giggles] . 
and she wondered slowly in her Wellingtons along the garden . 
and the lilies who had always been really snobish to the dandelions and said +"/. 
+" oof you're spoiling our beautiful lily patch . 
when they saw Missus coming along with her gardening basket and her secateurs@s:fra they were laughing saying +"/. 
+" ha she's coming to pull out the weeds . 
+" she's going to get rid of you because you're spoiling our beautiful looks . 
yes . 
she didn't snip one of the dandelions „ did she ? 
she snipped the lilys . 
she collected all the lilys . 
and then what did she do with them ? 
she put them indoors in a vase of water . 
and stood them on a window sill . 
and they did look very nice in vase but they stood inside looking out . 
and once you cut flowers , Thomas . 
and bring them inside the house they don't last as long as they do when they're left outside . 
and now all they could do was look out at the dandelions who were still enjoying the sun and the rain . 
and so the lilys might have thought the dandelions were weeds but Missus was quite happy to have them in the garden „ wasn't she ? 
I [/] I like to keep the dandelions because I think they're quite pretty . 
and the daisys on the grass are sweet as well „ aren't they ? 
they get chopped up every time we cut the grass but they soon grow back . 
I don't know whether you've noticed but the daisys at night time +/. [+ IN] 
when it starts to go dark +/. [+ IN] 
the daisys close up . 
the little petals shut . 
you see these big daisys here . 
that's right . 
when the sun shines in the sky the weeds open . 
and the [/] the little daisys open . 
these big daisys here don't close . 
the small +/. [+ IN] 
big apple . 
that's nice . 
shall I just wipe these few crumbs ? 
they shut their petals and got to sleep . 
they hide the yellow centre „ don't they ? 
they go to sleep . 
the garden centre . 
the garden centre . 
yes . 
you go to the garden centre quite often with Grandma and Grandad „ don't you ? 
and where else do you get plants from ? 
B and Q . 
yes . 
you see Grandma and Grandad go to the garden centre and spend a lot of money „ don't they ? 
and Mummy goes to B and Q and buys a tub of value pansys because Mummy's like that . 
ha . 
it's probably why Grandma and Grandad's garden looked nicer than ours . 
pardon . 
&-um . 
oh that's the other thing . 
when Grandma and Grandad go with you to B and Q you always go to Mulgrave_Road_Station [?] „ don't you ? 
and park the car . 
oh look . 
there's a slug on one of Mummy's herb leaves . 
I put some slug pellets around but I didn't think to do the herbs because I didn't think they were interested in those . 
look . 
on that +... [+ IN] 
can you see that little slug ? 
like a caterpillar on that leaf . 
can you see it ? 
he must be hungry . 
that's like the very hungry caterpillar „ isn't it ? 
munching through leaves and everything else . 
he was a big fat caterpillar . 
I think it's a little slug but it does look quite small . 
it looks more the shape of a caterpillar „ doesn't it ? 
and what else do you do when you go to the garden centre with Grandma and Grandad ? 
do you ride round in the trolley ? 
you just walk now „ do you ? 
but you have been in trolleys „ haven't you ? 
you're a big boy now . 
I keep forgetting . 
would you like some jam on toast , Thomas ? 
no thank you . 
and do you know what these flowers are called in this vase ? 
carnations . 
and what color are they ? 
and we've got some more on the mantelpiece . 
I don't know whether you can see them from there „ can you ? 
they're white and pink . 
can you see that little bush right at the bottom of the garden behind your slide ? 
the red one . 
that's called the burning bush . 
because when it goes red at this time of year +/. [+ IN] 
it looks like the bush is on fire because it's so red . 
and next to that we've got that little Azalea . 
yes . 
that's right . 
if it was on fire you'd rush out and with the hose pipe „ wouldn't you ? 
and turn the water on . 
and the [/] the plant that you bought me for Mothering_Sunday +/. 
we've planted that near the burning bush . 
I can see nice pink flowers on it . 
now can you see those flowers on the Welsh_Dresser ? 
well the bunch hanging down with the blue and white and the ivory colored flowers +/. [+ IN] 
they're dried flowers . 
they were fresh ones . 
they looked like these [>] flowers growing . 
&-um [/] &-um . 
are you very interested ? 
&-um [/] &-um . 
well those are flowers that I carried when Aunty_Trisha got married . 
at her Wedding Mummy was a bridesmaid along with Aunty_Sharon . 
and we had pretty blue dress and we carried those flowers . 
and the blue flowers are dried but the white and the [/] the ivory flowers they're dried roses and dried Gypsophelia or Gypsophola tied with a little ribbon „ aren't they ? 
they were fresh when we carried them but then I brought [>] them home and dried them . 
and do you see these flowers here ? 
now those are [//] were one day red roses . 
and again there's white gypsy and ivory roses and lilys . 
and those +... [+ IN] 
the roses were roses that Daddy bought Mummy before you were born for Valentines_Day . 
you were born in April and Daddy bought them for Mummy in February . 
so I dried the roses and with them I put <the white> [//] well the ivory roses <and the lilys> [>] . 
pardon . 
oh after that big strawberry you nearly felt sick . 
yes . 
one day you put in +... [+ IN] 
in fact it was last week when Nana and Grandad came . 
you put in such a big piece of strawberry . 
you put a big piece of strawberry into your mouth . 
so big that you were nearly sick „ weren't you ? 
that was silly „ wasn't it ? 
like this big apple . 
yes . 
but you wouldn't put that all in at once „ would you ? 
because you've got to crunch it and chew it before you swallow it . 
and the lilys and roses in there , Thomas . 
were the flowers that Daddy gave Mummy +/. [+ IN] 
when you were born . 
because the day you were born Daddy went to the florist or at least the following day because you were born at night +... [+ IN] 
the following day Daddy came to the hospital with some flowers . 
<I don't> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
&-um . 
you've put your foot on the table . 
that's not good manners „ is it ? 
Daddy came to the hospital with some flowers just like flowers Mummy had in the Wedding bouquet . 
two ones . 
you're going to put two feet on the table „ are you ? 
no . 
it's not nice putting feet on the table „ is it ? 
no [/] no [/] no [/] no , Thomas . 
no . 
you don't do that . 
that's naughty . 
by gum if you did that at somebody else's house they'd never ever invite you again . 
oh xxx they'd say what a naughty boy that Thomas_Henry „ wouldn't they ? 
are you sure you don't want some of this ? 
and we've seen blossom on the trees „ haven't we ? 
that's the other sort of flowers we've seen a lot of at the moment . 
what color is the blossom ? 
pink and blue . 
oh I think it's pink and white . 
some's pink and some are white . 
we haven't really got a lot of blossom in our garden „ have we ? 
but a lot of the neighbors have . 
and when we were going to Didsbury the other day do you remember the &-um beautiful pink trees ? 
it was at the petrol station with Jo and Tony „ wasn't it ? 
and Becky . 
and man . 
well man's Becky's Dad and Jo's husband . 
he's Tony not man . 
pardon . 
the man driving the car . 
yes . 
he drove the car . 
well I think what happened , Thomas . 
Jo and Becky hadn't been to the toddler group before „ had they ? 
at Fielden_Park [?] that we went to yesterday . 
and we invited them along as our guests and Jo's husband was at home and had the car . 
don't bang . 
so he said he would give us a lift . 
and because <he give> [//] he gave us a lift there and back when it came to paying the pound to get into toddler group I said to Jo I would pay her money . 
instead of her paying because if [/] if Mummy hadta get on the bus or <go on a> [//] go in a taxi it would have cost me a lot more than a pound . 
so Mummy offered to pay and Jo didn't want Mummy to . 
so when we got to the petrol station and Jo paid for her petrol she got some change and she gave Mummy a pound to pay me back for the pound I lent her . 
and I said no . 
I don't want it . 
and I [/] I just put it on the seat „ didn't I ? 
so when Tony got back in the car he sat on it . 
he didn't realize it was there . 
but he would find it when he got out of the car . 
because you know how we tell you to share . 
you do that when you're grown up as well . 
that's right . 
we were sitting the car and we saw an ambulance with a siren go past . 
what did it say ? 
&-um . 
oh by the time Becky heard the siren and she looked up it had gone past . 
and you told her you've missed it „ didn't you ? 
yes . 
you want me to get your little ambulance for you . 
right away . 
I'll hafta find it first , Thomas . 
guess what (h)as happened to one of the lights . 
it looks like one of the flashing lights from the top has fallen inside . 
but &-um +/. [+ IN] 
just be careful with it because I'm [/] I'm sure Daddy can mend it for you , Thomas . 
if you're careful . 
Daddy's at work at the moment but when he comes home tonight . 
because he did have a look at it last night and he said +/. [+ IN] 
he said +/. [+ IN] 
it is very dark down there . 
the light (h)as fallen in . 
he said he would hafta get a long screwdriver . 
a very narrow long screwdriver to fix it . 
so we're very +/. [+ IN] 
a hammer . 
no . 
I don't think a hammer would help . 
is that how the light (h)as fallen in ? 
oh that doesn't help „ does it ? 
has it ? 
has the caterpillar crawled away ? 
oh yes . 
onto the holly bush . 
I don't think we've got a holly bush . 
we've got some heather . 
that's the other thing xxx quite xxx . [+ PI] 
oh don't make a noise with that , love . 
because it's early in the morning and we're having our breakfast . 
and I don't really (.) wanna listen to a siren thank you . 
can you see we've got flowers on the curtains ? 
they're not real flowers but patterns . 
have I missed the ambulance's nee_nas@c ? 
it's a bit noisy , Thomas . 
look . 
can you see on your plate there are some flowers ? 
right . 
let's just pop that on there . 
do you know what that is ? 
the ambulance is driving round the plate „ is it ? 
Thomas , what's on the plate ? 
tell me what you can see . 
it's not a slug . 
what is it ? 
no . 
what is it ? 
it's not a holly bush . 
what is it ? 
it's a butterfly . 
look . 
the rabbit's picking some flowers . 
there are some more flowers growing on <the lawn> [//] the grass . 
oh what's this little mouse sitting +/. [+ IN] 
it's on a toadstool . 
I can see the lights flashing . 
yes . 
&-um . 
yes . 
one of the little blue lights has fallen inside the ambulance . 
oh dear dear . 
Daddy said you would need a very tiny screwdriver like the screwdriver Mummy uses to tighten up her glasses . 
but that one was too short . 
we need a very long thin screwdriver . 
I'm sure he'll remember about it , Thomas . 
he [/] he did say he was going to get a screwdriver . 
well I don't know whether he'll get it from Tesco . 
I think he (h)as got one already that's probably just in the car . 
in the garage . 
hm: . 
perhaps . 
hm: . 
yes . 
well there are three lights on that ambulance „ aren't there ? 
two at the front and one at the back . 
and it's one at the front that (h)as fallen in . 
there's still one at the front and one at the back . 
do the headlights flash as well , Thomas ? 
&-um . 
yes . 
they're headlights . 
do they flash as well ? 
oh they do „ don't they ? 
and what about the back ? 
is there anything at the back ? 
another flashing light . 
wow . 
a small fire engine with no nee_nas@c . 
that's an ambulance „ isn't it ? 
a fire engine . 
would you like to finish these xxx , darling [>] ? [+ PI] 
oops [>] . 
who (h)as come along ? 
it doesn't look like a fire engine to me . 
it's a white fire engine . 
it's not . 
it's an ambulance . 
are you going to eat these xxx , Thomas ? [+ PI] 
they're not cold now . 
have a bite of that . 
it smells dirty . 
how can it smell dirty ? 
it smells beautifully fruity . 
it's a bit sharp . 
xxx . 
you like things that are nice and sweet „ don't you ? 
what do the Tweenies sing ? 
that little song about the fire engine . 
oh it didn't blow that many times . 
you're singing +"/. 
+" the runaway train ran down the hill and she blew . 
no . 
I was meaning the [/] the one <the Teletubbies> [//] &-uh the Tweenies sing . 
have they ? 
have they got a real fire Jake and Fizz ? 
oh I see . 
right . 
did they ? 
Jake and Fizz came in the fire engine „ did they ? 
to have a look . 
each line of the song one of the Tweenies goes away the number of firemen goes up . 
who said it was too noisy ? 
Fizz . 
is it usually Milo that makes all the noise <in the Tele> [//] in the Tweenies ? 
he's a bit like you then „ isn't he ? 
Isabel likes Milo and I think Daddy said he [//] she likes Milo because Milo is the noisy one . 
that note . 
it's a sticker on the ambulance . 
it's a [/] a sign with a red cross . 
red cross means first aid in an emergency . 
Sue's car . 
she (h)as not gone to work .
