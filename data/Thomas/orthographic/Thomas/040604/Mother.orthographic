stop messing about . 
are you having milk or not ? 
right (.) well use your spoon and not fingers .

mhm . 
he might be (.) yes . 
why did the chicken cross the road ? 
I don't know . 
wanted an egg &san +//. [+ IN] 
yes it was probably laying an egg for my breakfast . 
mhm . 
<the eggs> [>] are really nice . 
why don't you try it ?

if you don't have milk on Rick_Krispies they don't snap (.) crackle and pop „ do they ? 
oh that's +//. [+ IN] 
no , Thomas , stop it please . 
pardon ? 
yes [>] but look at the floor . 
look at the mess . 
there is a mess . 
no it's not funny [>] . 
I do . 
I am tucked in . 
it's just I'm bigger than you so I hafta sit further back . 
my tummy's bigger than yours . 
<well you've> [<] got a [//] you're sitting on the dining room chair but you've got a booster seat „ haven't you ? 
a little [/] a little plastic seat that raises you up a little bit higher . 
and also because it raises you up (.) it pushes you back <and a bit &for> [//] a bit more . 
so you're much nearer the table than me . 
well that chair you've &al +//. [+ IN] 
you useta have a high chair when you were a baby . 
in fact (..) at first when you were drinking milk we useta just hold you . 
nurse you . 
oh I useta tickle you . 
and then when you were a little bit older you had +... [+ IN] 
you know your rock a tot ? 
do you remember your rock a tot ? 
you useta sit in there and we useta spoon feed you . 
and then when you could sit up we useta have a high chair there . 
right in front of the welsh dresser . 
and then when you got too big for you high chair we bought this little booster seat . 
and we useta have straps on it . 
do you remember we useta hafta strap you in so you didn't fall out ? 
in fact that came with a tray . 
you see this bit here ? 
you can clip a plastic tray across there so it's like a high chair . 
oh I don't even know where it is . 
it's probably in the loft now . 
&-um (.) but it was really great because that flat [//] folds flat . 
so when we went to visit Grandma or I useta take you to Sonia's I useta (.) take the booster seat and then whatever chairs they had at their table we could clip your seat onto it . 
but then as you've got a bit older you haven't needed the straps . 
and you can sit really on a dining room chair now but you're so low down that I think we'd better stick to that chair . 
and you won't (.) you'll only be able to see the top of the table . 
mhm . 
yes [?] [>] . 
<no (.) eat> [<] nicely . 
no , Thomas . 
come on (.) table manners . 
what's the matter with you today ? 
I think you needta go back to bed . 
pardon ? 
you can sit and laugh ? 
sit and laugh all day through ? 
<because you're> [>] sitting laughing ? 
well you'll be hungry . 
then your tummy would hurt . 
your tummy would hurt because you were hungry . 
and it would hurt because you'd spent all day going ha^ha^ha@o . 
because it hurts your tummy muscles when you laugh too much . 
mhm . 
eventually when you stop laughing and you eat . 
I've got to do some ironing today , Thomas . 
mhm . 
we can have a little play . 
I've got to do some ironing . 
we've got to post some letters . 
we needta go to the shop . 
and one more play . 
yes we can do quite a lot of play today . 
we [<] could . 
well Mummy's got jobs to do in between . 
well I do that anyway . 
I think we could have a little play and then I could say “right I needta some ironing” and while I'm ironing we could talk . 
or we could watch something on television . 
or you can play and tell me what you're doing . 
and when I go to post the letters you can come with me . 
well I can't leave you on your own . 
no . 
Purdie's out anyway . 
is who up there ? 
mhm . 
just the post box . 
yes . 
no (.) you can come with me to the post office . 
when we first moved in Purdie useta come for walks with me . 
she useta walk all over . 
I remember going out one day it was really quite hot . 
it was the first summer I had here with you and you were in your pram . 
and I pushed you round the estate (..) and Purdie followed and she was so hot she hadta keep stopping for a breath . 
and you know the people who we call the Bxxx who live behind us ? 
she lay on their grass (..) and I carried on walking and got home and she didn't come for ages afterwards and she's never been for a walk since . 
I think she was so tired . 
I'm glad really she doesn't come because the road useta worry +//. [+ IN] 
but <she was> [//] she stuck to the pavement . 
she just useta follow exactly where we'd been . 
because when we lived in Didsbury (.) Purdie came for a walk with Mummy every night . 
when I'd finished work I useta go for a walk and Purdie useta trot with me . 
oh yes (.) she'd still come . 
she never crossed roads . 
she just useta trot behind me . 
I didn't hafta cross roads . 
I made sure I went somewhere where I didn't hafta cross roads . 
and then we moved to here and she useta follow me and then as I say this one hot day +//. [+ IN] 
you [/] you were born in April so it must have been perhaps June or July (.) maybe August . 
and I set off with the pram and she came along (.) and never saw her again . 
she must have decided that day it was too far and she was too hot . 
I wonder actually +//. [+ IN]

<for that very reason> [>] . 
it's rude .

<and Fido> [<] +//. [+ IN] 
it useta sit there +//. [+ IN] 
all the cars that useta drive into Streetname Drive it useta look at them . 
and then it would xxx turn its head slowly and watch them drive round the corner . [+ PI] 
and you always felt like you were being watched .

<we set out> [//] we went out of front door and we turned left .

the brown mart [?] ? 
xxx sound like a bear . [+ PI] 
so went left past Linda and Brian's . 
and all the way around there . 
right past here past Kathleen's house . 
and round this way . 
so she would have hadta have passed Fido on the corner (.) to get back here (.) and I wonder whether he looked at her and she got far too a bit upset . [+ PI] 
and you were only a baby and I needed to get back quickly . 
but I remember coming in the house and being a bit worried that she hadn't come with me . 
but then a while later she turned up (.) so +... [+ IN] 
but it was &ni +//. [+ IN] 
I useta like her coming for walks but &-um (.) I always worried in case she would go on her own .

we've got a harness and a lead for Purdie . 
I don't know where I got hers either but (.) when I first got her and she was very poorly she was on lots_of tablets . 
you know when you're poorly and you feel very sleepy and you don't really know what you're doing ? 
<you think so> [?] [>] . 
right . 
well (.) when we first got her +... [+ IN] 
the vet said because she was quite poorly (.) he said don't let her out on her on because she'll get confused and lost . 
so he said put her on a lead and so we did and she useta walk on a lead . 
and then when we useta go and stay with Nana_Bealby and I useta take Purdie with me because she wasn't familiar with the rounds +//. [+ IN] 
well not the rounds (.) but where Nana lived in the village I useta (.) when I hadta take her out I useta put her on the lead the first couple of times . 
just to get her useta walking around . 
anyway she's now nineteen years old Purdie so she's not done so bad , Thomas „ has she ? 
she's been knocked down before . 
she has been knocked down . 
she had broken legs when I met her . 
we went to stay with Nana_Bealby once and she [/] she ran into a car (.) and broke her leg again . 
that's why +//. [+ IN] 
have you seen Purdie coming downstairs limping ? 
if you watch Purdie come downstairs her right back leg +//. [+ IN] 
have you seen ? 
+, she's always got it up . 
four paws and one leg up ? 
well that must mean she has five legs . 
well that's why (.) because her right back leg's been broken twice . 
and now she's getting old she's probably got some aches and pains in it . 
you know like arthritis . 
well (.) it's what Nana has . 
now [?] when you get old (.) your bones wear out .
