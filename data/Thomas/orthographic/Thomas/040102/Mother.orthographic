when you got it I was a little bit worried that it would get broken . 
not by you .

I don't think she knows what she wants . 
I think she wants to sleep in the chair . 
I bet she comes on my knee in a minute . 
yes [>] . 
realized I'm sitting down . 
but [>] &-um . 
I think part of the thing is she thinks ooh@q . 
you're playing in here and you'll probably disturb her . 
but then there are other times when I think she really likes the company . 
come on . 
if you're coming . 
here we go . 
come [<] on , Purdie . 
come on . 
that's a good girl . 
she's jumped up . 
hello . 
she got a watery eye „ hasn't she ? 
a little tear . 
think she's sad ? 
Thomas , don't do that [>] . 
well . 
she can (be)cause there's a plate of cat food through there . 
she doesn't . 
right . 
don't know what you're saying . 
pick that up please , Thomas . 
well [<] pick it up , please . 
what's [<] [/] (.) what's dusty ? 
what ? 
what ? 
the equipment ? 
ooh no . 
you don't wash electrical things . 
no . 
they're not broken . 
it was just &-um +/. [+ IN] 
no . 
it isn't . 
it's sometimes this one . 
it's absolutely fine now but sometimes the aerial is not used . 
and when it is the orange light flickers on and off . 
doesn't quite know what it wants to do . 
and we have problems [>] . 
well . 
yes . 
yeah . 
we've got a temperamental &-um whatever it's called . 
receiver and a temperamental Purdie xxx .[+ PI] 
and what else is temperamental ? 
yes . 
well . 
probably me as well , Thomas . 
definitely Daddy . 
yeah . 
is he bossy ? 
well . 
you can . 
I'm not . 
well . 
no . 
(be)cause Daddy won't be very pleased „ will he ? 
no . 
it's not nice . 
you know that barrier at the bottom . 
Thomas , underneath the wash . 
that's right . 
does it ? 
oh . 
<it &bl> [//] I see . 
if the motorcyclist moves it blocks off that „ does it ? 
it blocks off the ramp ? 
and could it go the other way as well ? 
well . 
I'm just thinking . 
could it [//] is there something that blocks off the bottom of the lift ? 
oh . 
I see . 
it's where the bottom of the lift comes down „ isn't it ? 
it looked like there should've been something there [<] but it's just the bottom of the lift „ <isn't it > [>] ? 
right . 
I wondered whether the barrier went over the other way and it &-um and blocked off the lift . 
but it doesn't „ does it ? 
yes . 
it's lovely . 
I like the colors as well . 
is your favorite color still blue ? 
is your favorite color still blue ? 
oh . 
what ? 
you like red as well „ do you ? 
so you like the top floor of the garage (be)cause that's blue . 
and you like the ramp and the lift . 
and the little service station place . 
and the columns . 
and who is it ? 
Purdie likes yellow „ doesn't she ? 
Purdie liked La la . 
so Purdie likes the first floor . 
and Daddy likes the ground floor . 
green . 
hm . 
but Daddy also likes the &-um the thing that works the lift . 
look . 
the top of the lift is green . 
well . 
it's green and yellow so Purdie's happy „ isn't it ? 
(be)cause the sticker's got blue on it . 
yes . 
there are . 
(be)cause the side of the lift is red . 
did they ? 
I think if you move the lift you'll find there is still stickers . 
some labels showing up and down . 
look . 
can you see the arrows ? 
oh . 
I see . 
it's worn away that „ hasn't it ? 
well . 
I washed it once , Thomas . 
put it in the bath and gave it a good wash (be)cause it was ever so dusty and I found I couldn't because it was too big to wash in the sink . 
it was the easiest way to do it . 
and perhaps the labels got wet . 
I don't think you're sposta wash them really „ are you ? 
going up the big ramp . 
yes . 
xxx . 
(be)cause it's that slippery . 
yeah . 
yeah . 
yes [<] . 
mhm . 
0 [=! chuckles] . 
goes down very easily „ doesn't it ? 
good job that barriers there otherwise it would've bumped your knee . 
on the way down „ wouldn't it ? 
&=laughs [>] . 
I'm going to do that again actually ? 
I couldn't hear you (be)cause you're giggling and the sound of the car coming down <the ramp > [>] . 
don't be silly . 
calm down . 
I know that Purdie's with you but she's sitting on my knee . 
she's on the what ? 
<on the colors> [<] . 
oh I see [>] . 
oh right . 
what's that label for ? 
the [/] the ramp . 
the service ramp ? 
I'm sure there's a proper name for those and I can't think what it is . 
rampers@c ? 
&=laughs . 
I don't think it's called a rampers@c . 
where are you going , Thomas ? 
no . 
no . 
leave it please . 
leave it . 
ooh . 
no . 
you just bumped her in the face , Thomas . 
well . 
just be careful . 
xxx [<] . 
come and say sorry@q please . 
no . 
she can't hear you from over there . 
come and say sorry to her face . 
no . 
come and look at her . 
she's deaf . 
she won't hear you how ever loud you shout . 
just look at her face . 
right . 
give her a little stroke then she'll know it's you . 
she bumped her face „ didn't you ? 
on the wood . 
no . 
you didn't protect her . 
you just bumped her head on the wooden chair . 
that's it . 
it's alright . 
she knows now you're sorry . 
doesn't she ? 
<can you see his> [//] just look at this bit of fur , Thomas . 
yeah . 
that's right . 
look at the color . 
it's black . 
and then sort of ginger . 
and then black . 
gingery blonde „ isn't it ? 
there we are . 
all forgiven . 
right . 
so are we going to get playing again with this ? 
the amount of cyclists coming into the garage . 
ooh . 
gosh . 
I bet he falls off going down the ramp , Thomas . 
think he'd be better just riding up and down in the lift . 
xxx . 
<he's not> [>] „ is he ? 
I'm not surprised he's fallen off . 
that was some sort of stunt that . 
you see sometimes people doing that „ don't you ? 
raising money for charity and breaking records . 
xxx . 
motorcyclists driving off <the top of> [>] buildings and trying to (..) zoom over things . 
Thomas . 
you're going to break some of these things . 
it's [<] (.) it's too noisy on the wooden floor as well . 
there's nothing wrong with a wooden floor but it's &-uh +... [+ IN] 
&=laughs . 
there's nothing wrong with you . 
no . 
that's what's wrong . 
it's just that at the moment we could do without lots banging and clattering . 
that's what's wrong . 
I can . 
that's right . 
no . 
don't . 
compared to what number is on the bicycle . 
number one . 
right . 
what you do , Thomas . 
his legs just fit over the bike like that . 
you press him on . 
then can you see how his hands look +//. [+ IN] 
oh dear . 
he's fallen off his bike . 
do you remember the firemen you've got ? 
those little play mobile firemen ? 
have little hands that grip things „ don't they ? 
you look at the motorcyclist . 
he's got the same sort of gripping hands . 
so once his legs are over . 
his hands grip on the handlebars on the motorbike . 
he's going meoow@o . 
doesn't he ? 
would be too fast for the motorway „ would it ? 
oh . 
right . 
that's really very fast „ isn't it ? 
mhm . 
okay . 
has it crashed into a bean bag ? 
pardon ? 
well [<] done . 
you've learnt how to do it . 
that's good . 
Thomas [>] . 
mind that red barrier . 
remember what I told you before . 
if you kneel on it . 
it'll snap . 
oh dear . 
I think I can guess what's happened . 
the taxi driver's run over the motorcyclist . 
is that right ? 
oh dear . 
broken the road ? 
how's he broken the road ? 
oh dear [/] dear [/] dear . 
give him a xxx .[+ PI] 
a hip ? 
oh . 
a hit . 
thought you said a hip . 
no , Thomas . 
don't do that . 
you're going to scratch it . 
the floor I mean . 
not the taxi . 
I don't think I'd like to get in a black cab [//] taxi that drove as fast as that , Thomas on the motorway . 
on two wheels ? 
on its side ? 
just imagine if you were going to the airport . 
all your suitcases would be on top of you . 
you'd be sitting on the car at one side and all your suitcases would've fallen on top on the other side . 
wouldn't be very happy „ would you ? 
with the taxi driver . 
what shall we do now what ? 
well . 
you're playing with your shop now ?

what 0do [*] you want , Madam ? 
what 0have [*] you got , Sir ? 
you've got what , Darling ? 
Missus ? 
Madam . 
well .

&-um garages usually have things like newspapers . 
and flowers and milk . 
do you ? 
and have all sorts of things for the car „ don't they ? 
like &-um air fresheners and cans of oil and deicer . 
and some of them have all sorts of things like a shop .

I'm glad about that then you won't be doing again „ will you ?

I suppose I hafta pay for the petrol though „ don't I ?

I bet she'd have a hat on and glasses .

little driving goggles . 
<and gloves > [<] . 
do you think she'd drive quickly or slowly ? 
slowly . 
well [<] . 
she could go and pick him up „ couldn't she ? 
she could set off from here . 
and drive into Didsbury and collect him . 
and they could go for a ride somewhere .
