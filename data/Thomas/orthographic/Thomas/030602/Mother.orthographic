well shall we do something ? 
shall we build you [//] your space rocket , Thomas ? 
you've got this „ haven't we ? 
we can look at as well . 
I'll go and get your little Buzz_Lightyear and then you can tell me all about it . 
I don't know a lot about Buzz_Lightyear , Thomas . 
do you wanna tell me about him ? 
Buzz_Lightyear . 
I think that came with (..) a Macdonalds a while ago „ didn't he ? 
no . 
it doesn't &shh [//] fit in the &shh [//] spaceship „ does it ? 
are you going to tell me about Buzz_Lightyear [>1] , Thomas [>2] ? 
oh please . 
because I don't know much about him <or Toy_Story> [>] . 
no [<] . 
that [//] don't (.) put him in there . 
because that's going to break that , Thomas . 
and that's really nice „ isn't it ? 
that's your space rocket . 
did you make that <at nursery> [>] ? 
oh_gosh that is fast . 
did you make that at nursery ? 
no [<] . 
you're breaking it , Thomas . 
I don't want you to do that with it please . 
so who is Buzz_Lightyear , Thomas ? 
is he a toy ? 
no . 
but in [//] there's a video called Toy_Story that you've watched . 
are you going to tell me about him ? 
is that his helmet [//] space helmet ? 
we've got a space (..) ship book here . 
it says a trip into space . 
create your own pictures with reusable stickers . 
right . 
so these are all stickers . 
I think Bethany gave you that for your birthday „ <didn't she> [>] ? 
you wanna look at something ? 
it says the spaceship <is ready for lift off> [>] . 
yes . 
the spaceship is ready for lift off . [+ R] 
suddenly there is a deafening noise and an enormous flame . [+ R] 
and our space trip begins . [+ R] 
0 [=! gasps] . 
we have some satellites on board this spaceship . [+ R] 
which we hafta launch into space at just the right moment . [+ R] 
next we hafta visit some of the planets to collect rock samples . [+ R] 
finally we return to earth amazed by all we have seen . [+ R] 
what a great adventure . [+ R]

little panda was sitting in his room lost in his computer world . [+ R] 
three police cars screeched to halt . [+ R] 
blue lights flashing . [+ R] 
what do you think they were saying ? 
&=laughs . 
Mum opened the door and the police charged through to the back garden (.) over the wall and in through the window of number six . [+ R] 
the burglars heard them and ran out of the door of number six . [+ R] 
but more police cars were coming down the street . [+ R] 
so they ran into number five (.) little panda's house . [+ R] 
0 [=! gasps] . 
they burglars bounded up the stairs to the top room (.) little panda's room . [+ R] 
little panda was still lost in his computer world and didn't notice . [+ R]

little panda still didn't notice . [+ R] 
why did he not notice , Thomas ? 
you wish you were watching telly and nobody disturbed you ?

at last little panda came down . [+ R] 
you see panda hadn't even noticed . 
while you've been watching your boring program +//. [+ N] [+ R] 
oh sorry .

while you've been watching your boring program I've had such an exciting game on my computer . [+ R] 
cops and robbers he said . [+ R] 
“look [/] look” cried baby panda . [+ R] 
wow@q said little panda “real cops and robbers” . [+ R] 
“yes (.) real cops and robbers” echoed little baby panda . [+ R] 
look [/] look [>] .

baby panda's wearing a police helmet „ isn't he ? 
and [/] and his teddy bear's (.) wearing <a police helmet> [>] and panda's carrying +... [+ N]

they're called handcuffs .

did you want it again ?

you'd like another drink ? 
<no not> [<] now , darling . 
well that's funny because we thought that book was +//. [+ N]

I suppose it was in a way but it wasn't fighting fires „ was it ? 
so +//. [+ N] 
oops , darling , you alright ? 
you're sitting on the police helmet ? 
well that'll make you very high up „ won't it ? 
Mum sat down at last . [+ R] 
at last she could enjoy her tea and watch her favorite program . [+ R] 
baby panda was quiet and little panda was upstairs . [+ R] 
little panda was in another world . [+ R] 
he was in his room but in another world . [+ R] 
he was lost in the make believe world of his computer . [+ R] 
in the real world it was getting dark . [+ R] 
“look [/] look” said baby panda and pointed into the darkness . [+ R] 
two burglars were climbing the neighbors windows . [+ R] 
Mum called the police station . [+ R] 
hello I'm calling for five church street . [+ R] 
burglars are breaking into there . [+ R] 
come quickly . [+ R] 
just sit still , darling . 
baby panda kept watch at the window while Mum went to the front door to wait for the police . [+ R] 
little panda was still in his room lost in this computer world . [+ R] 
three police cars screeched to a halt (.) blue lights flashing . [+ R] 
Mum opened the door and the police charged through to the back garden (.) over the wall and in through the window of number six . [+ R] 
the burglars heard them and ran out of the front door of number six . [+ R] 
but more police cars were coming down the street so they ran into number five (.) little panda's house . [+ R] 
the burglars bounded up the stairs to the top room (.) little panda's room . [+ R] 
little panda was still lost in his computer world . [+ R] 
he didn't notice . [+ R] 
the police chased up the stairs after the burglars . [+ R] 
the burglars climbed out of the window onto the roof . [+ R] 
“call the fire brigade” called the police chief . [+ R] 
we'll soon get them down with long ladders . [+ R] 
the fire engines with long turntable ladders roared down the street . [+ R] 
ladders soared up to the roof and the police and fire fighters began climbing . [+ R] 
look at this . 
police first and then the fire fighters . 
oh stop it now , Thomas . 
you're going to fall and hurt yourself . 
as they clambered onto the front of the roof (.) the burglars leapt [: leaped] off the back into the branches of a tall tree in the garden . [+ R] 
“surround that tree” yelled the police chief . [+ R] 
the burglars climbed across into the next tree (.) and the next tree (.) and the next (.) all round the garden until they were back in the first tree . [+ R] 
then they climbed back into little panda's room . [+ R] 
0 [=! laugh] . 
but little panda didn't notice . [+ R] 
I think you'd notice if somebody went into your bedroom „ don't you , Thomas ? 
won't ? 
the burglars chased down the stairs by the fire fighters (.) crashed into the police coming up . [+ R] 
they all landed in a heap of arms and legs and handcuffs and helmets . [+ R] 
when the firefighters had packed up their ladders and the burglars were being led away by the police (.) Mum made a fresh cup of tea . [+ R] 
at last little panda came down the stairs . [+ R] 
while you've been watching your boring program I had such an exciting game on my computer . [+ R] 
“cops and robbers” he said . [+ R] 
“look [/] look” cried baby panda . [+ R] 
wow [!] said little panda . [+ R] 
real cops and robbers . [+ R] 
“yes real cops and robbers” echoed baby panda . [+ R] 
look [/] look . 
the handcuffs ? 
well handcuffs are sposta go on your wrist . 
one part of the handcuff goes on the policeman's wrist (.) and the other part goes on your wrist . 
that means you're chained up to the policeman . 
<and wherever> [<1] +... [+ N] 
and wherever you go the policeman goes . 
to be sure that you can't get away . 
and even in the police car you'd still be handcuffed „ wouldn't you ? 
yes . 
and xxx other handcuff . [+ I] 
what , darling ? 
you've got those two books that I was hiding ? 
I'm hiding two more now . 
look at these . 
what were they bringing with them ? 
a big box and a helmet ? 
I think you might wanna change your [/] your helmet for this book , Thomas . 
this is about fire fighters . 
are you happy with your police helmet ? 
or would you like your yellow one ? 
you're happy with that one ? 
I think you need the yellow helmet for this book . 
oh there's [*] big bangs outside . 
one of the men in this book is called Anthony . 
now you've got a friend called Antony which is a bit different from Anthony . 
but it's almost the same „ isn't it ? 
right . 
well we'll read this book . 
it's called firefighters . 
now this is a lady firefighter . 
this is like <lady Penny &-uh> [//] firefighter Penny_Morris „ isn't it ? 
one day Liz was checking the hoses to make sure they were screwed tightly to the fire engine . [+ R] 
Liz is always busy at the fire station even when there are no fire . [+ R] 
Dan was polishing the wheels on the fire engine and Anthony was upstairs in the kitchen looking for a snack . [+ R] 
look he (h)as opened the fridge door . 
what can he see ? 
he is always hungry . [+ R] 
suddenly a loud noise made him jump . [+ R] 
ring^ring@o [/] ring^ring@o . [+ R] 
it was the fire alarm . [+ R] 
Anthony slid down the pole . [+ R] 
thud@o (.) he landed hard . [+ R] 
but the thick rubber pad on the ground cushioned his feet . [+ R] 
ready for action ! [+ R] 
trousers are rolled over boots to save time . [+ R] 
this way firefighters can be dressed and in the fire engine in thirty seconds . [+ R] 
that's good „ isn't it ? 
<I think> [<] that's a jigsaw . 
<Liz jumped> [<] . 
xxx there [?] . [+ I] 
Liz jumped into her boots and pulled up her firepuff [//] fireproof trousers . [+ R] 
she checked her computer . [+ R] 
it showed a fire at seven Oak_Lane . [+ R] 
in the fire engine Liz grabbed the walkie+talkie . [+ R] 
Chief_Miller we're on our way . [+ R] 
she's talking into a walkie+talkie (.) look . 
that's [<] really clever „ isn't it ? 
putting trousers over boots to save time when you're getting dressed . 
because when you're getting dressed we put on your pants then your socks then your vest and <then we put trousers on and then your shoes> [>] . 
yeah . 
right said the fire chief . [+ R] 
he had gone ahead in a special fast car . [+ R] 
I'll meet you there . 
Liz started the engine . [+ R] 
as the firefighters jumped in she flipped on the sirens and lights and drove out of the fire station . [+ R] 
the truck rushed towards the fire . [+ R] 
it's a lady driver (.) the fire engine . 
all the cars and buss stopped and waited when they heard the siren . [+ R] 
the fire chief called Liz . [+ R] 
I'm at the scene of the fire (.) it's an old house that (h)as been empty for years . [+ R] 
but somehow +//. [+ N] 
&-uh sorry (.) someone saw a young boy playing in the garden this morning . [+ R] 
he might be inside the house . [+ R] 
tell Dan and Anthony to get their air tanks ready . 
okay Chief said Liz . [+ R] 
I can see the smoke from here . [+ R] 
we'll be there in two minutes . [+ R] 
oh she's going quickly now . 
0 [=! gasps] . 
goodness me . 
Liz turned the corner into Oak_Lane . [+ R] 
the fire was spreading quickly . [+ R] 
flames covered the top of the house . [+ R] 
there was no time to lose . [+ R] 
right there's a little bit there about the hoses . 
it says water comes out of a fire hose so fast it's strong enough to knock a person down . 
Liz attached a hose from the engine to the nearest water hydrant . [+ R] 
a fire engine can pump water from a street hydrant to feed it's hoses . [+ R] 
Liz and another fire fighter pointed a hose at the flames . [+ R] 
ready called Liz . [+ R] 
whoosh (.) they held on tightly as water shot out . [+ R] 
oh look (.) breathing equipment . 
fire gives off deadly smoke . [+ R] 
firefighters wear air tanks and breathing masks inside a burning building . [+ R] 
Anthony and Dan got ready to search the house . [+ R] 
they put on their air tank and face masks . [+ R] 
each tank holds forty minutes of air . [+ R] 
the boy's name is Luke . [+ R] 
well the boy +//. [+ N] 
do you remember earlier on when they said there was a fire at the house ? 
the [<] old house ? 
it says it was an old house that had been empty for a long time but someone saw a young boy playing in the garden this morning . 
and they think he might be in the house . 
and they found out that the boy's name is Luke . 
<the boy's> [<] . 
you have „ haven't you ? 
at Missus_Plattford's nursery . 
Louie . 
oh right . 
oh Mercy_Vale you've got one called Luke ? 
at Missus_Plattford's it's Louie „ isn't it ? 
that's [<] right . 
the boy's name is Luke the chief told them . [+ R] 
you haven't got much time . [+ R] 
right said Anthony . [+ R] 
he grabbed a hose let's put the wet stuff on the red stuff said Dan . [+ R] 
that's funny . 
let's put the wet stuff (.) that's the water (.) on the red stuff (.) that's the fire . 
can you remember that ? 
let's put the wet stuff on the red stuff ? 
Dan and Anthony ran to the back of the house . [+ R] 
the fire was not as bad there . [+ R] 
Dan felt the back door . [+ R] 
if it was hot flames could leap out . [+ R] 
“it's cold” said Dan . [+ R] 
so they stepped inside . [+ R] 
the thick black some was everywhere . [+ R] 
Anthony shone his torch around . [+ R] 
Luke [/] Luke [!] he called . [+ R] 
no one answered . [+ R] 
“I can hear fire upstairs” said Dan . [+ R] 
the fire had damaged the staircase . [+ R] 
it could fall down at anytime . [+ R] 
they climbed the steps very carefully . [+ R] 
yes . 
hello , Purdie . 
outside the stabilizers were set down on the ground . [+ R] 
the stabilizers are like legs . [+ R] 
they keep the truck steady as the ladder is raised . [+ R] 
have you seen those before ? 
the ladder went up like a telescope to the top of the house . [+ R] 
a hose ran up the side . [+ R] 
the firefighter on the ladder shot water down onto the fire . [+ R] 
the flames crackled and hissed . [+ R] 
they got smaller and then suddenly jumped even higher . [+ R] 
inside the house the fire raged . [+ R] 
it was hot enough to melt glass . [+ R] 
oh dear . 
so that the fireman (h)as gone up onto his ladders „ hasn't he ? 
to jet water through the roof . 
Dan sprayed water onto the flames . [+ R] 
the fire had made the hose weak . [+ R] 
“it could come down at any second” said Anthony . [+ R] 
we must find Luke . [+ R] 
boom@o ! [+ R] 
a beam crashed down near them . [+ R] 
but their helmets protected their heads . 
crash@o ! [+ R] 
quickly@q said Dan we're running out of time . [+ R] 
right you've got your hard hat here „ haven't you ? 
a hard hat [//] firefighter's helmets are made of hard plastic . [+ R] 
a hard brim helps to keep the sparks off their necks . [+ R] 
oh look at this one . 
they came to another door but it would not open . [+ R] 
Dan swung his axe at the door . [+ R] 
once (.) twice (.) three times . [+ R] 
“it's jammed” shouted Dan . [+ R] 
the roar of the fire was so loud they could hardly hear . [+ R] 
we'll hafta use the electric saw . [+ R] 
there's a little part there about the firefighter's axe . 
it says axes have been used by firefighter's since the earliest days of firefighting . 
oh look . 
the sharp cutter there . 
the electric saw runs on batterys . [+ R] 
it can cut right through a roof of a car like a can opener . [+ R] 
right . 
well they've tried the axe on the door and it's not working . 
so it says Anthony switched on the saw . [+ R] 
whirr@o . 
he cut a hole in the door . [+ R] 
<big enough to climb through> [<] . [+ R] 
well I think that's the fire chief . 
he wears a white helmet so that everybody else knows that he's the fire chief . 
he's the one in charge . 
look he's talking to [//] into his walkie+talkie . 
I think he's the one giving orders „ isn't it ? 
<so Dan (h)as> [<] +... [+ N] 
Dan (h)as cut a hole in the door big enough for him to climb through and he (h)as gone in and he's shouting Luke [/] Luke ! 
but the room was empty . [+ R] 
suddenly the chief +//. [+ N] [+ R] 
that's the man in the white helmet . 
+, called “get out now the roof is coming down” . [+ R] 
0 [=! gasps] . 
Dan and Anthony raced downstairs . [+ R] 
they got out just as the roof fell in . [+ R] 
“we didn't find Luke” yelled Dan . [+ R] 
“he's okay” said the chief . [+ R] 
we just found him up the road . [+ R] 
phew@q said Dan . [+ R] 
good news . [+ R] 
so all that time the firefighters were in that house looking for the little boy Luke and he wasn't even there „ was he ? 
but [<] he might have been so they hadta look . 
it took hours to put out all the flames . [+ R] 
Anthony sprayed water onto the parts still glowing red . [+ R] 
he was tired and dirty and very hungry . [+ R] 
because [//] do you remember at the start of the story it said Antony was always hungry „ didn't it ? 
sorry [<] Anthony . 
Liz wound the hoses back onto the fire engine . [+ R] 
at last she could rest . [+ R] 
she felt worn out . [+ R] 
back at the station Anthony sat down to eat “at last” he said . [+ R] 
suddenly a loud [/] loud noise made him jump . [+ R] 
“dinner will hafta wait” smiled Dan . [+ R] 
ring^ring^ring@o . 
guess what ? 
another fire . 
&=laughs . 
poor Anthony was ever so hungry and he (h)ad worked really hard „ hadn't he ? 
and he was looking forward to his meal . [+ R] 
and just as he sat down to have it the alarm went off again . [+ R] 
so they'd hafta rush and do it all again „ wouldn't they ? 
poor firemen . 
I bet it's like that some days „ don't you ? 
I bet they're really [/] really busy . 
don't move the cloth . 
what would you rather be ? 
a policeman or a fireman ? 
you'd like to be both „ would you ? 
I don't think you could be both . 
you might get mixed up . 
<going to a fire wearing> [>] +... [+ N] 
Purdie's cry [* 0ing] +//. [+ N] 
oh , Purdie , what's the matter ? 
is she crying ? 
pardon ? 
what's she saying ? 
I can't tell what you're saying . 
she wants to read the book with us ? 
she's not going to eat the book . 
no she's not . 
<no she's not> [<] . 
let's do clap a penny . 
clap a penny [/] clap a penny one two three . [+ R] 
clap a penny [/] clap a penny one two three . [+ R] 
&=laughs . 
oh you're beautiful „ aren't you ? 
you a nice boy ? 
no if you were a fireman and a policeman , Thomas , you'd be going to catch burglars and you'd have your yellow helmet on . 
and you'd see the burglars and you'd go whoosh and you'd spray them with water from your hose . 
and then (.) you'd be going to a fire and you'd get there and think oh [=! gasp] I haven't brought my hose I've brought my handcuffs . 
and my truncheon and whistle . 
that's not a lot of good for putting fires out „ is it ? 
what do you like best ? 
fire engines or police cars ? 
ice cream ? 
do you like +//. [+ N] 
you could be an ice cream seller with a ice cream van . 
that makes a nice noise as it goes through the streets . 
ice cream . 
oh yes . 
a little boy's eating an ice cream there . 
what song does our ice cream man play ? 
teddy bears pooey ? 
I think it's teddy bear's picnic „ isn't it ? 
<if you go down to the <woods today> [<]> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
<you're in for a big surprise> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
<but better go in disguise> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
<for every bear that ever there was> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
<will gather there simply because> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
no , Thomas , you're going to break that . 
<today's [<] the day that teddy bears have their picnic [>]> [=! singing] . [+ R] 
is that crane ? 
there's this nice jigsaw here , Thomas . 
it forms a nice caterpillar when it's made up . 
on one side it (h)as got numbers . 
and [<] on the other side it (h)as got letters . 
clever „ isn't it ? 
are you tired ? 
no . 
what's Purdie doing ? 
she's scratching her neck on the blocks „ isn't she ? 
are you going to talk to Purdie for a few minutes ? 
you asking Purdie if she'd like sweets ? 
I don't think she does actually , Thomas . 
she really doesn't like sweets . 
no . 
don't stand on that . 
it's going to break . 
can you find the number four ? 
and then we can do this „ can't we ? 
ah there's number four . 
what comes after four ? 
three ? 
no three comes before four „ doesn't it ? 
number five . 
oh there's number five . 
that's handy . 
and then what ? 
&=laughs number three ? 
I thought that was a number six and it was number nine . 
<well I> [>] +... [+ N] 
the fire one ? 
well you can have a look through it „ can't you ? 
fire on what ? 
you're just being silly now „ aren't you ? 
where's the number one ? 
have you pinched my number one ? 
I think you have „ haven't you ? 
it's a very long caterpillar . 
look at this . 
isn't it ? 
I thought you might have done . 
you're hiding the pieces of jigsaw in your yellow helmet ? 
that's cheeky „ isn't it ? 
Thomas_Henry ! 
you're cheeky giggling away there . 
do you think I wouldn't notice ? 
you are a burglar „ aren't you ? 
I think some of this +//. [+ N] 
ah I see (.) it's on the other side . 
if I had handcuffs now do you know what I would do ? 
I'd put them on you . 
and fasten them up for a very long time . 
<and then> [<] you wouldn't be able to pinch all my pieces of the jigsaw . 
you're cheeky [/] cheeky boy [>] . 
hm: [>] ? 
0 [=! gasps] . 
Purdie , do you know what your naughty brother's doing ? 
he's pinching the pieces of the jigsaw . 
what would you like to do <again again> [/] again ? 
0 [=! gasps] . 
it was your money box ? 
it looks to me like your police helmet with pieces of jigsaw in . 
I'm terribly sorry . 
I got muddled up . 
well what would you like me to do ? 
the number side or the letter side ? 
well I can't start because I think you've already pinched the a@l and the b@l . 
well you'd better pick it up because I can't make it if some of the pieces are missing „ can I ? 
sorry , love . 
thank you . 
oops . 
now we've lost some more „ haven't we ? 
we've lost the a@l and the c@l on the floor , Thomas . 
right . 
g@l h@l i@l j@l for j@l . 
that's &m [//] the letter of Mummy's [//] the first letter of Mummy's name .

I have reason to believe that you've pinched my jigsaw . 
have you ? 
0 [=! gasps] . 
right ! 
where's [*] those handcuffs ? 
handcuffs on (.) lock them . 
and throw away the key . 
into jail for you . 
I beg your pardon ? 
did you say smelly bottoms ? 
Thomas_Henry , since you've started nursery you're coming out with all sorts of rudey_dudey@d things . 
right for saying “smelly bottoms” I'm giving you an extra two years in jail . 
that means two Christmas (.) two birthdays you'll miss (.) for being cheeky boy . 
Thomas ! 
Thomas [/] Thomas , that will do . 
are you ? 
you're clearing xxx into the helmet „ are you ? [+ I] 
Thomas , stop saying that . 
not now . 
no . 
no . 
leave the box there . 
what have we got in here , Thomas ? 
come on . 
let's have a look at this . 
oh what's in this box over here ? 
what's in there ? 
do you know what those are ? 
they're lids from (..) Smarties „ are they ? 
would you like some Smarties ? 
<no I don't> [<] know what Purdie wants . 
Purdie (h)as just been fed and she's still making a lot of noise „ isn't she ? 
who's smacking bottoms ? 
<well if> [<] you're smacking my bottom you're not having any Smarties . 
no . 
I don't know . 
no . 
there's [<] nothing in there now . 
it's empty „ isn't it ? 
this has got something in it because this is rattling . 
I think it might be Smarties . 
it says Smarties on the box „ <doesn't it> [>] ? 
you can if you over there . 
<I think> [<] it's Smarties . 
yes . 
they're little chocolate sweeties „ <aren't they> [>] ? 
mind the books , Thomas . 
<well you get> [>] +... [+ N] 
pardon ? 
table and chair sweeties ? 
what do you mean ? 
well you usually get Smarties in tubes and when they come in tubes they have lids (.) like this . 
<but those Smarties are in a little box> [>] . 
oh look . 
and I've just got the lids . 
have you seen on top of the Smartie lids ? 
we've been saving these . 
they all have a different letter „ don't they ? 
can you see them ? 
well (..) I think it's just something they do on the top of the Smartie lids (.) so that you can play with the lids afterwards and spell [/] spell things „ can't you ? 
I don't know what we would spell with these letters . 
there are two shades of green (.) orange and red . 
they must not do any other colors . 
I 0have [*] seen you hiding some ! 
am I allowed a Smartie please ? 
could you give it to me in the lid of this one (.) a green a@l please . 
that's it . 
that (h)as got an a@l on it . 
and it's green . 
oh blue Smartie ! 
thank you so much . 
oh [=! laughs] . 
I put the lid in my mouth by mistake . 
<no because> [>] +... [+ N] 
no [<] . 
dark green a@l . 
light green b@l . 
<light green> [<] c@l . 
and an orange d@l . 
right . 
are you going to put Smarties in each of those ? 
a@l b@l c@l and d@l . 
look we can make a little wriggly snake . 
0 [=! gasps] . 
no don't you put the lid in . 
that was a mistake when Mummy did it , darling , because you might swallow it . 
<oh no> [<] . 
they've all fallen on the floor now . 
oh and an e@l . 
a@l b@l c@l d@l e@l f@l g@l h@l i@l +... [+ N] 
can't see a j@l . 
or a k@l or an l@l . 
oh there's an l@l . 
can't see any others . 
what are you doing ? 
you've gone very quiet . 
we've got a few of the same letters (.) look . 
we've got two g@l two f@l two d@l . 
lots_of n@l . 
Thomas , what's the matter ? 
oh look at that one ! 
it's an orange smartie that looks like it (h)as melted and then gone back together in a funny way „ doesn't it ? 
but if you'd like it you can have it (.) with pleasure . 
are you going to put it in the lid of that one ? 
it doesn't really fit „ does it ? 
it's such a funny shaped Smartie . 
they're my favorite (.) orange ones . 
well I think it's big enough for us to share „ isn't it ? 
that one . 
well shall I just have a bite ? 
mm . 
thank you very much . 
mm mm . 
how's that ? 
there are two more Smarties on the floor „ aren't they ? 
look at these . 
these are nice [>] +... [+ N] 
these are nice letters „ aren't they ? 
yes . 
these are letters of the alphabet made of wood and painted . 
and they've each got something on them . 
a picture . 
and I would imagine the picture perhaps (..) starts with the first letter of the alphabet that they're showing . 
I can't see a letter a@l though . 
can you ? 
I can see a b@l . 
because (..) what's there painted on the b@l ? 
b@l for butterfly . 
oh yes . 
there's the a@l . 
and do you know what it is ? 
it's a snake . 
we've had this before in books „ haven't we ? 
the snake is the adder . 
that's the a@l . 
b@l for butterfly . 
and what do you think the c@l will be ? 
I would imagine it's a pussy cat . 
ah so it is . 
look . 
who's this like ? 
it's like Purdie but it's a ginger cat . 
it might be like Ginger . 
no . 
I'm fine , Thomas . 
thank you very much . 
if you can eat it you eat it , darling . 
oh and d@l for +... [+ N] 
no . 
no it's a dog . 
let's see what the s@l has . 
the s@l is another snake (.) look . 
but you're quite right . 
spider and snail . 
that was clever „ wasn't it ? 
spider and snail . 
I think it's a snake . 
a@l b@l c@l d@l . 
I bet you e@l (i)s an elephant „ don't you ? 
and what about the f@l for fish ? 
can you see a <f@l f@l> [/] for fish ? 
there's a f@l fish . 
what about g@l ? 
g@l ? 
what do you think that would be , Thomas ? 
giraffe I think „ don't you ? 
and what about h@l ? 
for horse . 
that must be an igloo . 
what about j@l . 
oh sorry no i@l . 
i@l is the island „ isn't it ? 
I can't see j@l . 
Thomas , what are you hiding under the table ? 
no I bet you don't . 
ah j@l is the Jack_in_the_Box . 
l@l is the lion . 
oh we've missed k@l out . 
k@l is the king . 
l@l for the lion . 
<you cheeky little monkey> [<] ! 
I've only just noticed what you're doing . 
when I've gone back to the start of the alphabet we start at c@l . 
and a@l for adder and b@l for butterfly are missing . 
along with Thomas who is under the table . 
m@l is for monkey . 
we've just read a book with some monkeys in . 
n@l for notes [//] music notes . 
o@l for octopus . 
I'm watching you . 
p@l for parrot . 
there's [*] some Smarties that need picking up while you're under there . 
and q@l for queen . 
look we've got k@l for king and q@l for queen . 
r@l for rabbit . 
and s@l for snake . 
Purdie's watching . 
t@l (..) must be for temple . 
u@l is a unicorn . 
v@l is a violin . 
w@l is a whale . 
x@l a xylophone . 
y@l is for yellow [//] yellow pencil .

I'm going to go and have a Smartie . 
I can see a purple one that +//. [+ N] 
+, I shall pinch that and eat it .

I can see two brown ones (.) a yellow one and a blue one on the floor . 
I shall have those ones in a minute . 
I'm going to get the policeman's helmet . 
come and find you . 
what are you eating under the table ? 
how come you found a Smartie under there ? 
0 [=! gasps] . 
where (h)as the blue one gone that I saw a minute ago ? 
oh no it's still there . 
you want me to turn my head here and when the clock goes to the bottom (.) what ? 
0 [=! gasps] ! 
are you pinching ? 
well [<] if I close my eyes I can't tell when the clock goes to the top or the bottom „ can I ? 
will you shout ? 
I'll bet you'll shout when you've eaten all the Smarties and pinched a few more letters . 
is it ? 
oh well no more letters have gone missing . 
there are twenty six letters of the alphabet and I've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty . 
have you pinched six of my letters ? 
you've got an a@l (.) a b@l (.) a c@l (.) an f@l (.) n@l and an o@l . 
that's six letters missing . 
you must think you're Postman_Pat collecting letters . 
what's the matter , Purdie ? 
would you like something to eat , Poppet ? 
well I'm going to feed Purdie because Thomas is just being too quiet . 
he's up to no good . 
little boys who sit under the table and are very good +//. [+ N]

what do you think , Purdie ? 
yes Purdie agrees with me . 
Purdie thinks you're probably being a little bit naughty .

one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen ! 
I shall count them again in a minute . 
caught you ! 
caught you ! 
there you are , Purdie . 
I'll feed you . 
there are a lot of bangs outside . 
it's a month too early . 
this is ridiculous . 
it's a good job Purdie can't hear very well „ isn't it ? 
because they tell you you've got to keep pets in (.) bonfire night . 
and if they're going to start this early (.) people won't have kept their pets in because they're not expecting it „ are they ? 
it's quite cold as well today „ isn't it ? 
how many letters have I got left now ? 
two four six eight ten eleven . 
Thomas Lastname [<] , I'm arresting you for having all those letters of the alphabet .

you're cheeky .

<there's a> [<] [/] there's a brown one there that I can see .

goodness me . 
it's not as if they're very +//. [+ N]

it's a bit much .

where are the other sixteen ?

I think you're too busy eating Smarties as well „ aren't you ? 
you feel a bit sick ? 
good . 
yes good [>] . 
because [>] that will teach you . 
do you really feel a bit sick ? 
is that why you've gone quiet ? 
when you eat things do you feel sick , Thomas ? 
I think Purdie's <probably going to> [>] +... [+ N] 
no don't shout at Purdie . 
I think she's going to feel a bit sick in a minute because she (h)as eaten a very [/] very big tea „ hasn't she ? 
she (h)as eaten a really big meal . 
yes ? 
oh [<] don't touch that ! 
that's Daddy's keyboard .

you must not touch that at all . 
he'll [?] have a fit if he sees you touching that .
