now that's very [/] very hot water . 
so you mustn't touch it . 
it's straight [>] from the kettle .

can you see we're putting water in the saucepan . 
and then we've got a jug „ haven't we ? 
inside of the saucepan . 
and we're going to melt some chocolate . 
yes . 
very hot . 
because tomorrow it's Purdie's birthday . 
and we're going to make a cake for her „ aren't we ? 
and Mummy was going to put some chocolate pussy cats on top . 
so we've bought some chocolate and we're going to just break a few squares off . 
would you like to eat one ? 
I thought you might . 
there you are . 
what do you say ?

yes please . 
so I'm going to pop the chocolate into that jug . 
and we'll melt the chocolate . 
and then when it's all runny we'll pour it into some shapes . 
then it should come out as chocolate pussy cats to put on top of the cake . 
what do you think to that ? 
I don't think we need melt too much . 
I'll just do two more squares . 
there we are . 
we'll save the rest . 
would you like to eat another piece ? 
I thought you might . 
pardon ? 
oh I see you're holding that piece I've just given while you eat the one that's in your mouth .

now if I bring this nearer to you (.) you won't touch the pan „ will you ?

there we are . 
well let's just leave it a few more minutes to melt a little bit more . 
it'll soon start melting when the hot water reaches the jug „ won't it ? 
now this is what we're going to do , Thomas . 
when the chocolate (h)as melted we're going to pour it into some moulds .

is that what you're thinking off ? 
mind the pan .

you've got to mind the pan because it's full of boiling water „ isn't it ? 
the chocolate's melting quite nicely now , Thomas . 
I'll hafta leave it a little bit longer . 
that's a pussy cat tray „ isn't it ?

and then you can see when we pour it into the moulds . 
the fireman's making chocolates ?

that beautiful chocolate .

let's just get some chocolate there . 
can you see where the pussy cat's ears are ? 
at the top of his head ? 
oh I just wanna press the chocolate right into the corners .

we do the same on the other pussy cat . 
and then we'll see how much chocolate we've got left . 
and we can put some more on „ can't we ? 
and then we'll put these in the fridge to set . 
and then tomorrow we'll make the cake and we'll put some cream in the middle .

you useta do that when you were a baby . 
and you were tired . 
instead of saying go to sleep you useta lie down and go ah^phss@o [/] ah^phss@o . 
do you remember doing that ? 
no . 
I do . 
everybody go to sleep . 
because Granddad snores and Daddy snores . 
and you snore as well . 
but not quite as loudly as them . 
Mummy go to sleep . 
ah shall we have a cuddle ? 
can I lie on you and go to sleep ? 
come on . 
let's have a sleep together . 
ah . 
ah . 
ah . 
lie down that way ? 
do you not want me to lie with you ? 
lie down this way ? 
alright . 
will do . 
ah^phss@o . 
that's you snoring now . 
you do remember that noise . 
this is a little book called Snowman's squeaky song . 
shall we read it ? 
oh Purdie's here . 
hello , chicken . 
yes . 
there's dinner for her . 
oh no . 
there isn't . 
no . 
the cake's not ready . 
<no no> [/] no . 
we've just made the chocolate to go on top of the cake tomorrow „ haven't we ? 
don't [/] don't tell her about it . 
it (h)as got to be a surprise . 
once upon a winter's day when snow lay down around . [+ R] 
three elves made a magical snowman who sang with a squeaky sound . [+ R] 
just once . 
that's right . 
when Mummy says “squeaking or squeaky or squeaked or squeak” you can press it then . 
at first the snowman's squeaky song was just a touch off key . [+ R] 
but once he (h)ad coughed and cleared his throat he squeaked most tunefully . [+ R] 
the story spread around the town about the snowman's tune . [+ R] 
they marvelled at his clever squeak . [+ R] 
how he did it no one knew . [+ R] 
soon the snowman could be found each day of the week . [+ R] 
in the park where skaters danced . [+ R] 
where he would cheerfully (.) squeak at Christmas time . [+ R] 
on starry nights the snowman traveled round . [+ R] 
his squeaky voice so sweet and clear bringing joy to all he found . [+ R] 
and who do you suppose they choose to lead the Christmas_Parade ? [+ R] 
the snowman thrilled the festive crowd with his squeaky serenade . [+ R] 
on Christmas eve the snowman squeaked a Christmas song so sweet . [+ R] 
but all who heard it snuggled down to a cosy cheerful sleep . [+ R] 
can you see the little boy there asleep with his teddy bear in his arms ? 
oh there's another little boy asleep up there . 
even the bird's asleep in it's nest . 
look . 
on Christmas_Day our snowy friend sang just for Santa_Claus . [+ R] 
and Santa loved his squeak so much he clapped without a pause . [+ R] 
<no no> [/] no . 
one squeak when Mummy says “squeak or squeaky or squeaked” . 
they say the snowman sings his songs in snowy lands the whole year long . [+ R] 
a tree (h)as fallen down . 
yes . 
it's just a log „ isn't it ? 
it's a branch . 
and what's sitting on it ? 
a little mouse and +... [+ IN] 
a pussy cat ? 
no . 
that's a fox . 
and if you listen carefully you just might hear his squeaky song . [+ R] 
did you like that ? 
you want the Father_Christmas one ? 
this is called Santa's squeaky boots . 
so it's the same sort of thing , Thomas . 
when I say “squeak or squeaky or squeaked or squeaking” you can press it once . 
oh I've not said anything yet . 
Santa had some brand new boots the day of Christmas_Eve . [+ R] 
but when he walked they made a squeak that no one could believe . [+ R] 
once please . 
he wore them to his workshop where the elves were making toys . [+ R] 
each time he squeaked they all stopped work and cried “what is that noise” ? [+ R] 
when Santa walked out to his sleigh his boots squeaked in the snow . [+ R] 
the reindeers [: reindeer] [*] started giggling to hear him squeaking so . [+ R] 
then Santa waved goodbye at last and disappeared from sight . [+ R] 
when Santa stepped out on the roof his boots squeaked in the night . [+ R] 
slipping quietly down the chimney with the sack he creeped . [+ R] 
but when his two feet touched the floor his boots made such a squeak . [+ R] 
why are you biting your thumb ? 
does your mouth hurt ? 
those squeaky boots woke one small child . [+ R] 
who wandered out to see . [+ R] 
just what could make that squeaking sound . [+ R] 
so Santa hid behind a tree . [+ R] 
all through the night that squeak was heard . [+ R] 
on floors and roofs and stairs . [+ R] 
in fact his squeak brought out the mice . [+ R] 
by morning Santa's squeaky boots had squeaked the whole world round . [+ R] 
he even grew to like the squeak . [+ R] 
and smiled to hear the sound . [+ R] 
so if you're waiting up for him . [+ R] 
and wanna take a peep . [+ R] 
you're sure to hear him coming first . [+ R] 
you'll recognize that +... [+ IN] [+ R] 
that Christmas ? 
that squeak ! 
do you see the Christmas tree there ? 
hold the star ? 
there's a star on top „ isn't there ? 
Thomas , is it your mouth that's hurting ? 
or is it your thumb ? 
not teeth ? 
because you're biting a lot „ aren't you ? 
oh isn't it miserable and dark ? 
oh . 
what (h)as happened ? 
nothing (h)as happened . 
I think Purdie wants some food . 
shall I give her some food ? 
<no if> [//] we can't give her cake yet , Thomas . 
no . 
but listen . 
even when we bake the cake +/. [+ IN] 
Father_Christmas is coming to see Purdie ? 
and he'll have a present ? 
wow . 
that sounds exciting . 
very exciting . 
I think . 
do you think it's very exciting as well ? 
but , Thomas , when the cake's made I don't think Purdie's going to actually wanna eat the cake . 
we can eat the cake . 
and we can put candles on it for Purdie . 
but I don't think pussy cats really like cake . 
we'll give Purdie some chicken with some salmon . 
we'll give her something that she likes to eat . 
we'll have the cake . 
we can sing happy birthday to her . 
and we can put some candles on it and blow the candles out „ can't we ? 
what (h)as happened ? 
well it looks like the racing car (h)as got both it's doors open and it's bonnet open . 
is the fire engine coming and the police car ? 
are you a tired boy ? 
what (h)as happened ? 
you want the fire engine to mend it ? 
am I the fire engine ? 
okay . 
shall I mend it then ? 
I'll shut the doors . 
they're quite stiff actually . 
and put the bonnet down . 
there we are . 
it says number one . 
number one's mended . 
one door open it ? 
another door open it ? 
what do you mean the +//. [+ IN] 
oops . 
what do you mean the fireman do it now ? 
it's squeaking „ isn't it ? 
a little bit like Santa's boots . 
and the snowman's squeak song . 
can you hear the car squeaking ? 
why are you calling Purdie a fish ? 
a yellow fish now actually ? 
can you see the snowman (h)as got a hat on „ hasn't he ? 
a little bit like <top em> [//] the fat controller's top hat . 
and he's wearing a nice red and green stripy scarf „ isn't he ? 
is he waving ? 
no . 
I don't think the digger will fit in there , Thomas . 
that's the little shed that you put the xxx in . [+ PI] 
it's far too small for the digger . 
shall we try the digger in this box ? 
it's a little bit bigger . 
oh it <won't [: won't]> [//] still won't go properly „ will it ? 
it won't go in properly . 
let's try backwards . 
no . 
it still won't go in backwards . 
what funny noise ? 
it's the car . 
the car's hiding there „ is it ? 
stay there ? 
what , the car ? 
you'd like the car to stay in there ? 
you want the car to hide behind there ? 
right . 
you can't see it now „ can you ? 
because it's hiding . 
where (h)as the bus gone , Thomas ? 
where's the bus ? 
where has the bus gone ? 
where (h)as the bus gone ? 
when you were a lot younger that's all you useta say . 
where's the bus ? 
where's the bus ? 
do you remember ? 
you useta spend hours looking for the bus . 
you useta hide the bus under the stairs . 
and then say “where's the bus” ? 
and we'd all hafta look for it . 
and you would always know where it was . 
I think the bus is in that box . 
it's not in that box . 
because that box is empty . 
and it's not in this box because this box is empty . 
I think it's in +//. [+ IN] 
oh who's in the box with the bus ? 
yes . 
but who was in the box with the bus ? 
the digger man . 
that one's very hot „ is it ? 
the one that the digger man's in ? 
oh that's quite handy . 
because if he's having to sleep outside in December in an engine shed it's just as well it's very hot „ isn't it ? 
because he (h)as not got a nice warm bed or nice warm blankets to lie in „ has he ? 
is the digger driving round looking for it's driver ? 
it's riding around looking for the driver . 
you've put it in that box ? 
shall I get him out and sit him in the digger ? 
in a minute . 
where (h)as Thomas gone ? 
Thomas is hiding behind the box that Bertie_the_bus's in . 
I can't see his eyes and I can't see his nose . 
but I can see one ear . 
and I can see a cheeky smile . 
and some teeth . 
and a little chin . 
a little chin . 
I think Thomas is hiding there ! 
aren't you ? 
there he is ! 
my little treasure . 
there he is . 
my little treasure . 
ah . 
Bertie_the_bus where are you ? 
oh . 
he's lying on his side again , Thomas . 
is he tired ? 
do you think when buss go to sleep they lie on their side ? 
all day ? 
oh right . 
Saturday Sunday . 
every day . 
what [<] [/] what are the days of the week ? 
Bertie_the_bus would like a Smartie „ would he ? 
who else would like a Smartie ? 
the elephant ? 
<you mean> [<] the elephant on your jumper ? 
you'd like a jelly sweet rather than a &Smart +//. [+ IN] 
oh look there's one jelly sweet left . 
that's all there is . 
one jelly sweet . 
the green jelly sweet . 
would you like [>] +... [+ IN] 
it's yours .
