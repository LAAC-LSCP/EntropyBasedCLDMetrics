we were going down School_Lane „ weren't we ? 
near the school . 
we saw +//. [+ IN] 
I'm sure we saw two either the same day or very soon after one another . 
well people have just driven off and forgotten that they've got the back of their cars open and vans . 
very silly „ isn't it ? 
I think somebody did that the other day here because (..) there were all those papers lying in the road . 
and Uncle_Brian went outside and picked them up . 
and it was somebody's folder and I think they (h)ad left it on top of their car and driven away . 
all the papers blew about „ didn't they ? 
and ended in our trees . 
no . 
don't break the cup , Thomas , please . 
you won't be able to use it again if you do that . 
now . 
that's not nice . 
does it say Royal_Mail on it ? 
yes . 
the back ones don't seem to be going round very well „ do they ? 
I think we'll hafta take it to the garage for repair . 
or perhaps Daddy could just have a look at it . 
what do you think ? 
do you think Daddy will be able to fix it . 
mhm . 
that's right . 
they seem to be turning round „ don't they ? 
I don't really know what the problem is . 
I would imagine it (h)as been dropped „ has it ? 
right . 
you eat that piece for me please while I get something else . 
please , Thomas . 
that's it . 
good boy . 
that's a clever boy . 
<I'll give you a big kiss> [<] +... [+ IN] 
you need what , darling ? 
are you driving round and round ? 
I feel very cold , Thomas . 
I might hafta put some heating back on . 
there we are . 
it is . 
it's a jam tart . 
it's a very small red jam tart . 
we had some lemon curd ones . 
that's a nice red jam one „ isn't it ? 
does that taste good ? 
you like jam „ don't you ? 
I'm just going to put this <fridge &-eh> [//] cheese in the fridge . 
yes [>] . 
no . 
we put the cheese in the fridge . 
and then it will last longer „ won't it ? 
do you remember that program with Auntie_Mabel and the daffodils ? 
once they were picked and packed into bunches . 
and popped in boxes they went into a very [/] very cold storeroom „ didn't they ? 
Pippin says woof@o „ does he ? 
are you enjoying that jam tart ? 
nearly . 
well I was wondering why you said nearly . 
because you're either enjoying that or you're not . 
I just went upstairs , Thomas , to put some heating on because I felt very cold . 
you enjoyed that ? 
nearly ? 
I was going to have one of these little cakes . 
these little biscuits ? 
well we've got quite a lot of things in for your party „ haven't we ? 
we've not had those for a long time „ have we ? 
those little biscuits with the icing on top . 
we've got (.) let me think what we're doing for the party . 
we're going to do some sandwiches . 
tuna sandwiches . 
and egg sandwiches . 
and cheese sandwiches . 
and we've got sausages on sticks . 
and we're going to cut up some cheese into cubes . 
and put cheese and perhaps grapes and cheese and apple on sticks . 
cheese and custard ? 
you're talking a lot about custard today . 
we've not had custard for a long time . 
&-um (.) and then we've got . 
we've got lots_of bread . 
different sorts of bread . 
and we've got mini garlic breads . 
only about that size . 
about the size of this jam tart you're eating . 
and lots and lots_of garlic bread . 
and we've got two different sorts of pizzas . 
and then we've got all sorts of dips . 
we're going to have hummus . 
and I think it's garlic and herb and +//. [+ IN] 
oh I can't remember . 
onion ? 
I can't remember . 
all sorts of different dips anyway . 
because we've got to remember Daddy's going to be at the party and Daddy's on a diet . 
<so that> [<] hummus that Mummy had at lunchtime today Daddy can have „ can't he ? 
we'll get some more . 
&-um +... [+ IN] 
and then we've got Pringles and Wotsits and Quavers and Hula_Hoops and crisps . 
and we've got celery . 
and then we're going to do a plate with chopped up banana . 
and apples . 
and strawberries and grapes . 
and we've got these little biscuits with the icing on . 
we've got jam tarts . 
some lemon curd tarts . 
and I'm going to get a big plate +//. [+ IN] 
oh two big plates . 
one big plate (.) we'll have on it (.) a nice gateau . 
mhm . 
the postman was spinning round . 
and then we're going to have another platter and it'll just be full of little buns and little cakes and chocolate finger biscuits . 
soony^boony@c chocolate fingers . 
I've discovered that soony^boony@c is something +//. [+ IN] 
is it Milo or Fizz says ? 
Milo ? 
yes . 
watching Tweenies the other day Milo said soony^boony@c . 
we didn't know what soony_boony@wp meant before „ did we ? 
and (..) chocolate finger biscuits and those little chocolate tea cakes . 
and we've got ginger biscuits . 
homemade ginger biscuits . 
we'll have +/. [+ IN] 
+, other homemade biscuits . 
&-um not quite whether we'll do jelly and ice cream yet , Thomas , because everything else we've got people can pick up their fingers and eat . 
if we get jelly people are going to hafta have bowls and spoons . 
&-um (.) I think we might do ice cream in cones . 
that could be easier . 
the only trouble is we've got a lot of very young people coming „ haven't we ? 
we'll think about <jelly ice cream> [//] jelly and ice cream . 
but we've got lots_of sweet things . 
we've got cakes [>] . 
oh wibble_wobble@o . 
you're thinking of jelly on the plate „ aren't you ? 
well that's something else you did with Julian „ wasn't it ? 
<jelly on the plate> [/] jelly on the plate . [+ R] 
wibble_wobble@o [/] <wibble_wobble@o> [>] . [+ R]

and what did you hafta do ? 
you hadta <wibble_wobble@o wibble_wobble@o> [/] wibble_wobble@o „ didn't you ? 
with your legs and your arms and your head . 
and then +/. [+ IN] 
that's right . 
the last verse he said “<jelly on the plate> [/] jelly on the plate” . 
wibble_wobble@o [/] wibble_wobble@o . [+ R] 
jelly on the floor . [+ R] 
and you all hadta fall over . 
and his voice got really wibbley_wobbley@f towards the end „ didn't he ? 
he kept saying <jelly on the plate> [=! shaky voice] . 
he could hardly speak his mouth was wibbley@wp wobbling that much . 
and then we're going to have birthday cake . 
pardon ? 
you're going to hide under the table when it comes to the birthday cake ? 
oh . 
fair enough . 
that's up to you . 
how many candles on your birthday cake ? 
lots ? 
well how about three ? 
one two +... [+ IN]

just think the next time you do a tape after today you won't be two anymore . 
you'll be three . 
ah . 
no .

you'll [<] be three . 
my little baby's growing up „ aren't you ?

hm: . 
I think Uncle_Brian must be doing some jobs next door . 
you can hear him hammering . 
wonder what he's doing . 
well , Thomas , I remember you being two . 
and you started telling us that you were three +//. [+ IN] 
was it three and five months ? 
and then you said three and six months . 
sorry . 
not three and five months . 
two and five months . 
that would be when we were (.) in Spain „ wasn't it ? 
let me think . 
April (.) May (.) June (.) July (.) August (.) September . 
it was . 
yes . 
three and five months . 
that's right . 
three and five months when we went to Spain . 
but when we were in Spain you became +//. [+ IN] 
I keep saying three . 
you became two and six months „ didn't you ? 
not three . 
two and six months . 
what about the post lorry ? 
the post lorry's going up in the sky ? 
mhm . 
you're lifting it up and down . 
and then when it got to three and six +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
two and six months you kept saying you were two and a half „ didn't you ? 
if anybody asked you how you were you said “two and a half” . 
even when you were (.) say two and eight months you were still saying two and a half . 
you were +/. [+ IN] 
silly me ? 
silly me . 
you were two and a half at Christmas „ weren't you ? 
in December .

what am I talking about . 
you were two and eight months in December . 
nine months in January . 
ten months in February .

and three on Monday the third of +... [+ IN] 
Saturday ? 
Monday the third of April . 
you're enjoying those „ aren't you ? 
another packet full . 
yes . 
well that packet will hafta remain full . 
what about this ? 
are you going to finish this ? 
did you like that ? 
I'd like a taste . 
yes please . 
mhm . 
we're back to what we do with our senses „ aren't we ? 
tongues are for tasting . 
fingers are for feeling . 
ears are for +... [+ IN] 
what are ears for ? 
hearing . 
listening to things . 
and what do you do with your eyes ? 
you not know ? 
you look at things . 
you smell with your nose and you taste with your mouth . 
lots_of things . 
what would you like , darling ? 
it's empty . 
look [<] what's on the packet ? 
it's like a little bear „ isn't it ? 
no . 
you can't have anymore now . 
oh dear , Thomas . 
bless you . 
bless you in there ? 
you sneezed into the empty packet „ did you ? 
would you like a bite of this ? 
to taste this ? 
hm: [=! laughs] . 
that's not nice . 
tasting things and saying “oh yuck” . 
who says “oh yuck” ? 
no . 
Mummy doesn't say yuck . 
mhm . 
I know you say it . 
but who have you heard say ? 
no . 
it isn't something Mummy would say , Thomas . 
do they say it on the Tweenies ? 
what have they been eating on the Tweenies that they didn't like ? 
did they not like pasta ? 
you like pasta „ don't you ? 
it's your favorite . 
what else do you like eating ? 
you don't know ? 
watch [/] watch your sleeve on that , love . 
you've gone very tired now [>] . 
<no no> [/] no . 
no . 
because you've had cheese . 
you've had beefburger . 
you've had rice . 
you've had a jam tart . 
and you've had a little packet of biscuits . 
and you've been a good boy eating all that . 
but you didn't finish your rice , Thomas . 
did you ? 
no . 
no never mind . 
but you're not having sweets to finish off with . 
would you like an apple ? 
yes ? 
shall I peel you an apple ? 
mhm . 
somebody's not knocking on the door . 
somebody's kicking the chair with their feet . 
now I'm just about to get very cross . 
Thomas , no ! 
would you like an apple , darling ? 
that's a good boy saying yes please „ isn't it ? 
Mummy's very proud of you for saying that . 
<no no> [/] no . 
are you saying to the post lorry “you shut (.) you need my teeth to bite” ? 
are you going to open the back of the post lorry with your teeth because the door's shut ? 
you'll [<] end up breaking those beautiful teeth . 
you think how painful it was for them to come through . 
you wanna look after them ? 
you'll be able to brush them now with your new singing toothbrush . 
and we went to the dentist „ didn't we ? 
not many weeks ago . 
that was after Charlotte's birthday party . 
do you remember ? 
we went to Charlotte's birthday (.) and then +//. [+ IN] 
oh we had such a busy time . 
we went to Charlotte's party . 
we then went to the Spa shop . 
we bought some daffodils for Grandma . 
I can't think what else we bought . 
oh it was milk . 
I think we wanted milk . 
and then we dashed home . 
Daddy drove us into Didsbury and we went to see the dentist . 
and then that night we all went over to see Granddad „ didn't we ? 
Grandma and Granddad . 
that was a very [/] very busy day . 
is that apple nice ? 
good . 
that'll keep your teeth nice as well . 
if you crunch on an apple „ won't it ? 
the dentist likes it when you tell him you eat a lot of apples . 
and you [/] you eat a lot of fruit „ don't you ? 
oh that made a noise . 
listen at this (.) taking the label off the box . 
oh ! 
a Jack_in_the_Box ? 
yes . 
it could be „ couldn't it ? 
definitely very loud when we did that . 
I think I had better finish my coffee before it gets cold . 
must have been made nearly an hour now . 
got a big bruise on my foot , Thomas . 
have you been jumping on me ? 
have you ? 
hm: . 
I thought as much . 
poor Mummy . 
the post lorry door ? 
oh yes . 
oh [//] the back of the door fell off „ didn't it ? 
pardon ? 
you pulled it with your teeth „ did you ? 
and then it fell off onto the floor ? 
never mind . 
you thought you had broken it „ didn't you ? 
and you got quite upset . 
and Mummy said “don't worry (.) I'll fix it” . 
and I did „ didn't it ? 
look . 
I've just noticed Daddy's shirt's on the floor . 
must have fallen down from the drying rack . 
better hang it up again otherwise it won't get dry „ will it ? 
now I think the thing is though (.) those lorrys , Thomas , it's very nice to look at and it's alright as long as you're careful with it . 
but if you start dropping it bits are going to fall off „ aren't they ? 
it's a little bit like that blue mini car that Granddad bought you a long time ago . 
you dropped that and the doors fell off „ didn't they ? 
but with the post lorry I think the doors are meant to come off sometimes . 
but they're very easy to put them back .
