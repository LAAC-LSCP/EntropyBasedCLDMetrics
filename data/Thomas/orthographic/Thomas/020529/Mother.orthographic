they should have green and orange lights but (.) you've got to keep checking . 
good . 
they're both working now „ are they ? 
oh it's working now . 
no . 
don't do it again . 
I don't want it to smash . 
we've got to take the tape back with us „ haven't we ? 
oh dear dear . 
I'll put it back together and then we'll put it on top of the television . 
yes . 
you finish your orange juice . 
no . 
it's in the green beaker . 
and did you go for a walk with Grandad this morning ? 
where did you go ? 
to look at the lorrys . 
and were there any ? 
one two three seven eight . 
there's some building work going on near by „ isn't there ? 
it's not at the hotel but from here we can see . 
and what sort of things are there ? 
there are some mixers „ are there ? 
right . 
you didn't see them this morning but there've been two mixers and some diggers . 
and a crane . 
Thomas , be careful . 
let's just look at the lid on the juice . 
watch the lid doesn't come off . 
Daddy (h)as lost his glasses . 
let's go and help him look for them . 
is it your sunglasses , Daddy ? 
Daddy (h)as lost his sunglasses . 
uhoh .

it's going to break . 
the lid come off . 
yes .

leave it there . 
that's right . 
are you going to play with your trains now ? 
is there a big bus coming ? 
that's right . 
yes . 
we found the bus „ didn't we ? 
before we came away . 
it must be days the bus had been behind our television „ hadn't it ? 
at home . 
Daddy moved the television and found it before we came away . 
so what have you brought with you ? 
your bus . 
Lego train and horse . 
and your wooden train set with a bridge . 
going in there . 
do you know what all these are ? 
trees . 
they're birthday cards „ aren't they ? 
it was Daddy's birthday yesterday . 
sing it all . 
do you wanna sing it with Mummy ? 
right . 
Daddy's going out now . 
little while . 
has the bus gone ? 
I think you've hidden it inside one of Daddy's birthday cards „ haven't you ? 
going backwards . 
oh I can see a fire engine through the window , Thomas . 
if I hold you up quickly +/. [+ IN] 
you probably can't see it because it's going all the way round that road . 
can you see ? 
right at the bottom . 
do you know what this is ? 
it's yellow . 
it's a picture of a crown . 
and they've stuck it on a patio door . 
<so that> [<] [/] so that you can tell that there's glass there . 
because if there was nothing there it would be so clear that you might walk straight through it but that tells you that there's something there . 
while you're playing with your bus Mummy's just going to tidy the beds . 
I think the cleaning lady will be coming in in a few minutes . 
is this Daddy's bed ? 
that one xxx . [+ PI] 
which one's Daddy's bed and which one's Mummy's bed ?

we turned two armchairs round so that the backs of the chairs were against the side of the bed and you slept +/. [+ IN] 
oh has the bus fallen over ?

there's only one fire engine . 
it wasn't in a hurry though „ was it ?

but we can't really go outside . 
just a second . 
yes . 
it's a man . 
what's he doing ? 
is he going to do some repairs ? 
yes . 
right . 
we'll leave him to get on with his job . 
yes . 
oh we've had problems with the door on the bathroom „ haven't we ? 
when Daddy shut the door this morning we couldn't open it . 
it was stuck and then we thought we (h)ad mended it . 
then Mummy went in and it got stuck again . 
it was lucky Daddy was on the outside . 
so the gentleman (h)as come to have a look at the door . 
but also it looks as if he might do the repair the chain on the plug which we didn't ask for but it's nice if he's doing it „ isn't it ?

well I don't think there are any more fire engines . 
there was one fire engine . 
yes . 
yes . 
that's the man . 
he (h)as gone now „ hasn't he ? 
I suppose we should have spoken in Spanish to him , Thomas . 
instead of saying good bye . 
should we have said adios@s:spa ? 
are you going to inspect what he (h)as done ? 
has he mended it ? 
mended it . 
oh look . 
wow .

don't tell Daddy but we've ordered a birthday cake to come into the dining room tonight . 
it was actually Daddy's birthday yesterday but by the time I asked them to make a cake it was too late .

at half past seven this morning there was a man cleaning out the swimming pool and there were some pussy cats at the side of the pool . 
and yesterday morning we saw one drinking from it „ didn't we ? 
we've seen a black and white cat like Felix and a tabby cat like Purdie . 
but she wasn't fluffy like Purdie . 
where's Purdie at the moment ? 
she's not with us „ is she ? 
is Purdie staying in a hotel ? 
a special hotel for pussy cats . 
I think Daddy (h)as gone downstairs to read his newspaper „ hasn't he ? 
I don't know where Grandma and Grandad are .

we got in the lift and pressed number two and we ended up at number four and we didn't notice . 
and we got out of the lift and walked down the corridor . 
tried to put our key in the door and then we realized that the door said four one two instead of three one two . 
so we hadta get back in the lift and we pressed number two and instead of stopping a number two we ended up in the basement . 
pressed number two and we ended back at number four by which time Mummy couldn't walk for laughing „ could she ?
