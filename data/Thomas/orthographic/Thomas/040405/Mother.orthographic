Thomas , did the notes come out of this till ? 
with the toy money ? 
did they come out of the other till ? 
have you had that out today ? 
now where would you like me to put them back ? 
no . 
we can't leave them on the settee . 
because it's going to get lost . 
if the coins go down the back you'll never see them again . 
because I can't get them back . 
if they go into the frame of the sofa . 
that's it . 
it's gone forever . 
that's where I think half of your toys go . 
the small toys . 
things like bits of Lego . 
I don't put things on the settee for that reason . 
or the chairs . 
well it's springs and things . 
you've got the frame of the chair .

it could do with caterpillar wheels .

you didn't . 
it was a good guess . 
but the thing about the milk and the cream . 
I thought you must know . 
because even though we've made cakes and buns . 
you still always ask me what the ingredients go in it . 
so if you've suddenly come out with . 
the right ingredients for fudge . 
I think somebody's told you . 
you thought „ did you ? 
yeah . 
then I think you put it into a big tray „ don't you ? 
I don't think you cook it actually . 
I think once you've boiled it up in the pan . 
do you ?

you're playing with a [/] yellow bath sponge now „ aren't you ?

well the acid attacks the enamel . 
then you get a little hole in your tooth .

well (.) I'm not saying you'll never have it but . 
when you do something like drink juice just before going to bed .

don't you ? 
oh you can do . 
yeah . 
well no . 
I needta actually be there , Thomas .

I don't think you'd need stitches .
