what's that ? 
a song ?

xxx . 
wellies and swimming bags and what about your boat . 
and lots_of fish . 
oh tell Dimitra about your fish . 
two Aunty_Franks . 
at the weekend . 
Thomas was at his Grandparents and Uncle_David and Aunty_Sharon keep tropical fish in a big tank „ don't they ? 
and they suggested that they took Thomas along to the shop and that they would buy a fish for him . 
so that when he came to visit he had his own fish in their tank . 
but you actually ended up with two fish „ didn't you ? 
they bought two . 
one was a boy . 
one was a girl . 
and for some reason Thomas has called them both Aunty_Frank . 
<and we don't> [<] know why „ do we ? 
are you going to describe them to Dimitra ? 
tell her what they're like . 
but are they both red ? 
and what about their tails ? 
the tails are going flap [/] flap [/] flap . 
but one has the bigger than the other „ doesn't it ? 
he's looking at the wall . 
there might be some fish actually in that water „ mightn't there ? 
but Thomas , what about the fish ? 
is one a Daddy fish and one a Mummy fish ? 
and which is which ? 
all day long .

what do you mean like hopscotchs@c ? 
fireworks . 
oh Thomas . 
would you like me to get them for you ? 
I'll get the others . 
we've actually got quite a lot because my friend and York [>] gave us a lot of wooden jigsaws . 
we've got some more upstairs . 
when we went to visit . 
because her little boy and girl are now too old to play with these so she thought Thomas might want them . 
now just remember all this must be put away . 
you're not getting anymore out until they [//] it's all picked up . 
lots_of fireworks . 
we were doing jigsaws at the Beehive yesterday afternoon . 
because we went and it was raining so we hadta stay inside at the play centre „ didn't we ?

and all these are mine . 
why did you think they were fireworks , Thomas ? 
he's closing the gate . 
look . 
on the canal . 
look at that . 
I think that's called a lock „ isn't it ? 
I think it is . 
I'm not sure . 
yes . 
it's like a tunnel „ isn't it ? 
do you think there are a lot of fishes ? 
no , Thomas . 
don't bang .
