would you like to get Mummy a chair ? 
and I'll come sit with you . 
I'll get my own chair „ shall I ? 
you're building a big tower <with your> [>] alphabet box ? 
you're going to build a big house ? 
you're building a big house for Mummy ? 
that's nice . 
open the main book ? 
well this is in the shape of a bus . 
or perhaps it's a train . 
I think it might be a train . 
<what do you> [<] [/] what do you think ? 
a train or a bus ? 
it might be . 
it says alphabet express . 
twenty six fun a@l to z@l board books . 
and look (.) there's a train +//. [+ IN] 
well a train driver . 
I'm not sure if it's a train driver or a bus driver . 
and it says it's going from a@l to z@l . 
and who can you see ? 
what passengers are there on the bus ? 
now look at this side . 
who's this ? 
a giraffe ? 
sheep [>] . 
a sheep and a lion . 
and then on the other side we've got +/. [+ IN] 
an elephant and a crocodile . 
and who are they ? 
a bunny rabbit . 
yes . 
right . 
we'll open it up . 
get all the bricks ? 
well I think they're books rather than bricks . 
right . 
we'll leave that there . 
we don't wanna spoil the box „ do we ? 
and look it comes with it's own little library shelf . 
that's nice . 
this was a present from Grandma and Granddad at Christmas . 
did you know that ? 
no . 
Grandma and Granddad Lastname . 
it's a brick „ is it ? 
well I was just looking . 
because we haven't looked at these books properly . 
they're all little books apart from this one . 
which is +/. [+ IN] 
the letter x@l . 
no , Thomas . 
now pick that up . 
what have I just said about keeping the box nice ? 
because it's a nice little library shelf „ isn't it ? 
it's not nice because you nearly fell off your chair ? 
thank you , Thomas . 
look all the others are books . 
but x@l . 
there aren't many words beginning with the letter x@l . 
and look . 
it's not a book like the rest . 
open it up . 
and [<] it's an x-ray of somebody's arm . 
if you hafta go to the hospital (.) if you have a fall and you go to the hospital (.) they'll wanna see if any bones are broken . 
and they take a picture . 
a little bit like using a camera . 
but they can see inside . 
they can see through your jumper and through your arm into your bone . 
and it would look like that . 
that's what the inside of your arm looks like . 
and it's called an x-ray . 
xxx [<] . 
and look on the other side there's a picture of a xylophone . 
have you used a xylophone ? 
right . 
you're using the letter x@l as the roof of the house „ are you ? 
do you know what the letter x@l looks like ? 
it looks like lots_of kiss that you put on the bottom of birthday cards „ doesn't it ? 
<you know> [<] we sign birthday cards we put <kiss kiss> [/] kiss on the bottom ? 
we put lots_of cross „ haven't we ? 
oh . 
right . 
you must be very gentle with them . 
because they're books , Thomas . 
they're not bricks . 
if you wanna do some building +/. [+ IN] 
well shall we build them +/. [+ IN] 
shall we find the letter a@l ? 
the book that begins with a@l ? 
somebody's building a big tower ? 
well I'm going to build a big tower but I'm going to start with this book . 
this is a@l . 
thank you . 
Bob_the_Builder has given Mummy two bricks „ has he ? 
well please may I have the a@l back ? 
and then I'd like the b@l brick . 
and then I'd like the +... [+ IN] 
c@l . 
three . 
yes . 
you're quite right . 
it is the third book . 
one two three . 
a@l b@l c@l . 
and look . 
if you look at the spines of the book (.) when we put them together +/. [+ IN] 
it forms a picture of little people „ doesn't it ? 
the [<] a@l book is half a rabbit . 
if you put the b@l next to it you've got the full rabbit . 
the b@l book has half a person on . 
put the c@l with it (.) we've got a full person . 
and can you see these across the top , Thomas ? 
letters ? 
a@l [<] b@l c@l in capitals ? 
and these are lower case letters abc@k . 
on [<] the bottom . 
a@l b@l c@l . 
what [<] [/] what goes after a@l b@l c@l ? 
three ? 
a@l b@l c@l +... [+ IN] 
d@l [<] . 
l@l j@l f@l ? 
a@l b@l c@l . 
no . 
I don't want them to fall over , Thomas . 
because they're going to break „ aren't they ? 
I don't want you smashing them . 
no . 
if the tower falls over the books are going to get damaged „ aren't they ? 
and today you said you wanted to look at the books . 
what can we see in the one that begins with a@l ? 
you're going to give me one in a minute . 
I think we'd be better using your building bricks to build houses . 
there you've got lots_of building bricks „ haven't you ? 
shall we get some of it out ? 
I'm just looking outside . 
some men are getting something out of a van . 
would you like to have a look ? 
can you see ? 
near Sue's house ? 
what is it they've got ? 
I <don't> [>] +... [+ IN] 
what have they got ? 
the big van is taking it away ? 
<it looks> [<] like a big fridge „ doesn't it ? 
now I think they've just unloaded from the van . 
I think they're taking it +//. [+ IN] 
oh it is . 
it's a big fridge . 
oh look at that . 
it must be heavy . 
perhaps it's a new fridge freezer . 
well they've bought something new „ haven't they ? 
oh look . 
there's little boy with them . 
I don't think he's helping very much „ do you ? 
no . 
I think not . 
you saying it's very cold ? 
you wish you had a police ? 
you're collecting your new game „ are you ? 
well I tell you what . 
shall we build them in here ? 
this [<] would make a nice tower . 
we could build them +/. [+ IN] 
in the bookshelf [>] „ couldn't we ? 
that's how they go . 
like that . 
like this ? 
well we won't get many in that way „ will you ? 
that's right . 
they do it like that . 
that was a lovely big tower „ isn't it ? 
you want me to build it ? 
well shall we share ? 
you do one brick and I do the next ? 
we've got the television on actually „ haven't we ? 
with pictures . 
this is Teletubbies . 
what are they doing ? 
finding sheep . 
yes . 
it's two little boys with a sheepdog . 
and they're rounding up sheep „ aren't they ? 
well perhaps it's time for the sheep to be sheared . 
or perhaps it's feeding time . 
or maybe they wanna bring the sheep inside . 
I don't know . 
<can you see> [<] how the sheepdog's working , Thomas ? 
it's running behind the sheep . 
it's gathering them all up „ isn't it ? 
you think that's Daddy ? 
oh look . 
now (.) they're taking the sheep down the road . 
out of the field . 
they're crossing the road . 
perhaps they're going into a different field . 
they must have eaten all the grass in one field , Thomas . 
so they're being taken to the next field to eat the grass in that one . 
what do you think ? 
you wish you could be a sheep ? 
what would you say if you were a sheep ? 
baa@o . 
baa baa black sheep have you any wool ? [+ R] 
<yes sir> [/] yes sir three bags full . [+ R] 
one for the master . [+ R] 
one for the dame . [+ R] 
when they take all the wool off the sheep +/. [+ IN] 
they can spin the wool . 
comb it and wash it and spin it . 
and turn it into wool which is used for knitting jumpers . 
you're wearing a woolly jumper today „ aren't you ? 
oh , Thomas . 
we were talking earlier on today +//. [+ IN] 
just let Mummy find the book that begins with the letter a@l . 
here we are . 
this book . 
do you remember ? 
when we had a look at these this morning ? 
we saw in the a@l book (.) an anchor . 
a@l for anchor . 
<and I> [>] +... [+ IN] 
well I wasn't going to put it on my head . 
++ and I said your jumper with the sailing boat has an anchor on it . 
and you're wearing it . 
look . 
that's an anchor . 
can you see ? 
once the ship or the boat comes into the harbor (.) you throw the anchor over the side . 
and it <&f> [//] makes sure that the boat doesn't go back to sea . 
look . 
can you see your anchor and that anchor in the a@l book ? 
no . 
I can't . 
no . 
I'm waiting for you to build it . 
you're stacking all the books on top of one another back in the book shelf „ aren't you ? 
are you going to do some counting while you're doing it ? 
no ? 
you could say one two three . 
or you could say a@l +... [+ IN] 
+, a@l b@l c@l . 
d@l . 
e@l f@l +... [+ IN] 
+, g@l . 
because every word <begins with a letter> [>] . 
lots_of milk ? 
is that what you're building ? 
what are you building ? 
sausages and milk ? 
oh I see . 
are you pretending you're in a shop stacking the shelves ? 
and you're filling up the shelves with milk and sausages „ are you ? 
ready to eat ? 
let's have a look . 
wow . 
<wow wow> [/] wow . 
oops . 
you just needta put two more back in „ don't you ? 
stacking <all the shelves> [>] . 
well that's Po's scooter . 
it's on Teletubbies . 
let's just check we've got all twenty six . 
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten . [+ R] 
yes . 
two tens make twenty . 
one two three four five six . [+ R] 
there are twenty six letters in the alphabet . 
and you've got twenty six little books there . 
would you like to just pull one out and we'll look at one ? 
yes please . 
I'll have a sausage <from the> [>] pile . 
thank you . 
yes [>] . 
yes . 
oh it's the x@l book again „ isn't it ? 
oh we'll look at this one with a d@l . 
oh you know what that is , Thomas . 
<what's> [<] [/] what's this ? 
a cake . 
it's actually a drum . 
d@l for drum . 
and what's that ? 
it's who ? 
a [/] a lady ? 
it's d@l for a doll . 
a bow^wow@c ? 
d@l for a dog . 
a barrow ? 
what sort of barrow , darling ? 
like a wheelbarrow ? 
a duck ? 
a duck begins with d@l . 
and that's a desk . 
yes . 
like a table . 
what's that ? 
right . 
a dress and a dolphin . 
are you going to get another one ? 
well be very careful with them , Thomas . 
because they are books . 
they're not building bricks . 
you must be very careful with books . 
no . 
Thomas ! 
no throwing . 
I'm going to get very [/] very cross if you do that again . 
you have building bricks for building . 
books +//. [+ IN] 
it's fine to stack them up but not to throw books . 
it's very naughty . 
it's not nice „ is it ? 
everything's all clear ? 
Nana and Granddad bought you those books for Christmas . 
they'd be very [/] very upset „ wouldn't they ? 
if they thought you were throwing them . 
everything's all clear . 
well you left two on the table „ didn't you ? 
bye bye . 
bye bye . 
the Teletubbies have fallen over „ have they ? 
which Teletubbies ? 
these two ? 
which two are they ? 
what are their names ? 
Lala and Po . 
the yellow and the red ones . 
you're pretending the books are rubbish now „ are you ? 
you're stacking them up . 
you're pretending to be the dustbin man ? 
because he always runs „ doesn't he ? 
he gets out of his cab and he runs round the back . 
he's not throwing those books , Thomas . 
you can put them in the back of the van . 
sorry . 
in your lorry [//] dustbin lorry . 
you're not throwing them . 
ah you're giving me a kiss ? 
oh that's lovely . 
isn't that nice ? 
are you ? 
right . 
okay . 
your say dustbin man a@p day . 
the dustbin man ? 
right . 
I wonder if I'll see the dustbin man today ? 
especially dustbin man Thomas . 
because he's my favorite . 
hello , dustbin man Thomas . 
how are you ? 
you're fine . 
you very busy today ? 
collecting [>] +... [+ IN] 
collecting all the bags . 
stuck <in one> [?] in your lorry . 
are you going to come sit on my knee a minute ? 
that would be nice „ wouldn't it ? 
hello , dustbin man . 
have you had a very busy day ? 
what have you been collecting in your rubbish bags ? 
what sort of things have people thrown away today ? 
oh banana skin and sick ? 
&=laughs . 
oh , Thomas . 
what are we going to do with you ? 
what else have you found +//. [+ IN] 
&=laughs . 
+, found ? 
oh look at that big red bus going past . 
<no it's not a fire engine> [<] . 
it's the bus that collects the little boy from down the road „ isn't it ? 
&-um what else have you found in your rubbish van ? 
sorry in your +//. [+ IN] 
oh you are picky [=? picking] in your dustbin lorry ! 
what have you found ? 
what have people been throwing away ? 
dirty skins from oranges ? 
what would we do with these ? 
we wouldn't put them in the dustbin „ would we ? 
we've got the compost bin outside „ haven't we ? 
for all things like that . 
peelings and skin and dead flowers . 
and grass clippings . 
we put them all in the compost bin „ don't we ? 
I have . 
it's the big green bin . 
not the bin we keep your toys in . 
the other green bin near the dustbin . 
outside we have the shed with Daddy's lawnmower in it and the bicycles . 
and then we have the big green dustbin that's got your lawnmower and your wheelbarrow and your footballs [>] . 
if I look on your shoulder it says dustman Ray ? 
oh I thought you were dustbin man Thomas . 
and now we have the black bin where we put the rubbish . 
and that's there . 
the black bin (.) it's the bin bags from that bin [?] that the bin men take away . 
<and then> [<] we have the green compost bin . 
alright . 
nice to see you dustbin man Thomas . 
or is it dustbin man Ray ? 
alright . 
nice to see you dustbin man Ray . 
do call again „ won't you ? 
perhaps you'd like to come for a cup of tea or something later [>] . 
bye bye . 
don't work too hard . 
oh look . 
someone else is saying goodbye . 
who's this ? 
Po Tinky_Winky Lala and Dipsy are waving to the television now . 
ah look it's Lala saying goodbye . 
bye bye , Lala . 
who do you think is going to bob out of the hole again ? 
one Teletubby always comes back . 
oh ! 
it's little Po ! 
oh . 
Po's your favorite . 
I know . 
what do you think they say now ? 
I bet it's “the sun is setting in the sky” . 
Teletubbies +... [+ IN] 
say goodbye . 
look . 
baby sun is disappearing . 
just like at night when the sun sets . 
there we are . 
disappear . 
I wonder if there's a picture of a sun in your book beginning with s@l . 
ss@o for snake . 
and ss@o for sugar . 
<and ss@o> [<] for sweet . 
and [<] +... [+ IN] 
oh it's Tweenies on television now . 
s@l for +... [+ IN] 
no [>] . 
you've just seen a sweetie book ? 
well that's a book that says o@l <an &oran> [//] and on it it has an orange . 
this book has a +/. [+ IN] 
well we'll have a look here . 
s@l for shoe . 
and sheep . 
it's Bob_the_Builder on television now ? 
and shoe . 
spider . 
sun . 
that's what we were looking for . 
squirrel . 
snake . 
and star . 
gosh . 
<they've> [?] got a lot of your favorite things . 
are you going to watch Bob_the_Builder now ? 
right . 
well you tell me what's happening . 
he's building a big house „ is he ? 
he's building a big tower like you . 
that's right . 
Bob's up a ladder . 
and he's hammering some nails (.) into some wood . 
what's the pussy cat called Thomas ? 
Pilchard . 
is that Scoop (.) Muck (.) Dizzy and Rolly ? 
Bob_the_Builder's waving ? 
right . 
well you tell me because we can't hear what's going on on the television . 
we can only see the pictures . 
you tell me what's happening . 
he's building a big line ? 
he's building a big train line „ is he ? 
like a train track ? 
do you know what he's doing there , Thomas ? 
he's hammering some nails into some wood . 
has he just wiped his nose on the back of his hand ? 
I would imagine it's very hard work and he's probably getting a bit hot and a bit sweaty . 
perhaps he just felt a bit more comfortable by wiping his face and nose with his hand . 
yes . 
like that . 
you're doing it as well . 
that's it . 
is that what he did ? 
rubbed his nose . 
looks like he's dancing „ doesn't he ? 
&=laughs . 
what do you think he was doing ? 
yes . 
<I tell you what> [?] . 
Bob_the_Builder Sam ? 
I think you're thinking of Fireman_Sam . 
Thomas , the blue machine . 
what's the blue machine called ? 
I don't . 
but the wheels looks a bit wobbly on it . 
is that Bob's wife ? 
and what's Bob's wife called ? 
Wendy and Pilchard . 
Pilchard's the blue pussy cat . 
we were going to buy a blue pussy cat for Daniel's birthday last June . 
we never found one „ did we ? 
shall we invite Daniel to come to your party ? 
no ? 
you don't want Daniel to come to your party ? 
why ? 
just Mummy and Sonia ? 
and [<] +... [+ IN] 
Isabelle and Daddy_Rod . 
I see . 
well I'm sure on the day you'll want more friends . 
funnily enough I've got the Bob_the_Builder book in front of me , Thomas . 
so I'm going to have a quick look through it and see if I can find out what the blue machine's called . 
because I think it looked (.) very much like the wheel was going to drop off . 
oh is it the crane ? 
is it Lofty_the_Crane the blue machine ? 
yes . 
it is all about Lofty . 
Lofty is a tall mobile crane . [+ R] 
he worries about all sorts of things . [+ R] 
and he talks to himself when he feels nervous . [+ R] 
he feels better when Bob and the others tell him he's doing well . [+ R] 
Lofty is scared of just about everything . [+ R] 
even heights ! [+ R] 
which is odd for a crane . [+ R] 
he doesn't like stretching up too high in case he feels giddy . [+ R] 
Lofty's favorite saying is “&-uh (.) yeah I think so” . [+ R] 
is that what he says ? 
are you very busy watching that and not wanting to talk to me ? 
there's another bus going past . 
a mini bus this time . 
actually (.) looking at this picture in Bob_the_Builder , Thomas , there are a lot of blue things . 
there's a blue pussy cat . 
a blue crane . 
what else is blue in that picture ? 
something that's very close to your heart . 
what's that ? 
a blue dustbin . 
a radiator ? 
that's a radio . 
but it is a blue <&radi &-uh> [//] radio . 
and even the post box is blue . 
that's strange „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
look at this . 
a postbox isn't red . 
it's blue . 
and you've been asking for a blue birthday cake . 
and look . 
there's a blue birthday cake . 
you wanna eat it ? 
I don't think we can eat that birthday cake . 
oh look . 
<there's> [/] there's Lofty again . 
and this is rather funny because on the television it's showing them loading up bales of straw and hay . 
and there's a page on this book and it says about hay on father pickles's farm . 
so that must be the farm that they're (.) visitting on the television at the moment . 
Lofty and Wendy are both dancing on the television „ aren't they ? 
so do you think Bob was dancing before ? 
that story on the television (.) is it called Buffalo_Bob ? 
because the last story in this book is Buffalo_Bob . 
and I just thought it +//. [+ IN] 
oh look . 
look at this . 
now isn't this strange . 
look Lofty +//. [+ IN] 
Bob and Wendy are putting hats on . 
look . 
and in the book +... [+ IN] 
are they going line dancing ? 
isn't that funny ? 
we can't hear the sound on the television but we can actually read the story together later on <because it's in the book> [>] . 
you needta look at the blue post box ? 
okay . 
there we are . 
well it [/] it says what can you find ? 
all sorts on that picture . 
no letters . 
no . 
I don't think anybody's posting letters in the letter box . 
no keyhole on the post box . 
no . 
when we look at the red post box down the road (.) there's always a keyhole . 
perhaps it's not a letter box , Thomas . 
but I can't think what else it will be . 
it is a letter box . 
perhaps it's not the one that the postman goes to . 
perhaps it's Bob and Wendy's letterbox . 
you think it's Pilchard's ? 
well it is blue „ isn't it ? 
it's Lofty's . 
do you think all the [/] the &-um (.) machines +//. [+ IN] 
I couldn't think of the name . 
+, do you think they all get letters ? 
perhaps the postman delivers them to all the post box . 
I'm just looking through this book to see if I can find a picture of Bob's house . 
just to see if the post box is outside of his house or down the street . 
I can't see anything so far . 
we'll hafta look on the television . 
no . 
that's not Daddy . 
I think it was &-uh (.) Linda and Brian next door shuting their door . 
don't you ? 
oh look . 
there's the picture of the village where Bob lives . 
can you see a blue postbox ? 
isn't that funny though ? 
I wonder where they are on the story now . 
do you think it's this one ? 
where [<] they're saying good_night ? 
because it's dark on the television now . 
and the picture in the book here it's dark . 
Wendy wears big red ear rings „ doesn't she ? 
look at the moon in the sky . 
oh [<] there . 
did you see the blue postbox then , Thomas ? 
on the television ? 
it was on the television a second ago . 
let me sit next to you then if it comes on again I can point it out . 
I think the machines must be all going to bed . 
well we might not see it again because it looks as if the program's finishing . 
but just then I glanced up and you could see it . 
some fancy wallpaper „ isn't it ? 
what [//] what's on the walls , Thomas ? 
daisys . 
the pattern on [/] on the wallpaper were some daisys . 
flowers . 
white petals and yellow centres . 
I don't think we're going to see it now „ do you ? 
I'm sure it will be on another time . 
when you're next watching [>] Bob_the_Builder watch out for a blue postbox . 
yes . 
no . 
he (h)as gone now . 
did Wendy throw her hat in the air ? 
looks [<] [/] looks like Fred and Rachael . 
or perhaps it's Rachael and baby Miles „ is it ? 
they arriving home ? 
well they must have been out somewhere . 
are you going to give her a nice wave ? 
no ? 
oh [<] she's waving . 
yes . 
she (h)as got the baby with her . 
she (h)as got little Miles „ hasn't she ? 
William's Wish Wellingtons ? 
is that the program that's on now ? 
what happens to his Wellingtons , Thomas ? 
he puts on his Wellingtons and what happens ? 
he jumps about like this ? 
alright . 
is this +//. [+ IN] 
you've started saying a lot “I wish” . 
I wish I had such and such . 
I wish I was a +... [+ IN] 
is that because you've watched this ? 
William's wish Wellingtons ? 
does [<] +... [+ IN] 
because I've never actually watched this program . 
I've seen it before but +... [+ IN] 
William's wish Wellingtons . 
what does he do ? 
put his Wellingtons on and make a wish ? 
yes . 
alright . 
get down . 
Thomas ! 
down . 
chocolate moneys ? 
where ? 
a sweet ? 
it looks like a stick of candy „ doesn't it ? 
oh yes . 
<it is> [/] it is obviously a stick of candy because he's eating it . 
does she ? 
the lady says “no more sweets” . 
do you know who that is with the patch over his eye ? 
that's what I say to you „ isn't it ? 
no more sweets . 
it's a pirate , Thomas . 
well I think it might have been William dressed up as pirate . 
look . 
he (h)as got a hat on . 
a patch over his eye . 
and [<] a parrot on his shoulder . 
oh I see . 
<all the dustbin men oh> [//] all the dustbin bags are on the road now . 
the dustbin men are coming „ are they ? 
you just run over my slipper ? 
you wanted to smell it ? 
oh I wouldn't do that , Thomas . 
that's not very pleasant „ is it ? 
oh look . 
it's the dustbin man . 
hello , dustbin man . 
I thought you were a dustbin man .

they've spread out the picnic rug . 
and the plates .

<so did you get something> [<] else to drink ? 
a glass of wine ? 
they gave you some wine „ did they ? 
oh well it didn't make you sleep is all I can say . 
you didn't sleep any better on Wednesday night . 
no . 
I don't somehow think you're telling me the truth „ are you ? 
what's this , Thomas ? 
what is it ? 
are you pointing to something on your bicycle ? 
oh that's a little screw holding your bicycle together . 
it's holding the framework together . 
I think what you can actually do , Thomas +//. [+ IN] 
Daddy can do this for you but we don't needta alter it . 
you can put your screwdriver in like Bob_the_Builder does . 
and you can turn it round and then you can raise or lower the handlebars . 
you can make them go up higher . 
that's the brake . 
if you're going somewhere and you wanna park your bicycle on the hill you can put the brake on . 
that's the hubcap . 
it's just holding the wheel together . 
the tyre . 
that's the tyre . 
the rubber tyre . 
the [<] +... [+ IN] 
the tyre is the outside of the wheel . 
that's the mudflap . 
the mudguard . 
and [>] +... [+ IN] 
that's all the frame of the bicycle . 
do you know what these are ? 
what's under there ? 
I don't know . 
I can't see . 
you're underneath . 
it's all of the frame of the bicycle <I would imagine> [>] . 
that's the bottom of the seat where you sit . 
the saddle . 
do you know what these green things are , Thomas , here ? 
do you know what those are ? 
pedals . 
pedals for your feet to work the pedals . 
and then the bicycle wheels go round . 
right . 
shall we stop and have that drink now ? 
no ? 
okay . 
you want me to sit down ? 
is it really about little red riding hood ? 
because it does look like a picture of a wolf . 
I wonder if I'll see dustbin man Thomas again today . 
I bet he's still asleep because it's early in the morning . 
I bet he hasn't got out of bed yet . 
the dustbin man +... [+ IN] 
hello [<] ! 
good morning , dustbin man . 
you've run to see me ? 
ah . 
oh you're giving me another big hug and a big kiss „ aren't you ? 
ah . 
oh that's nice . 
ah . 
ah . 
oh what a nice cuddle . 
just looking on the television at the story of little red riding hood (.) do you remember going to Molly's party in December ? 
yes . 
well <it was> [//] there was a magician . 
a children's entertainer . 
he was doing all sorts of things „ wasn't he ? 
and then at the end of the party he gave a little puppet show . 
and it was little red riding hood . 
he popped out ? 
do you remember what the wolf dressed as ? 
he got into bed and put a hairnet on and pretended to be somebody . 
who was it ? 
Granddad_Bealby . 
I think he was pretending to be Grandma „ wasn't he ? 
don't throw those . 
do you remember that ? 
Granddad_Lastname ? 
well the fox tried to trick little red riding hood into thinking it was her grandmother . 
and she said “oh grandmother what hairy arms you have” . 
+" what a deep voice you have . 
do you remember that story ? 
oh Bella (h)as not got anything to wear ? 
what are they doing now ? 
looking in a box ? 
is it dressing up now ? 
right . 
they're dressing up „ are they ? 
I get mixed up , Thomas . 
the lady in the pink (.) is that Fizz ? 
and the lady in the yellow is Bella ? 
well I think they're little girls actually rather than ladys „ aren't they ? 
it looks to me as if Jake (.) or perhaps that's Milo (.) is going to be a pirate . 
what are they putting on ? 
she's putting on some beads . 
look . 
fancy necklace . 
she's nothing to wear has she ? 
not anything to wear . 
is that what she's saying ? 
oh dear . 
you want what my darling ? 
well they all seem to have plenty of things . 
but they're not putting them on „ are they ? 
is she getting very upset because she (h)as nothing to wear ? 
I've just gone into our box . 
and we've got a book here . 
fairy tales . 
and one of them is red riding hood . 
<I think> [>] [?] +... [+ IN] 
you're a newspaper boy now „ are you ? 
oh I see . 
you're delivering a newspaper . 
look at this . 
one morning little red riding hoods mother asked her to take a basket of fruit to her Grandma who was in bed and not feeling very well . [+ R] 
“you go straight to Grandma's house” said her mother . [+ R] 
and dressed her in her red cape and hood . [+ R] 
on her way through the wood little red riding hood met a wolf who asked her where she was going . [+ R] 
“to see my Grandma who is ill in bed” said <little red riding hood> [>] . [+ R] 
don't throw those books , Thomas . 
well they might be newspapers but I think we're going to put them away now . 
I don't like you throwing them . 
I'm not happy about that at all . 
come on . 
let's put the books away now . 
well it might not be fair , Thomas . 
but it's not fair to throw them on the floor <and damage them> [>] . 
you needta be a postbox ? 
you need me to be a postbox ? 
I see . 
you're posting things into me „ are you ? 
look . 
they've all got something to wear now . 
look . 
can you see this picture book ? 
where does she live asked the wolf . [+ R] 
at the cottage in the woods said little red riding hood without thinking . [+ R] 
and before she knew what had happened the wolf turned and ran off . [+ R] 
the wolf ran straight to the cottage where Grandma lived . [+ R] 
and when he arrived he knocked at the door . [+ R] 
“who is there” called Grandma . [+ R] 
and the wolf replied “it's little red riding hood , Grandma” . [+ R] 
lift the latch . [+ R] 
oh sorry (.) wrong voice . 
“lift the latch and come in” said Grandma . [+ R] 
when she saw the wolf she was so frightened she hid herself in the cupboard . [+ R] 
the wolf quickly put on Grandma's nightcap and waited for little red riding hood to arrive . [+ R] 
“who is there” he called in a voice like Grandma's when he heard her knock . [+ R] 
it's little red riding hood she answered . [+ R] 
“lift the latch” and come in said wolf . [+ R] 
how are you feeling said little red riding hood . [+ R] 
“much better thank you dear” said the wolf . [+ R] 
as he spoke his bedcap [: nightcap] [* s:r] slipped from his head so little red riding hood could see his ears . [+ R] 
what big ears you have said little red riding hood nervously . [+ R] 
all the better to hear you with said the wolf . [+ R] 
what big teeth you have said little red riding hood . [+ R] 
all the better to eat you with shouted the wolf as he jumped out of bed . [+ R] 
“you're not my Grandma” screamed little red riding hood . [+ R] 
no . [+ R] 
I'm the big bad wolf and I'm going to eat you up . [+ R] 
oh ! 
as little red riding hood ran from the house the wood cutter who was cutting some trees outside heard her cries for help . [+ R] 
he chased the wolf down the path and the wolf ran into the woods as fast as he could . [+ R] 
the wood cutter took little red riding hood back into the cottage to see if the nasty wolf had eaten her Grandma . [+ R] 
as they called her a voice said “I'm in the cupboard (.) is it safe to come out” ? [+ R] 
when Grandma heard little red riding hood's voice she knew that all was well . [+ R] 
oh how lucky we both are to be safe said little red riding hood as she hugged her Grandma . [+ R] 
they both thanked the wood cutter and asked him to stay for his tea . [+ R] 
oh that's nice „ isn't it ? 
so everybody was safe and sound in the end „ weren't they ? 
and the nasty wolf didn't get Grandma . 
he didn't get little red riding hood „ did he ? 
I'll eat you all up in my tummy . 
is that what he was saying ? 
yes . 
I know . 
naughty wolf . 
you wanna hold my hand while we sit down ? 
you want me to sit down ? 
well what would you like me to do now ? 
eat my tummy ? 
why do you think you're a big bad wolf ? 
who's afraid of the big bad wolf . [+ R] 
the big bad wolf [/] the big bad wolf . [+ R] 
who's afraid of the big red wolf . [+ R] 
I think that's the story of the three little pigs „ isn't it ? 
and the wolf says to them “I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll” +... [+ IN] 
+, blow your house down . 
that's right . 
so one story the wolf's saying “I'll eat you up for supper” . 
and the other one's saying “I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down” . 
you're going to +/. [+ IN] 
you're going to eat my bottom ? 
or smack it ? 
oh you're eating me all up „ are you ? 
ah do I taste nice ? 
good . 
it's +/. [+ IN] 
I taste lovely „ do I ? 
oh I'm pleased . 
you're making some funny noises . 
have you swallowed me ? 
oh you're pating me now . 
oh , Thomas . 
that's rough . 
<no no> [/] no . 
not so hard , love . 
is Milo pretending to be the wood cutter that we just heard in the story ? 
and is Max pretending to be Granddad ? 
and which Tweenie is little red riding hood ? 
so is Bella pretending to be little red riding hood ? 
and who is Fizz ? 
little red riding hood's mother ? 
ah did you hear that Thomas ? 
they said they were going to live happily ever after . 
nearly all fairy storys start with the words once upon a time . 
and they nearly all end with we all lived happily ever after . 
are you going to sing along ? 
0 [=! hums] . 
you can . 
you know the words . 
the day that teddy bears have their picnic . [+ R] 
Mil [//] Milo's saying they're only safe because he chased the wolf . 
wasn't [<] that funny ? 
so the [/] the Tweenies started off today with a teddy bear's picnic . 
and they must have been singing “if you go down to the woods today you're in for a big surprise” . 
well that's exactly what happened to little red riding hood when she went through the woods to see her grandmother . 
she was in for a big surprise . 
there's another story about somebody going through a wood and having a big surprise . 
do you know who that was ? 
Cinderella and the three bears . 
do you remember ? 
Cinderella went for a walk „ didn't she ? 
and she was so busy looking at the flowers and smelling them and picking them that she wasn't really looking where she was going . 
and before she knew what had happened she (h)ad lost her way and she couldn't find her way home . 
then she came across that little cottage „ didn't she ? 
and she went inside and there were three of everything . 
there were three bowls of porridge on the table . 
three place settings set . 
three chairs ready for three bears . 
and she tried all the porridge . 
and in the big bowl it was too salty . 
<and the little> [//] and the middle bowl it was too sweet . 
and the small bowl was just right . 
and she ate all the porridge up . 
then she went upstairs into the bedroom . 
and what happened then ? 
she went to sleep . 
a big bed . 
a medium sized bed . 
and a little bed . 
and she went to sleep in one „ didn't she ? 
and the three bears came home from their walk in the park . 
and they all said “who (h)as been eating my porridge” ? 
then they went upstairs . 
who (h)as been sleeping in my bed ? 
and what was the little girl called ? 
missus do do do ? 
it was Goldilocks . 
and that's the story of Goldilocks and the three bears . 
so this is why , Thomas , when we go out for our walks together +/. [+ IN] 
you're a breakdown lorry „ are you ? 
now ? 
you're a dustbin lorry . 
well when we go for walks in the woods and in the park (.) Mummy always says “hold Mummy's hand” „ doesn't she ? 
because you don't wanna get lost . 
there's nothing to be frightened of in the park . 
it's a lovely place to play . 
but you should always stay quite close to Mummy . 
you look tired now . 
are you tired ? 
you want a sip of Coca_Cola „ do you ? 
okay . 
well we can have a drink . 
I think it's time for a drink now „ don't you ? 
just a minute . 
what are you looking at now ? 
the jigsaw ? 
you're looking at the strawberries on the jigsaw ? 
oh wow . 
yes . 
well perhaps it's a fruit lorry . 
I don't know . 
it's a picture of a delivery lorry with a huge strawberry on . 
so perhaps it's carrying strawberry yoghurts . 
or perhaps it's a fruit lorry .
