I see .

<that's right> [<] .

that's a hard green . 
it does look like an ice cream that „ doesn't it ? 
it looks nice and soft the white one as well . 
Grace [<] must not have used the white one because this one's ever so hard „ isn't it ? 
is there sposta be a black one , Thomas ?

no (.) but was there a black Play_Doh ? 
ah (.) what was in the pot that was black ? 
was that the tiny one that I said looked like a sweet with little bits <on the top> [>] ?

Grace must have used all that up „ mustn't she ?

pink [<] ice cream . 
I might make some rock . 
it has (.) yes . 
well the black lid's there (.) look . 
but there's no black Play_Doh .

and maybe she (h)ad hadta throw it away . 
this one here ? 
it's very hard that +/. [+ IN] 
you feel that now and look at this . 
<this is> [<] orange Play_Doh that we must have played with before .

we've got orange (.) green (.) red (.) and bright pink . 
and it's called soft stuff .

the ice cream factory ? 
it looks like a little tub of ice cream that „ doesn't it ? 
is it ? 
was there some yellow Play_Doh or was the yellow pot empty as well ? 
was it ? 
oy (.) I was going to make a little ice cream cone with yellow . 
perhaps +/. [+ IN] 
we haven't got any black . 
I'll make it with this „ shall I ?

to make ice cream at home . 
and (.) yeah it is quite nice „ isn't it ? 
<I'd like> [/] I'd like one of those .

does it ? 
and is this machine in a factory , Thomas ? 
what sort of factory ? 
oh it just makes ice cream „ does it ?

well actually they do peas as well . 
so (.) that would be a nice factory to get stuck in . 
ah ha ha ha ha what's coming to get you ? 
ah (.) my poor crab .

oh should they ? 
in cages ? 
crabs run on the beach . 
they're in the sea . 
and sometimes they're in the windows of the fishmonger in Didsbury .

or Sainsbury . 
you know the fish counter ? 
we see them there „ don't we ? 
crabs . 
have you not seen crabs ? 
I thought the last time we went to Didsbury you showed me a crab in the window . 
sitting there like this one (.) but they're not <this color> [>] . 
they're not green . 
oh (.) no they're real crabs . 
it's just they're not living anymore . 
that's why they're not moving around . 
is that what you thought ? 
oh (..) actually the fish counter at Sainsbury (..) they have some lobsters which look a little bit like this . 
now they're not real (.) they're just for show „ aren't they ? 
is that what you're thinking of ? 
a little rock in the squasher ? 
&=laughs . 
oh a look ! 
I thought you said a rock . 
there's the swan . 
oh dear . 
does he ? 
oh well the crab should be alright then because he's green „ isn't he ? 
and here comes an elephant . 
with his trunk .

the crab hospital ? 
and see if we can do him a new arm . 
alright .

I've brought a poorly crab and he (h)as only got one leg .

oh , Thomas , you cutting his legs off ? 
oh [=! makes noise] . 
++ stick them back on . 
I [<] [/] I see .

there we are . 
a green sheep to go with the green crab and the green swan and the green and red elephant . 
you're good tidying up „ aren't you ? 
this looks like an orange brick . 
a bit hard . 
listen [<] to that . 
oh [>] . 
oh_gosh (.) right . 
can he ? 
oh well <he must> [>] be better then . 
let's have a look at him . 
he's still asleep actually after his operation „ isn't he ? 
I don't think the swan (h)as done anything . 
she might have broke [*] her wing I suppose . 
we better check her out . 
do you think when the come +/. [+ IN] 
like the crab ? 
you're going to hafta cut the wing off „ are you ?

taking something off one swan and putting it on another . 
is that what you mean ? 
ah [>] . 
oh so you took it +//. [+ IN] 
ah well (.) that's better then „ isn't it ?

I might make a wafer now . 
this is lovely and soft „ isn't it „ this one ? 
beautiful . 
what is it ? 
is it the little man ? 
check him over then and see what you think . 
no ? 
can't he ? 
oh dear (.) well perhaps he (h)as got something the matter with him then . 
no ? 
blood's rushing out of the lamb „ is it „ as well ? 
well (.) I think if somebody (h)as got blood rushing out of them (.) I think that probably is a bit of a problem somewhere „ don't you ? 
you can't be bothered to look ? 
oy (.) poor little lamb . 
I have a lot of pets . 
I've got an elephant (.) I've got a swan (.) I've got a crab and I've got a lamb . 
the elephant's alright ?

if he hadta come into hospital he'd need a jolly big bed , Thomas .

nearly over a half an hour . 
could the ice cream van not come round like our ice cream man does ? 
ah [>] . 
so he's just <gonna drive> [<] to Didsbury .

it does look like a piece of crab „ doesn't it ? 
can you hear that noise ? 
what do you think that is ? 
somebody's alarm ? 
two lying down elephants ?
