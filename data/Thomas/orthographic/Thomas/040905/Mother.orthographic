one more (.) time (.) can mean (..) five or six .

I finally learned how to use my climb on slide and poor Mummy can't get me off it now . 
it's great how one more time can mean five or six . 
that's like you . 
I say one more time . 
and you end up having about five or six more times „ don't you ?

Thomas ! 
she doesn't (.) but that's what little girls do . 
she's not smelly and gooey . 
and she doesn't always show her knickers . 
anyway it was very nice of her to write . 
she can't really write . 
it was her Mummy writing the letter . 
she's too young „ isn't she ? 
mind you (.) the thing is actually , Thomas , it was her birthday a long time ago . 
but [//] &-um (.) because we don't see her very often +//. [+ IN] 
do you remember I bought that book ? 
that nursery one ? 
oh you don't remember that either ? 
and I wrapped it up and we took it to Nana's but we [/] we didn't take it till about two months after her birthday . 
and then it sat at Nana's house for a while (.) before Nana delivered it to her .

I know you've got a camera one . 
no camera . 
well no (.) it isn't no cameras actually .

the police accident one's good , Thomas .

who can have accident ? 
no I'd rather not really . 
well an accident day means we all have lots_of accidents „ doesn't it ?

no jeans allowed . 
and I remember my friends finding that very [/] very funny when we went out one night . 
and they said oh you can't come in because there's no jeans allowed . 
mind you it also said jeans and trainers . 
so if there was anybody called trainer they couldn't come in either .

you can't leave the house without breakfast inside you . 
oh no if you've got chicken pox (..) I can't leave you at home .

<too much information> [>] .

why ? 
I'm really disappointed with this . 
I [/] I bought this yoghurt the other day in the supermarket . 
<no no> [/] no . 
it's greek yoghurt which I like . 
but <I thought> [/] I thought I'd picked up the one that said greek yoghurt with honey . 
because I'm having it with my cereal . 
I got a nutty cereal and greek yoghurt . 
and I thought the greek yoghurt had honey in . 
anyway it's okay .

you having a topsy+turvy day „ are you ?

I think we'll be out at lunchtime today .

and then after breakfast I'm going to go and have a bath and wash my hair . 
and you needta get ready . 
I might hafta , Thomas , xxx [>] +... [+ IN] 
oh no <the red> [/] the red light's fine . 
that's fine . 
<the orange light> [//] if the orange light flickers that means the sound's not going to work properly . 
it's &ab [/] absolutely fine I think . 
mhm . 
oh [<] . 
Jeannine gave us a new lead for the equipment . 
but it seems to be something to do with the aerial . 
I think that's more the problem . 
anyway it's fine now „ isn't it „ because Daddy had a look at the aerial for me . 
<and it seems> [<] perfect this morning . 
well I've not seen it go off at all this morning . 
did it . 
well it seems stable most of the time which is (.) a good thing . 
mhm . 
perhaps it thinks it's Christmas lights flashing on and off . 
no I hope it isn't because it must be very annoying trying to listen to it when the sound's going on and off . 
the trouble is you see half the time I didn't realize because when I started the equipment +//. [+ IN] 
as long as both work +//. [+ IN] 
oh [!] both lights were working (..) and the battery was okay then I presumed it was so we carried on and then I found out afterwards that at lot of the times it had gone off . 
guess what ? 
battery needs replacing in this one . 
even though the orange light's on here the <battery xxx > [>] . [+ PI] 
so we'll just have a few minutes +... [+ IN] 
right . 
I was just a bit panicky then because I've replaced the battery and I put the headphones on to check that sound was coming through and nothing was happening . 
and then I realized I'd forgotten to press the record button on the (.) equipment . 
<no don't put it> [<] +... [+ IN] 
well no (.) put it in the bin please . 
it's because when the little rubber end is on the batteries I know it's a new battery . 
when the end's come off (.) it means it's been in the machine and it's old and needs to be thrown away . 
well I'll only know that when it's in the bin . 
because if we think that's a new battery (.) the next time the red light comes on and we replace the batteries (..) we'll be stuck „ won't we ? 
you know what a flat battery means „ don't you ? 
very flat . 
it doesn't mean it's squashed it means there's no power . 
all the energy's run out . 
it's flat . 
it's like lemonade .

you've got to have breakfast .

where [//] is there a Mark's_and_Spencer's bag ? 
oh that's alright (.) yes . 
that should go in the bin now , Thomas . 
have you seen what's in that bag on the floor , Thomas ? 
be gentle with it because it's for a present . 
no not a present <for you> [>] . 
it's a present for somebody else [>] . 
what's that ? 
it's a photograph of you for Nana and Grandad .

let's have a little look .

watch all those clothes hanging up there please because they've just been ironed . 
<well I think it's> [<] fine where it is „ isn't it ? 
I don't think I'll have the hoover out this morning . 
I'll move it before I do the hoovering . 
I'll put it at the bottom of the stairs . 
well because the stairs are quite dangerous things „ aren't they ? 
you've got to take care of the &stain [//] stairs so a caution sign (.) will warn you before you went up or if we came down . 
caution stairs . 
take care . 
what does ? 
pear and stair . 
mhm it does . 
you're right . 
now what I'd like you to do is pick up that cone sign (.) and prop it up somewhere because if it's left on the floor it will be dangerous because they're quite slippy if they're trodden on .

those [<] are little (.) &-um (.) stones that you put on your driveway . 
so did you take it from a display ?

just think (.) they'd end up with a xxx bag at the end of the day . [+ PI] 
that's why prices are so high in the shops , Thomas .

Thomas , it's a little bit of milk .

your hands are wiped your arms are wiped . 
well never mind . 
there we are . 
you'll be changing your pajamas in a minute .

whereabouts ? 
no I wiped it off . 
<there we are> [<] . 
let's put that towel [?] over there . 
there you are . 
then there's a towel in_between your knees xxx . [+ PI] 
hey (.) come on . 
what's the matter this morning ? 
you didn't want breakfast „ did you ? 
oh , Thomas .

there's a clean bowl (.) clean spoon (.) everywhere's been wiped +... [+ IN] 
little kiss . 
come on (.) don't be so upset (.) because +... [+ IN] 
you've just got to learn now that when we're having a meal (.) you just sit (.) nice and straight <and you eat properly> [>] . 
alright [<] . 
alright [/] alright . 
alright . 
so that happened when you were sitting still so imagine what would happen if you were messing about . 
hm: ? 
there we are . 
I'll get you a drink and you can xxx . [+ PI] 
you're right I do get cross when you [/] when you mess about . 
<no (.) I know> [<] .

right there you are . 
now have a drink . 
I'm going to have some apple . 
okay (.) that's fine . 
<oh come on> [=! laugh] . 
well you see this is why I (.) thought you might have had some yoghurt . 
do you feel very thirsty this morning ? 
Thomas ?

what's the matter ? 
you didn't seem very poorly before you started your breakfast . 
where are you poorly ? 
in your tummy ? 
okay . 
well just try to eat a little bit of xxx then , sweetheart . [+ PI] 
come on you're just upset now . 
you'll be fine in a minute . 
think about something else . 
xxx [<] . 
did he ? 
well if he walked in his own doorway that's fine because he lives there . 
I've just seen Steve going in as well with a paper . 
just on the other side of the road . 
perhaps [<] he thought the best thing was to <leave his> [>] car +... [+ IN] 
because he hadta sort of back out round the van and he used our drive . 
perhaps he thought (.) oh I'll move the car (.) while I can get on Thomas's drive (..) because if Thomas's Daddy comes home (.) and blocks the drive (.) I won't be able to get out . 
and he might needta go to work later . 
so I think he's just reversed round the van and parked on the other side of the road for a quick getaway . 
hm: ? 
are there [>] ? 
Nick ? 
which Nick ? 
hm: . 
I don't think Nick the hairdresser would be driving a white van „ do you ? 
does he look a little bit like Nick ? 
his tricycle ? 
<I've never> [<] seen Nick the hairdresser riding a tricycle xxx . [+ PI] 
xxx [<] . 
mhm . 
just think (.) he could have a lot of people in the hairdressers (.) and he could cycle up and down +... [+ IN] 
+, trimming all the backs of their hair then twizzing@n people round xxx as he passed them and cutting all the fringes . [+ PI] 
&-uh +/. [+ IN] 
+, steady . 
but that's +/. [+ IN] 
&=laughs mhm . 
well yes I would imagine hairdressers hafta concentrate otherwise they could very easily cut somebody's ear off . 
oh dear . 
oh dear no ear . 
I've no idea . 
would you ? 
&=laughs [<] . 
well I have tried yours but I'm too big „ aren't I ? 
well I can sit on but I can't pedal because my knees are right up to my waist . 
I'm not sure (.) I was thinking about your tricycle you know . [+ PI] 
because Linda who Mummy works with +... [+ IN] 
I think her little boy Matthew got (.) one of those &-um +... [+ IN] 
I've forgotten what they're called [/] called but you know the little cars that you love to ride round in at toddler group ? 
the yellow and red ones ? 
well he's getting one of those for his birthday . 
well he's got one of those for his birthday . 
and she said they didn't know whether to get a car or a tricycle . 
and in the end somebody (.) I think Grandma bought him a car . 
and I wondered (.) really your tricycle is getting a little bit small for you now „ isn't it ? 
<you don't use it> [>] . 
<I know you like it> [<] +... [+ IN] 
it's just one of those [>] +... [+ IN] 
<xxx fast xxx > [<] smaller legs then me . [+ PI] 
I just wondered whether we should give it to Matthew . 
do you not think so ? 
but you've got your big bike now „ haven't you ? 
no it's not . 
your big bicycle's <a big bicycle> [>] . 
no it's not . 
we have got to think about moving and getting rid of one or two toys , Thomas , that you don't play with . 
and I know you do still use your bicycle occasionally inside (.) but I can't remember the last time I saw you using it . 
yesterday ? 
xxx you were four . [+ PI] 
well that's it (.) when you get to five you don't really need a little tricycle like that . 
hm: . 
I bought that bicycle +... [+ IN] 
when (..) when you were a baby I gave up work . 
I didn't wanna go out to work . 
and then I started working with (..) Dimitra and Jean [//] &-uh Jeannine . 
and the first time I got paid I <was so excited> [>] +... [+ IN] 
+, about getting a job +... [+ IN] 
+, that Daddy and I went to John_Lewis and bought +//. [+ IN] 
well I say we bought (.) I bought with my first wages your little tricycle . 
because (..) Nana and Grandad_Bealby had bought you your swing . 
I was going to buy you a swing (.) but Nana and Grandad_Bealby came to stay and they gave us some money to buy the swing with . 
pardon ? 
well (.) they gave us money to buy it and we bought it (.) and Daddy put it up . 
excuse me . 
no [/] no he brought it in the car . 
mhm [<] . 
and Nana and Grandad also bought you Dobbin your new rocking horse . 
and [<] +... [+ IN] 
well again (.) yes this is what I mean . 
you know the rocking horse now is [/] is really too small for you , love . 
the only thing is I would say (.) with all these things (.) they're nice when little children come . 
the [/] the rocking horse is lovely because when Abigail and Sarah come and people like that (.) they can go on the rocking horse . 
whereas the tricycle +//. [+ IN] 
<if we've got visitors> [//] if we've got a house full of visitors and they bring little children then I always hide your tricycle anyway because the tricycle's fine for you to whiz up and down with inside when there's just me and you (.) or me and you and Daddy (.) but when there's a houseful of people there isn't room for the tricycle . 
I usually just put it in the shed . 
you know if we have a big party +//. [+ IN] 
well I say a big party (.) if we've got a lot of people here (.) not a big party +//. [+ IN] 
but +/. 
yes (.) that many people . 
&-um (.) when I know there's little children I always leave Dobbin out because I know that the girls like to play with Dobbin . 
&-um (.) and baby Ben he liked that as well „ didn't he ? 
baby Ben over the road . 
Rachel's [<] baby Ben . 
you know which Rachel . 
your bottom's sore ? 
&-um (.) so yes (.) there's a few things . 
and your bead coaster is a toy that I never really wanna part with because I like playing with that and Daddy likes playing with that . 
it's nice „ isn't it ? 
we'll keep that forever . 
and things like Dobbin and the tricycle I would like to [/] to think that somebody was using them nicely . 
but I think at the moment I would quite like to &s +//. [+ IN] 
oh [>] ! 
be careful . 
there's your tissue . 
+, I'd quite like to keep Dobbin here . 
<anyway I was telling you> [>] (.) that Nana and Grandad had bought you a swing which I was going to get . 
so I said to Daddy when I get paid I shall buy Thomas a tricycle because we've been wanting one for a long time . 
and I was so excited going in the shop and getting it for you . 
and it [/] it came with a handle . 
do you remember the handle that we've now got in the cupboard ? 
when you useta ride outside and we useta have you on a (..) a little panel [?] „ didn't we ? 
you see (.) really I hope Auntie_Thomas [% relative] and Uncle_Jessica [% relative] have a baby . 
and then I [>] +... [+ IN] 
<yeah (.) oh yes> [<] . 
I hadn't thought of that . 
yes (.) of course . 
when you've got the handle on your tricycle it does look like a police motorbike . 
because we've got all these things that we needta pass to somebody . 
mhm [=! laughs] . 
well you needta pass the honey loops through your lips and into your tummy „ don't you ? 
is your tummy feeling a bit better now ? 
no . 
oh (.) okay . 
oh thank you . 
oh I'll have the ticket machine now for honey loop ? 
oh [=! makes noise] no (.) now look (.) keep your [>] spoon over your bowl , Thomas . 
this is what happened before . 
and then you got upset . 
don't play with your spoon (.) when you're eating . 
what might shoot out of it ? 
Jessica [?] [% MOT] ? 
what do you mean ? 
I don't understand what you're saying . 
I'm called Snuggy „ am I ? 
yes . 
oh [>] . 
I see . 
I'll try . 
<thank you> [/] thank you very much . 
oops (.) we've dropped it . 
thank you . 
oh [<] it's very soggy with milk „ isn't it ? 
I'm afraid they're a little bit too sweet for me . 
when I was growing up we useta have something that tasted like that . 
I think they were called something else and I can't think what they were . 
sweetum@c ? 
no . 
we always had Cornflakes and Rice_krispies . 
and then +//. [+ IN] 
oh Frosties . 
oh (.) well they still do Frosties . 
have you had Frosties ? 
the Tiger . 
you know we've got some cereal bowls with the Tiger in the bottom ? 
Frosties . 
and I useta have something else with (..) little bits of dry raspberry in . 
I can't think what they were called [>] . 
I can see Kathleen's bedroom window . 
there is a white cat and a ginger cat . 
<the ginger cat's> [<] lying down and the ginger cat's sitting up . 
both looking out . 
a purple roof ? 
that's a purple drainpipe „ isn't it ? 
so I can't think what other cereals there were , Thomas . 
I know there were things like Shreddies . 
&-um (.) shredded wheat and Weetabixes . 
and porridge . 
oh Ready_Brek . 
and I useta have this cereal with tiny pieces of dried raspberry and I can't think what that was called (.) but (.) we had some the other day with Special_K with little bits of fruit in it . 
so I really can't think [>] +... [+ IN] 
chicken ones ? 
I can't think for the life of me think what the cereal was called that tasted like that . 
it was something called Ricicles . 
but I can't think what Ricicles were . 
tricycles [<] . 
yes we're back to tricycles . 
bicycles and icicles . 
there useta be an advert . 
Ricicles and icicles as nice as you can eat . 
oh [<] . 
isn't it strange how I can't think what on earth is it ? 
xxx have a look . [+ PI] 
well when I'm next talking to Nana I'll say can you remember what cereal I useta eat when I was a little girl . 
I know she useta (..) make porridge and Ready_Brek and she useta cook +... [+ IN] 
has she ? 
Nana useta do me things like poached egg on toast and scrambled egg on toast . 
I think Nana looked after me better than I look after you . 
in the morning we just <rush rush> [/] rush and get something to eat quick and off . 
thank you , darling . 
very much . 
right (.) now leave your spoon where it is xxx <end up> [>] on the floor . [+ PI] 
it was Nana <that started you> [>] +... [+ IN] 
+, with honey nut loops [>] . 
<no it wouldn't> [<] . 
xxx got upset when that happened before . [+ PI] 
<so I don't> [<] see how it would be good now „ do you ? 
mhm [<] . 
I would . 
yes . 
gorgeous sunflower . 
it's not very gorgeous outside though „ is it ? 
<I don't> [<] think it can get any higher now , love . 
well yes (.) because it's in the conservatory window so they're bound to see it „ aren't they ? 
I think sunflower seeds must be the easiest to grow . 
incredible how quickly they shoot up „ isn't it ? 
no . 
you know at school (.) in nursery (.) they always get you to grow that mustard and cress as well . 
you know cress that grows +//. [+ IN] 
cress seeds grow very easily „ don't they ? 
pardon ? 
<no it's not> [<] . 
<no it's not> [<] . 
no , Thomas , you can't . 
you can have some fruit if you like . 
well we're going to get washed and dressed in a minute . 
<xxx „ won't we> [<] ? [+ PI] 
xxx [>] . 
yes (.) I think you can for a few minutes . 
<well what> [<] sort of fruit would you like ? 
<an &app> [<] +... [+ IN] 
an apple . 
okay .
