did you say the green light was on ? 
pardon ? 
oh good . 
good . 
well that's the microphone . 
so we need those lights on „ don't we ? 
because if the lights aren't on it means the batterys have gone flat and it's not working properly . 
so we hafta keep looking „ don't we ? 
to check that the green light is on . 
well yes . 
when we look at the actual piece of equipment the orange light +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
it comes on . 
it means that it's plugged into the electricity . 
and when the green lights come on it means that the batterys are working . 
<so when> [//] and when the little red light on [//] is on it means the machine itself is turned on . 
so we've got to look at the red light on the machine . 
the green light on these two microphones . 
and then on the monitors we've got to check there's a green and a red light . 
so that's five lights we've got to look for . 
and the other day what happened ? 
no electricity . 
I forgotten what day that was . 
was it Monday ? 
we [<] [/] we plugged everything in and checked it was working (.) turned the microphones on . 
they were working . 
then we did a recording „ didn't we ? 
and then when it finished +/. [+ IN] 
+, you wanted a drink of milk . 
well probably sweeties as well . 
and when we went to warm the milk nothing in the kitchen worked . 
so we turned the television on . 
that didn't work . 
there was no electricity „ was there ? 
and then when we listened to our recording . 
it hadn't recorded anything „ had it ? 
because the electricity must have gone off just after I checked that the lights were on . 
and what I normally do is I just check +//. [+ IN] 
once we've checked initially that those are working we just check these two „ don't we ? 
to look for green lights . 
yes . 
we never went back to see if there were green and orange lights „ did we ? 
so that was a complete waste of time . 
and then what did we find had happened ? 
when we out for a walk ? 
what had happened to the lamp post ? 
do you remember when we went down (.) not our road we walked round Kempstone ? 
Kempstone_Avenue ? 
somebody had hit the lamp post „ hadn't they ? 
it had fallen down . 
and there were all bollards and cones and pieces of wood round it . 
and Norweb boards . 
and then we saw the Norweb van outside and we realized that must have been what had happened . 
somebody had hit the lamp post and they (h)ad hadta turn the electricity off to mend it . 
Thomas , honey nut loops (.) Cornflakes or Rice_Krispies ? 
please . 
you'd like some crisps in a red packet ? 
you mean the Honey_Nut_Loop crisps ? 
I haven't got any , darling .

these are Honey_Nut_Loops not Hula_Hoops .

Hula_Hoops . 
I haven't got any Hula_Hoops . 
if I had them you could have them . 
well how about Cornflakes or Rice_Krispies ? 
well don't start getting upset because we haven't got any and that's the end of it , Thomas . 
what about some toast ? 
or a piece of apple or banana ? 
you've got to eat something for breakfast .

I'll make you toast .

I'm sorry .

I'm sorry . 
oh dear . 
you're alright . 
I've made it in this beaker . 
I've put a lid on it for if we're going out later on . 
well if you go out later on . 
I'm going to work . 
what for ? 
to bring in some pennys . 
oh +//. [+ IN] 
&=laughs . 
what you want me to go out to work to earn some pennys so you can play with the pennys ? 
oh I see . 
right . 
I've poured it from the beaker into this little Winne_the_Pooh cup . 
but please be careful . 
don't spill it . 
who's there ? 
who (h)as just come in ? 
Purdie_Pussy ?

how about your Winnie_the_Pooh spoon to go with your Winnie_the_Pooh mug ? 
oh look .

I hadn't realized . 
we're all coordinated „ aren't we ?

Winnie_the_Pooh spoon ? 
it is . 
look . 
it (h)as got Winnie_the_Pooh on the top . 
we haven't got one with Winnie_the_Pooh on there . 
he's just on the end . 
the Winnie_the_Pooh knife fork and spoon came from Auntie_Charlotte and Uncle_Dave . 
and the Winnie_the_Pooh plate bowl and cup you're drinking from came from Mummy's friend Anne . 
and you've got some Teletubbies plates and bowls . 
and a nice Po mug „ haven't you ? 
and you've got +/. [+ IN]

plates [<] cups and bowls .

Thomas_The_Tank . 
and what (h)as the other one got on it ? 
Henry . 
that's right . 
because that's your name „ isn't it ? 
is there a little boy at nursery called James ? 
he (h)as been rough ? 
you banged your head ? 
oh dear . 
when was this ? 
oh what did he bang you with ? 
a hammer ? 
a play hammer or a police hammer ? 
a police hammer ? 
did it hurt you ? 
did you tell Missus_Platford why you were crying ? 
oh well . 
unless you tell people why she won't be able to do anything about it . 
but this is why I tell you you mustn't hit people . 
because it hurts and upsets people and then they won't wanna be your friend . 
because now [/] now you're saying you don't like James . 
and that's why „ isn't it ? 
and you don't want people to say “oh I don't like Thomas_Henry because he hit me over the head” „ do you ? 
you spit at people ? 
oh that's not nice „ is it ? 
is that what you did to James when he hit you ? 
oh right . 
because you told me about this . 
he doesn't understand +/. [+ IN] 
you did what ? 
oh , Thomas . 
you didn't knock him on the road and a bus ran over his bottom . 
you [<] [/] you mustn't get into fights with little friends .

what are the other little boys called ? 
Sarah ? 
that little girl ?

is she nice . 
she banged you on the head as well ? 
did she ? 
oh dear . 
is there anyone there that didn't bang you on the head ? 
no ? 
I don't think Missus_Platford banged you on the head „ did she ? 
and what about Emma ? 
Emma pushed you ? 
ever ? 
oh . 
you're getting confused now with you're the best boy ever in the whole wide world . 
<now Emma> [//] there's a little girl there called Emma and you were talking about Emma . 
was Emma nice to you ? 
pardon ? 
Thomas , why do you put your spoon up your sleeve ? 
you want Cornflakes ? 
okay . 
right . 
get that spoon out . 
don't be silly . 
you daft bat . 
right . 
there you are . 
Cornflakes . 
you want Mummy's Cornflakes instead ? 
would you like another drink of juice ? 
alright . 
would you like some milk on them , Thomas [>] ? 
no thank you ? 
is that what you wanted ? 
Cornflakes ? 
well Mummy wants Cornflakes as well . 
so shall I put these back <in the &d> [//] in the bowl ? 
have you got a bit fed up with these now ? 
mm . 
did you have a nice night's sleep last night ? 
you very tired when you went to bed ? 
Mummy cleaned the fridge last night . 
because it was dirty . 
and a lot of things needed sorting out . 
and when I cleaned it I caught the button that works the temperature . 
the thing in the fridge that makes it feel very cold . 
Mummy knocked the switch . 
this one here . 
I touched it when I was cleaning . 
and when I got up this morning the fridge was turned off . 
but we checked and everything still seems frozen in the freezer this morning . 
just checked the ice cream „ haven't we ? 
that happened the other day actually „ didn't it ? 
I think sometimes when the fridge is very full we put a lot of things in it +/. [+ IN] 
<and that> [<] [/] and that knocks the button as well . 
you know the when the fridge is really [/] really full like Christmas and your Birthday_Party . 
because it happened the other day „ didn't it ? 
the fridge had been turned off . 
and I know it's not you going in because we've got a lock on the fridge „ haven't we ? 
well to stop people going in . 
and stealing my milk and cheese . 
do you remember the day , Thomas , that we went to Sonia and Isabelle's house for a book party ? 
and Sonia's friend was selling a lot of books ? 
<a little> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
mhm . 
Daddy_Rod's house . 
yes . 
and Reardon was there with yourself and Jake_Kelly . 
and Reardon got into Sonia's fridge and emptied it „ didn't he ? 
and Sonia wasn't very pleased „ was she ? 
well because all her food was all over the floor . 
Reardon's Mummy was too busy reading the books and nobody noticed . 
and Jake_Kelly was helping „ wasn't he ? 
pardon ? 
crash ? 
you just dropped your spoon ? 
you alright , flower ? 
oh yes . 
you're wearing your bib and it says flowers grow in my garden . 
I thought you were a flower . 
you're a buzzy bee „ are you ? 
you going to land on the flowers ? 
oh . 
sting ? 
oh you stung me ? 
oh poor Mummy . 
oh poor Mummy . 
that's not at all nice „ is it ? 
mhm . 
Mummy's very tired this morning , Thomas . 
do you know what I'd really like to do ? 
go to sleep . 
I'd like to go back to bed +/. [+ IN] 
and go to sleep . 
and I've got a nice cup of tea here . 
so I'd like to finish my cup of tea and go back upstairs . 
would you like to come as well ? 
would you ? 
drink of coffee ? 
you'd like a drink of coffee first „ would you ? 
and then what would we do ? 
read some books ? 
story books ? 
and would we have a cuddle ? 
and then what ? 
we close our eyes . 
and snore . 
that's right . 
we go to sleep . 
shall we take Purdie with us ? 
because Purdie (h)as got her little bed at the side of Mummy's bed „ hasn't she ? 
near the radiator . 
Purdie (h)as got a bed near the radiator and window . 
everything she needs . 
so she can have a sleep and then jump into the window and have a little play outside . 
and we could all have a sleep „ couldn't we ? 
do you think she would ? 
that would wake us up „ wouldn't it ? 
we don't really want her to wake us up „ do we ? 
can you see her looking out of the window ? 
nothing's really happening this morning „ is it ? 
no lorrys to look at . 
no trucks . 
oh [<] Stephen (h)as just walked past . 
I don't know . 
<I think he (h)as> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
he's going home . 
pardon ? 
he's going home for his Mummy ? 
well Stephen's Liam's Daddy „ isn't he ? 
so I don't think he'll be going home to his Mummy . 
I think he's just gone back to his house . 
oh he's probably taking Liam to school . 
he (h)as probably walked Liam to school do you think ? 
because he takes him quite early „ doesn't he ? 
he takes him and Georgia . 
no it's very [/] very quiet outside . 
absolutely nothing's happening . 
yes . 
Linda and Brian are shuting their door . 
perhaps Linda's going to work . 
do you think it's time for her to go to work ? 
right . 
I'm putting some toast in the machine now , Thomas . 
okay ? 
mm mm ? 
what would you like on your toast this morning ? 
orange jam ? 
you mean marmalade ? 
orange marmalade ? 
yes . 
we quite like that „ don't we ? 
and would you like a few grapes ? 
yes please ? 
I'll wash some grapes . 
and peel them ? 
I don't think we needta peel them . 
we did when you were a baby but you're not a baby anymore . 
they say they're seedless so we don't hafta take any seeds out . 
did you enjoy those Cornflakes ? 
Ben and Charlotte come back from holiday today . 
pardon ? 
sorry I had the water running . 
I couldn't tell what you said . 
their car ? 
well they've been to Greece on an aeroplane „ haven't they ? 
they left their car at home . 
I would imagine they're coming home in a taxi . 
so I don't think we'll see them today . 
I don't know what time they get home . 
but I would doubt we'll see them at all today . 
perhaps we'll see them on Thursday . 
tomorrow . 
mind you tomorrow , Thomas , Jeannine's +//. [+ IN] 
oops that's the toast . 
Jeannine's coming tomorrow morning . 
pardon ? 
no . 
not now . 
in the morning . 
tomorrow morning . 
you thought she was coming now ? 
no . 
and (.) then <in the afternoon> [//] Thursday afternoon you're going to nursery again . 
pardon , love ? 
Mummy (h)as gone ? 
well you always know I'm coming back , Thomas „ don't you ? 
you always know Mummy's coming back for you , poppet . 
there you are . 
there's your grapes . 
now I'll get us some toast to eat . 
thing is though when you're at nursery , Thomas . 
Mummy's doing all sorts of jobs at home . 
like vacuuming and ironing . 
cleaning and you don't like it when Mummy does those jobs . 
you like it when Mummy's at home playing with you and talking to you „ don't you ? 
so it makes sense if Mummy can have a couple of hours on her own doing jobs you don't like . 
while you're playing with the other children and doing some painting and all the other things you do . 
isn't it ? 
and then when we come back together you can tell me all about it „ can't you ? 
what a good time you've had . 
Mummy will always come back for you , Thomas . 
I'm not leaving you there . 
we left your bag there „ didn't we ? 
last weekend . 
but that was a mistake . 
and we went back to get that . 
we didn't even leave your bag „ did we ? 
so there's no way I'm going to leave you . 
is that what upsets you ? 
that you think Mummy's leaving you ? 
I'm not leaving you at all , love . 
just for a few minutes . 
just for the afternoon „ isn't it ? 
those grapes nice , Thomas ? 
nice and sweet ? 
is Ginger here ? 
where ? 
oh hello , Ginger . 
well this is Purdie's food from last night . 
it's just a little bit (.) that she didn't eat . 
so I think Ginger can have some of that „ can't he ? 
yes . 
Purdie's scared of Ginger „ isn't she ? 
there we are . 
I've saved that little bit of food (.) for him . 
Purdie wouldn't eat it anyway . 
here you are , Puss . 
he doesn't look as if he (h)as got paint on his body anymore . 
perhaps got a faint mark . 
but it (h)as gone „ hasn't it ? 
there we are . 
just rinse my hands . 
and Purdie's a fussy pussy and she won't eat (.) the food that (h)as been left over from the night before „ will she ? 
and she always leaves something on the plate . 
xxx . 
pardon , darling ? 
you've got Cornflakes down your arm ? 
how have you got Cornflakes down you arm ? 
let me +//. [+ IN] 
oh dear . 
how have you done that ? 
have you been pushing Cornflakes up your sleeve ? 
you dafty lad . 
what are you ?

you <dafty dafty> [/] dafty . 
aren't you ? 
you done now ? 
never mind . 
we'll find them later . 
you're getting dressed in a few minutes „ aren't you ? 
right . 
I've just filled the washing up bowl up with water ready to wash the pots up after breakfast . 
you would like orange marmalade on this . 
sounds like proper toast that „ doesn't it ? 
crunchy crispy . 
marmalade . 
that's right . 
orange marmalade . 
which plate would you like to eat your toast and marmalade ? 
Winnie_the_Pooh again ? 
Bob_the_Builder . 
we haven't got a plate with tractors on „ have we ? 
no . 
how about the Teletubbies ? 
shall I choose one ? 
there we are . 
that's the Winnie_the_Pooh one . 
now you've got a matching set today „ haven't you ? 
well that's the one you've got . 
no . 
have the Winnie_the_Pooh one now , love , because I've just put the toast on . 
or I tell you what . 
I'll do some toast and Marmalade <and put it on> [>] +... [+ IN] 
has he gone in the grass ? 
oh yes . 
he's having a little sniff around „ isn't he ? 
can you see his tail ? 
it's all different shades of ginger . 
it's a very pretty tail „ isn't it ? 
mind you he's a boy so I shouldn't call him pretty . 
but he is quite pretty . 
<isn't Ginger> [>] ? 
what (h)as he got ? 
nice +... [+ IN] 
a nice nose ? 
has he ? 
nice to see you nose . 
would you like a little bit more drink ? 
do you wanna wash and go ? 
do you wanna sit on your potty for a few minutes ? 
to watch the television ? 
there you are . 
nice Teletubby plate for you . 
and I'll have the Winnie_the_Pooh plate . 
how does that sound ? 
do you not want it , Thomas ? 
you've just had Cornflakes and grapes . 
you not going to be hungry later on ? 
what about <this apple> [>] ? 
well I'll give you some more to drink because you haven't really had very much „ have you ? 
Thursday ? 
oh I thought you said you were thirsty . 
can you say the days of the week ? 
but there's xxx [>] . [+ PI] 
Monday Tuesday Wednesday +... [+ IN] 
so you've suddenly gone from telling me the days of the week to counting ? 
you did pretty well with the days of the week „ didn't you ? 
can you remember what we do on seven days of the week , Thomas ? 
wind the bobbin up ?

you wanna get down and watch Michael ? 
well Michael won't be on till a little bit later , Thomas . 
children's programmes don't start till later on in the day „ do they ? 
<what will> [>] +... [+ IN] 
what [>] were we saying about poor Michael the other day ? 
we were saying he seems to be on the television an awful lot „ doesn't he ? 
he works a long time . 
actually , Thomas , do you know what I think he does ? 
when [/] when you've got CBBC on choice they tend to repeat the same program . 
if you've watched Teletubbies in the morning then it's on again in the afternoon . 
it's exactly the same program „ isn't it ? 
so I think he's not there quite as long as it seems . 
I would imagine (.) that he's only there a short while during the day . 
and they just keep repeating it . 
but having said that (.) he shows different cards in_between each program „ doesn't he ? 
so I think (.) &-uh (.) he might be there for a fair while in the morning . 
thirsty . 
you're thirsty „ are you ? 
nothing to drink ? 
well I'm going to have this toast because I'm hungry . 
is that alright ? 
hm: [=! laughs] . 
does that taste good ? 
you've not had blackcurrant juice for a while „ have you ? 
we've been drinking orange . 
be careful , love . 
who else is on your Winnie_the_Pooh mug ?

can you see any ?

I can't . 
what about butterflys ? 
I've got Winnie_the_Pooh and Piglet . 
and there are butterflys and leaves but I can't see any bees .

you want me to turn the television on and watch Michael ? 
in a minute , Thomas . 
what we'll do we'll have a little wash . 
a big wash ? 
alright . 
and you can sit on your potty and we'll turn the television on . 
but we won't have the sound on . 
we'll just have a look at what's on and we can talk about it . 
but if we have the sound on full I can't tell what you're saying . 
you want the sound on you don't want me talking ? 
oh dear . 
do you not like hearing what I've got to say ? 
oh that's not nice „ is it ? 
oh who's that ? 
the who ? 
the policeman ?

the postman ? 
is that what you're trying to say ?

I hope not . 
we can do without the policemen and the firemen here this morning . 
that's all we need „ isn't it ? 
do you think it's going to rain ? 
it (h)as gone really dark „ hasn't it ? 
oh dear . 
I could do without it raining , Thomas . 
<do you> [<] remember a few weeks ago +//. [+ IN] 
or last week even . 
it was nice and hot „ wasn't it ? 
and we had our meals outside . 
and do you remember the day we stopped in Didsbury for an ice cream ? 
what do you mean nothing happened ? 
then it started to rain ? 
is it raining now ? 
I wouldn't be surprised . 
it (h)as gone very dark . 
I wanted to have a look at your little lego trains and things , Thomas . 
did I wash your hands ? 
I did „ didn't I ? 
I don't think I dried them with a towel . 
I don't feel as if I've done a proper job today .

when we go upstairs later you can have your teeth brushed .

how does that sound ?

perhaps you'll get sweeties later . 
do Nana and Granddad give you sweeties ? 
do they say you've been a good boy and give you sweeties ?

they've probably stopped doing it now . 
we haven't been to Macdonalds for a while . 
we went just before your birthday <and then we went the day after Mummy's birthday> [>] . 
I don't think Winnie_the_Pooh ever did go boing boing „ did he ? 
it's the kangaroo that goes boing !

this little on his hat lights up .

I'd be surprised if Winnie doesn't do anything .

Piglet is a very small animal . [+ R] 
he does not like having a bath . [+ R] 
do you remember the story book we've got about the pig that doesn't like having a bath ? 
what's [<] he called ? 
Scruffy pig ?

he gets in the shower and he keeps the umbrella up „ doesn't he ? 
so the water doesn't hit him . 
Piglet is a very small animal . [+ R] 
he does not like having a bath . [+ R] 
one day Piglet and his friends Pooh and Rabbit meet Kanga and Baby_Roo . [+ R] 
right .

this is Kanga . 
here we are . 
right . 
we've had a story about Winnie_the_Pooh . 
we've had a story about Eeyore . 
<there's Winnie> [<] . 
<there's Eeyore> [<] . 
we haven't got a piglet so we can't &-um (.) we can't put a Piglet in the line . 
but we can put Kanga there „ can't we ? 
one day Piglet and his friends Pooh and Rabbit meet Kanga and Baby_Roo . [+ R]

Piglet and Pooh help Rabbit make a plan . [+ R] 
Rabbit wants Piglet to pretend to be Baby_Roo . [+ R] 
when Kanga finds Piglet in her pocket she decides to give him a bath . [+ R] 
she scrubs him firmly . [+ R] 
she rubs him dry . [+ R] 
poor Piglet doesn't wanna be clean . [+ R] 
he gets all dirty again . [+ R] 
do you remember on the first page (.) Winnie_the_Pooh was rolling „ wasn't he ? 
it says Pooh was rolling in the mud until he was black all over . 
and on this one we've got Piglet that doesn't wanna be clean . 
so he gets dirty . 
don't you think that was funny ? 
don't you think that was funny ? 
that they pretend Piglet is the baby kangaroo and put him in his Mummy's pouch ? 
so she thinks it's her baby and she gives him a bath . 
but poor Piglet wasn't very pleased . 
right . 
now this is a story about Kanga and Baby_Roo . 
Kanga is Baby_Roo's mother . [+ R] 
she carries Roo in her pocket . [+ R] 
it's called a pouch .

one morning Rabbit wakes up early . [+ R] 
he thinks he will go and visit a friend . [+ R] 
he knocks at Christopher_Robin's door . [+ R] 
hello it's Rabbit he calls . [+ R] 
Christoper_Robin is not there . [+ R] 
Rabbit sees a piece of paper on the ground . [+ R] 
it is a message from Christopher_Robin . [+ R] 
gone out . [+ R] 
back soon . [+ R]

if you grow up to write like this at school your teachers will say “oh Thomas_Henry” . 
gone out .

busy . 
that's spelt wrong .
