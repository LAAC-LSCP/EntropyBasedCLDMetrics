he's coming . 
yes . 
he's coming . 
but we can't see him yet „ can we ? 
a truck a@p gate . 
oh is that because this morning when we were watching the road sweeper +/. [+ IN] 
+, I said to you go to the gate to have a look . [+ IN] 
yes . 
is that the noise that the machine makes ? 
can you see that little girl over there ? 
is she with her Mummy ? 
she's carrying a bag „ isn't she ? 
can you hear the machine ? 
why is it coming ? 
to pick up the rubbish . 
a blue one . 
what's a blue one ? 
a black one . 
a black bin bag . 
that's what you mean „ isn't it ? 
all about bin liners . 
they're waiting to be collected . 
yes . 
look at that mess . 
you've just thrown your beanbag on the floor . 
yes . 
well if you throw it on the floor . 
has it made a bang ? 
are you pretending to throw a bin bag ? 
I think you're throwing your beanbag pretending it's one of the bin bags „ aren't you ? 
it's a very sunny day „ isn't it ? 
are you shouting to the truck ? 
he'll be coming soon „ won't he ? 
down a@p Sue's house . 
down at this house . 
we've had an exciting day „ haven't we ? 
because this morning you saw that green lorry that comes everyday (.) stop outside . 
you watched the man make some deliverys to the house over there . 
and then he got back in his lorry and drove off . 
and then shortly after that the road sweeper came „ didn't he ? 
do you remember watching that lorry ? 
it went up and down that road . 
yes . 
that's the noise he was making . 
and now it's the refuse lorry's turn . 
three big trucks . 
yes . 
what was the truck doing ? 
I don't know . 
are you watching for him ? 
no . 
here it is . 
I can't see it . 
and the men haven't been yet to gather the bin bags up together „ have they ? 
what's Purdie ? 
I don't know . 
I haven't seen her . 
would you like a drink of milk while you're waiting ? 
no . 
are you watching the big truck ? 
well you can drink milk while you're waiting . 
would you like Mummy to bring it to you ? 
okay . 
there's a white car . 
a white car coming . 
it's not the big truck . 
it's a white car . 
oh you've missed it . 
you were too slow getting up to the window . 
you missed it . 
it (h)as all gone . 
it's a little boy wearing a hat . 
walking past . 
Thomas's hat . 
have you got a hat ? 
and there's some more people walking past . 
look . 
a lady and a little boy . 
I thought school had finished but it can't have done because they're in their school uniform „ aren't they ? 
they're in their school uniform and it's time for the school to finish . 
but they must still be at school today . 
is Thomas going to school soon ? 
there's some more children look . 
they're definitely at school „ aren't they ? 
yes . 
the lady's wearing a hat „ isn't she ? 
and the boy (h)as got a hat but the little girl hasn't „ has she ? 
they're running away . 
they're running towards their front door „ aren't they ? 
they've put the key in . 
and they'll be inside in a moment „ won't they ? 
are they going to shut the door ? 
they're not in yet „ are they ? 
shut . 
that's right . 
they've closed the door now „ haven't they ? 
it doesn't seem many weeks since we were watching the same children coming home (.) and they all had hats on because it was cold and wet . 
and now they've got hats on because it's sunny and warm . 
we've got to keep hats on in this sun to keep your head cool . 
are you still waiting for the truck ? 
oh there are the men . 
look . 
collecting the bin bags . 
what color's the man's trousers ? 
no . 
what color are the man's trousers ? 
all the men are wearing the same color . 
look . 
no . 
what is it ? 
they're all wearing green „ aren't they ? 
it's a bit silly really , Thomas . 
because the road sweeper came this morning . 
and swept all the sides of the road and now the bin bags will probably make a mess . 
and there will be mess again on the roads . 
yes . 
there's a man . 
are you going to wave to the man ? 
yes . 
hello . 
hello . 
yes . 
yes . 
you tell him . 
say thank you . 
oh_gosh we've done very well . 
he (h)as left us three bags , Thomas . 
three bags . 
he's only sposta leave us one . 
I think he must have thought we were watching to ask for more bags . 
three bin bags and three men working „ aren't there ? 
is that what he's doing ? 
you've taken your socks off young man . 
has Thomas taken his shoes and socks off ? 
that man's taking bin bags now to the house where the children went through the door . 
I bet they don't get three bin bags , Thomas . 
where's the truck ? 
I don't know . 
no . 
there's no truck and no &lor [//] lorry is there ? 
Mummy couldn't say lorry then . 
can you say lorry ? 
a white one lorry . 
he's leaving Sue a bin bag now . 
where did he put Sue's bin bag ? 
on the door . 
that's right . 
oh we've got a long wait today , Thomas . 
haven't we ? 
you're very tired „ aren't you ? 
<is it the sun making you sleepy> [//] is the sun making Thomas sleepy ? 
I think it's your busy day yesterday <as well> [>] . 
are you sore ? 
where are you sore ? 
<where are you sore , darling> [//] where are you sore ? 
show . 
Mummy . 
sore head . 
have you got a sore head ? 
is it because you got very hot ? 
looking out of the window in the sun . 
oh the men have gone now . 
we're all waiting for the truck „ aren't we ? 
the men have gathered all the bin bags together . 
and they're just waiting for the truck to come along now to pick them all up . 
what are you doing ? 
jumping up and down on the chair . 
you had a busy day yesterday „ didn't you ? 
you went to a Christening . 
whose Christening was it ? 
well it was Georgia's Christening „ wasn't it ? 
Jake's her brother . 
and are you snoring because when we left Georgia was asleep in her pram „ wasn't she ? 
where have the men gone ? 
I think like us they're waiting for the truck , Thomas . 
can you hear the birds cheeping next door ? 
cheep^cheep@o . 
now what did we do after the Christening yesterday ? 
did we go to the park ? 
we're going to go to the park this evening „ aren't we ? 
after you've had your tea (.) we'll go to the park because it's a beautiful day . 
and you've been playing in the garden . 
but I think it's nice for you to go and watch other children playing „ isn't it ? 
we usually go to the playground and play on the swings in the park . 
that's right . 
on the rides . 
you can ride on the roundabout „ can't you ? 
on the slide . 
you like the slide there „ don't you ? 
because it's very big . 
an aeroplane now , Thomas . 
going off in the sky . 
can you see it ? 
going over that house . 
no . 
it's not a helicopter . 
it's an aeroplane . 
it's a very big one . 
it's a very big one though . 
it's going very slowly . 
oh look . 
now quickly . 
oh quick . 
don't miss it now after all this waiting . 
oh it's the man driving the truck that's getting out to lift up all the bin bags . 
are you going to wave ? 
has it got big steps on it ? 
the men are all wearing green and the [/] the truck's white and green „ isn't it ? 
back a@p lorry . 
he's getting back inside the cab „ isn't he ? 
he'll just drive a little bit further along to pick up some more bags . 
can you see the orange flashing light on top of the lorry ? 
yes . 
is he going back in the lorry ? 
bye bye .

yes . 
they've all those bags to pick up outside of that house „ haven't they ? 
they've got lights flashing on the back as well , Thomas .

can you see those lights flashing at the top ? 
just be careful where you're climbing . 
can you see them ? 
orange lights flashing . 
yellow one . 
yes . 
they're orange „ aren't they ? 
watching window . 
are you watching through the window ? 
bye bye . 
that's right . 
a drop more . 
he's stopping outside of Sue's door now „ isn't he ? 
to pick up rubbish outside of her house . 
no . 
be careful of the window . 
when he (h)as gone now we won't be able to see him until next week „ will we ? 
he's going . 
he's going now . 
we'll see him next week . 
next Monday we'll see him . 
all gone .

yes . 
you've been watching a big truck „ haven't you ? 
are you going to have a drink of milk now ? 
ooh because it's thirsty work watching a big truck „ isn't it ?

don't go to sleep „ will you ? 
you look like you might go to sleep . 
just let Mummy go and do something , sweetheart . 
and then you can come back and sit on my knee . 
just one moment . 
oh that's Fred . 
are you telling him you're watching ? 
watch a@p machine . 
yes . 
the big machine (h)as gone now . 
it's Fred and Rachel coming home „ isn't it ? 
are you saying hello to them ? 
I think we'll hafta cut your nails later on , Thomas . 
your toenails . 
yes . 
you can cut your toe nails <as well> [>] . 
and your fingernails . 
yes . 
it was your fingernails I was meaning but we can cut your toenails as well . 
shall we wait until after your bath tonight ? 
what's this coming ? 
I don't know . 
is he unloading his car ? 
is he taking something out of the car ? 
what can you see ? 
it's a bag . 
do you wanna go back outside ? 
you want your wellies on . 
well I was going to put your sandals on . 
yes . 
I was . 
shall we start rolling up these bin bags ? 
that's right . 
it's the bags that the men in the big truck left us . 
are you helping Mummy to fold them ? 
you're putting them in a chair „ are you ? 
that's very helpful . 
one more . 
a drop more . 
and if I fold them up nicely like this , Thomas . 
I can store them in the cupboard „ can't I ? 
if we screw them up like you've just screwed them up they're not going to fit in very well „ are they ? 
would you like to pass me the other one please . 
would you like to pass the bin bag from the chair ? 
oops a daisy . 
we've dropped it . 
we dropped it . 
is that your octopus ? 
what's on the octopus , Thomas ? 
pictures of fish . 
right . 
is this the last one now we've got to fold up ? 
there we are . 
you go and put them in the cupboard now . 
in the cupboard . 
let Mummy show you where she keeps them . 
oh look . 
Purdie's at the door . 
look then , Thomas . 
I keep them up here (.) in the cupboard . 
so if ever you need a bin bag you know where they are . 
shall we let Purdie in now ? 
she (h)as gone away again . 
she was at the door „ wasn't she ? 
did you do something at the door to make her go away ? 
yes . 
what did you do ? 
I've just realized you're wearing green shorts like the binmen „ aren't you ? 
they had long trousers on . 
you've got short ones on . 
but they're all green . 
you've got a white t+shirt on . 
change . 
yes . 
I think we needta change you „ don't you ? 
Bow@c a@p change . 
you wanna change a pussy cat as well . 
oh . 
I'm not sure how we're going to change the cat . 
what is it ? 
is it a bee ? 
I don't think you'll remember that . 
but last year when Daddy's Uncle_Tony came to visit in the Summer he bought that for you . 
but it's a mobile . 
it's not something you can really play with . 
so (.) we had it hanging upstairs for awhile . 
and then I put it in the cupboard but I found it again . 
would you like to bring that one ? 
right . 
what is it ? 
shall we unpack it ? 
it's bees . 
it's a lot of bees on a mobile . 
they're knitted „ aren't they ? 
with black and yellow wool . 
but I don't think last summer you knew what a bee was . 
do you know a rhyme about a bee ? 
are you doing the actions ? 
buzzz@o . 
is that what a bee does ? 
buzz@o [/] buzz@o [/] buzz@o [/] buzz@o . 
but one of the bees has fallen off „ hasn't he ? 
where do you think this bee belongs ? 
on there . 
what about on that one ? 
no . 
well I think it does . 
I think it belongs there . 
so if we thread it on to that one . 
back outside . 
well in a little while you can go back outside . 
look . 
there's a big bee there . 
that's called the queen bee . 
the big one at the top . 
and then there are one two three four five six other bees dangling down . 
up and down . 
up and down . 
what do you think the bee is saying ? 
bang^a^drum^time@c .
