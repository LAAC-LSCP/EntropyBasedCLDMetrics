have it in this beaker this morning . 
now I've got two jobs to do today . 
we've got to hand some washing out . 
well alright . 
we've got <three jobs> [//] four jobs then . 
I've got to do some (.) work in the house . 
we've got to play . 
there you are . 
we've got to peg some washing out . 
while the weather's nice . 
and we must remember to put the rubbish out . 
for the dustmen . 
must have a lie out there ? 
pardon ? 
xxx . 
<is lying> [/] is lying down one of the jobs ? 
I see . 
it actually looks a little bit dull at the front then „ doesn't it ? 
yeah it looks nice at the back . 
luckily that's where the washing line is . 
oh we're eating our breakfast nicely . 
going to be some crunching and chumping „ isn't there ? 
0 [=! chuckles] . 
I'm just laughing because you've got your lego train on the table . 
look at the train driver . 
actually I think he's a [/] a farmer really . 
from the tractor „ isn't he ? 
and he looks funny sitting on top of the train . 
watching you eating your breakfast . 
is that the cab ? 
is that the way you built it ? 
I [<] notice he's got flashing lights at the front . 
like a police car . 
so what is he ? 
a goods train . [+ I] 
lights at the back at the bottom ? 
hm: . 
so why has he (.) got flashing lights ? 
to warn people that the goods train's coming . 
and it's a very (.) loud and long train ? 
one's noisy and one's quick . 
right . 
<noisy quick> [/] noisy quick [/] noisy quick . 
is that what it says as it goes along ? 
oh . 
mhm oh . 
that is fast . 
isn't it ? 
pardon ? 
luckily the goods are indoors . 
what do you mean ? 
inside the train ? 
and what sort of good does he carry ? 
fruit ? 
mhm . 
xxx [<] . 
is that xxx apples and pears ? [+ PI] 
does it ? 
ah is that why it's [//] he's a farmer train driver ? 
it's just that I thought you know fruit's grown in orchards . 
and farms . 
so I thought perhaps he'd brought his fruit . 
loaded it up in the train . 
and then driving it himself . 
so he is a farmer train driver ? 
no ? 
right . 
is that somebody working at the station ? 
xxx what ? [+ PI] 
not when it's got milk all over it . 
(be)cause if you get milk on the lego . 
I'll hafta wash it all . 
because milk will go really sour and horrible . 
no . 
you won't lick it off . 
you just don't put it on . 
I don't think either of us can talk properly . 
because we're both chomping away „ aren't we ? 
does it taste good ? 
no . 
Thomas . 
that's not how a train driver drinks . 
you've put your tongue in your beaker „ haven't you ? 
and you're trying to lap your juice up . 
but you know what'll happen . 
it'll end up getting spilt . 
and look at the table . 
what's on the table ? 
all [<] the ironing that Mummy did last night . 
all beautifully folded up ready to go in the drawers . 
(be)cause I couldn't come in last night . 
because you were asleep and Daddy was asleep . 
if I'd started putting clothes away in drawers . 
it would have woken you both up . 
so we don't want any spills this morning . 
because I haven't had a chance to move it . 
I wouldn't be very happy if I hadta rewash your xxx +//. [+ PI] [+ IN] 
in fact do you know why I hadta put the washing machine on this morning ? 
we've got some washing to peg out on the line later . 
(be)cause in the washing machine . 
I've got some things in that are in a [//] it's called prewash , Thomas . 
when [/] when things are very dirty . 
sometimes you put them in the washing machine . 
for what's called the prewash . 
with a little bit of powder . 
and it gives them a quick wash . 
and then lets them stand in water to soak . 
to soak stains away . 
and then when I drain that water . 
I'll put them in on a proper wash . 
can you guess what's in the washing machine ? 
what was stained ? 
pardon ? 
the pen jumper . 
that's right . 
you got pen or biro „ didn't you ? 
all over your shirt yesterday . 
then what happened to your vest ? 
you spilt something on it . 
was it Ribena ? 
you [<] ran outside in the wet . 
and your socks got muddy . 
you slipped on the grass . 
so your trousers were dirty . 
but then I didn't tell you this . 
last night after I'd done my ironing . 
because Daddy had put a couple of things on the video recorder . 
that I wanted to watch . 
so when you went to bed last night . 
I stood and I ironed all these clothes . 
and then when I finished ironing . 
I went up stairs . 
had a quick shower . 
got into my night dress . 
came down . 
put the second video on . 
well the second program I wanted to watch . 
sat down with a cup of coffee to relax . 
and guess what I did . 
dropped the coffee . 
it went all in the chair . 
and all over my nightie . 
so I ended up going back to have a quick shower again . 
and putting a clean night dress on . 
and then cleaning the chair . 
and guess where the night dress is . 
soaking with all your dirty things in the washing machine . 
&=laughs . 
no [<] . 
I don't think you will . 
so it's a good job really . 
because that prewash +/. [+ IN] 
no . 
you won't . 
no . 
it was a pen actually from church „ wasn't it ? 
that [<] you got . 
I think that you just suddenly appeared with three biros . 
in your pocket . 
whose pens were they ? 
who have you been pinching pens from ? 
hm: . 
seems a bit careless . 
that somebody's left three biros on the floor . 
two pens and one biro ? [+ I] 
well a biro is a pen . 
the blue one hm: . 
well yes . 
I noticed that your shirt had both black and blue marks on it . 
no . 
I told you not to get pen on your clothes , Thomas . 
<because it might not come out> [>] . 
well I knew it was all biro or pen . 
but no . 
that was your best shirt yesterday , Thomas . 
and you've only worn it once before yesterday . 
so I hope the marks come out . 
(be)cause if they don't +... [+ IN] 
no . 
there's no try and clean them , Tom . 
if they don't come out that's it . 
and when you next needta be smart somewhere . 
you'll hafta go in a shirt with biro all over . 
they'll all say [=! tuts] . 
silly_billy@wp boy . 
0 [=! giggles] . 
your xxx shirt tomorrow . [+ PI] 
hm: . 
I hope we don't find that . 
mind you Daddy sometimes puts biros in his shirt pockets . 
and he [/] he gets little bit of biro on his shirt . 
mucky you . 
yes dirty_berties@wp . 
I haven't seen Purdie covered in biro and I never wanna . 
don't ever try and draw on Purdie „ will you ? 
no . 
she's brushed up against paint before . 
you know when paint's wet ? 
you've seen people put up “caution wet paint” signs . 
or they [>] just say “wet paint do not touch” . 
Purdie can't read . 
I've forgotten where it was from . 
because I think we'd been doing some painting . 
not here . 
when [*] but the place that we lived at before here . 
I think we were really worried about Purdie . 
but nothing happened to her . 
then one of the neighbors must have been doing some painting . 
Purdie walked and [?] past and came in with paint all down her side . 
well not really because +... [+ IN] 
hm: well +... [+ IN] 
+, luckily with her being a long haired cat . 
I cut it off . 
xxx . 
you've not been sitting down a long time . 
you've just sat down . 
it'll be the way you're sitting . 
you mean it's stiff ? 
xxx [<] sore ? [+ PI] 
or is it just stuck to the chair ? 
because that [/] <that can> [>] be painful „ can't it ? 
when you stick to the chair . 
well no . 
the [/] the problem is with pussy cat . 
she can [//] cat [/] cats clean themselves . 
yeah [?] [>] . 
so if you're covered in paint . 
and you lick it off . 
what's going to happen ? 
the paint's going to go in your mouth . 
and paint is poisonous . 
so I hadta stop her licking it off . 
a lot of paint doesn't just wash off . 
although actually I think this did . 
so (.) what I did . 
<we got> [//] we held her down . 
got scissors and cut off as much as we could . 
and then we bathed her . 
which she didn't like . 
but [?] [<] at least it stopped her from licking the paint . 
I think if a cat's very [/] very badly covered in paint . 
you know if say a paint pot falls on their head or something . 
I think you hafta go to the vets really . 
to get them sorted out . 
unless it's a paint that you can just wash off in the shower . 
but cats don't like water . 
the trouble is because Purdie's old . 
if [>] we hadta give her a bath now . 
she'd probably get very upset . 
and that in itself might make her poorly . 
well no . 
it's okay to bath them . 
but they absolutely hate it . 
I have bathed her on several occasions . 
sometimes when she's come in very [/] very dirty . 
the thing is now . 
Thomas . 
stop it . 
no . 
she's (.) I know she's xxx elderly or olderly@c . [+ PI] 
what do you say ? 
well that's not a word . 
elderly is a word . 
and old is the word . 
no . 
well olderly@q (i)s your [/] your own little word . 
but it's quite cute . 
olderly@c . 
&-um (.) no . 
Purdie doesn't explore quite as much now „ does she ? 
oh I'm sure she still chases mice . 
I think she would . 
but the only thing is we haven't got mice round here . 
thank goodness . 
although again I'm sure we [/] we have mice . 
we have . 
because I've seen one in the sweet peas last year . 
definitely saw a mouse . 
in fact we've had one since then . 
but what I mean is . 
I haven't actually seen Purdie with a mouse but &-uh +... [+ IN] 
when you were a baby . 
one day Purdie had a mouse . 
out [//] just outside of this door . 
0 [=! gasps] . 
and I remember you were in your little rocker top thing . 
and I picked you up and put you on the table . 
and then I stood on the table . 
then I rang Linda next door . 
and I said “oh Purdie's got a mouse” . 
and she said “well I can't help you” . 
and Linda and I were talking to each other . 
through the patio door . 
because the conservatory wasn't built in those days . 
we were talking to each other through the patio door . 
and we were watching Purdie with this mouse . 
and eventually +... 
+, I managed to grab hold of Purdie . 
so that the mouse had time to run away from her . 
but it's not as +/. [+ IN] 
oh Purdie wasn't happy with me . 
but the thing is I don't like mice . 
but (.) it was a little field mouse . 
it wasn't as if it was in the house . 
and (.) Purdie's not a hungry animal . 
and the reason animals kill other animals is for food . 
to eat them . 
you know cats kill mice to eat them . 
but Purdie has loads of food . 
she doesn't needta kill a mouse to eat it . 
and it's not fair . 
poor little mouse . 
imagine how frightened it must have been . 
while she was tossing it in the air . 
and play [//] she was having fun . 
it was like Tom and Jerry . 
she thought it was great . 
chasing this poor little thing . 
so I held onto her . 
while the mouse ran away . 
and do you know what else she's had ? 
well she's had birds . 
I've seen her with birds . 
and frogs . 
we've got frogs in our garden . 
have you seen them ? 
you know where they are ? 
near your sand pit . 
that's right . 
you did the other week . 
hm: you would do . 
it was quite funny . 
because again when you were very young . 
we went to Nana and Grandad's . 
and <collected some pebbles> [>] . 
oh don't you like stories from when I was young . 
&=laughs . 
&=laughs . 
you just don't like the sound of my voice „ do you ? 
cheeky boy . 
you cheeky boy . 
oh no . 
don't do that . 
right . 
this is the last story now . 
then I'm keeping quiet and you talk the rest of the time . 
the rest of the day is yours [>] . 
right [<] . 
here we go again . 
<when you were a &b [//] when you were very young> [>] . 
<we went to the seaside> [>] . 
and we collected a pot of stones and pebbles . 
and oh you were very [/] very young . 
but you useta like sitting on the floor . 
just (.) messing about with these pebbles outside . 
and then of course the Summer went . 
and the pebbles were outside in a plastic container . 
and I think it rained and it rained in them . 
and I looked at the container and thought it was all dirty water . 
I thought “oh well I'll clean it up one day” . 
+" we don't need them now . 
the next time I looked we had a little family of frogs . 
that had sort of made a home in this box . 
with the water and the pebbles . 
so we left it and that's where they are . 
and the box is still there . 
the pebbles are still there . 
and the frogs are still there . 
did you know [*] that white butterfly [>] ? 
I [<] can just see a white butterfly . 
it's nice „ isn't it [>] ?

after tea we went to the local playground . 
oh don't do that , Thomas [>] . 
and there was a little (.) swing . 
with a proper baby seat on . 
not like the swing we've got now . 
a proper baby seat . 
and Nana and Grandad useta put you in there . 
and we useta push you very gently .

you'd say “<a do> [/] a do [/] a do” . 
Nana [<] and Grandad would take you to John_Lewis . 
and you useta like riding +//. [+ IN] 
well you still like doing this . 
going up the escalator right to the top . 
and then all the way down to the bottom . 
having a quick look in the toy store in the basement . 
and then back up to the top . 
and you'd get to the escalator . 
and go “<a do> [/] a do [/] a do” . 
<you wanted to do it again and again> [<] . 
<we gave> [<] . 
we gave you a chocolate mousse one day .

you've seen babies „ haven't you ? 
just start to walk and then what happens ? 
fall over . [+ I] 
so all the time you've got to watch them and help them .

I'm going back to the really olden days now . 
when <I was a little girl> [>] . 
one of the things that I useta like , Thomas . 
some of my friends had a big garden . 
and their Daddy useta have a water sprinkler in the middle of the lawn . 
and on a hot day he would turn it on really fast . 
and we useta put our swimming costumes on . 
and we'd run through it . 
and it was lovely .

are you trying to do a knot with the hose pipe ? 
pretending it's the anchor . 
tying it round the swing . 
that's good . 
well <not quite> [>] . 
yes that sounds right . 
that's right actually , Thomas . 
no that's a different noise now . 
it's nearly . 
if you'd have pulled the other end that would have been a knot . 
what noise do you think that is now ? 
somebody cutting the grass ? 
oh yes . 
if it was a plane it would be a big one „ wouldn't it ? 
it sounds a lot closer than a plane . 
that's right . 
put it through there . 
and then pull the end tight . 
you needta do it nearer the top I think .

I'm sure it's fine .

we've got somebody cutting the grass . 
Uncle_Brian is outside banging in the garden . 
lots_of jumbo jets and lots_of noise . 
so I think really we'll hafta come in . 
and apart from that I don't think other people will be very happy . 
if they thought what they were saying was being taped „ do you ? 
I think we've got to be a bit careful . 
it's alright you and I talking . 
but you know you don't &-um want other people's conversations . 
because they wouldn't be very pleased „ would they ? 
if that was on tape .
