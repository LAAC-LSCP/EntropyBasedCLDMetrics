not slicing it . 
you would like it sliced ? 
sliced . 
okay . 
oh that's what Daddy puts in the light bulb when we go away .

the water dropping . 
we've got a big bag of rubbish there from beneath the stairs „ haven't we ? 
eat some sandwiches as well , darling . 
otherwise you'll be hungry .

Mummy was cross . 
that's why I said put all these toys away . 
I like you playing with your toys .

when you've finished playing with something you should put it away . 
you've had a nice time while you've been playing with them „ haven't you ?
