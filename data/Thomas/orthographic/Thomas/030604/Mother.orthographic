do you know what a cellar is , Thomas ? 
apart from somebody who sells things . 
it's the bottom part of a house .

oh this is a good idea this „ isn't it ? 
it's just like toast . 
when you say a seller^man@c (.) what do you mean ? 
somebody who sells things or you wanna go in the cellar . 
you're pretending your box is a cellar ? 
you're having a lot of fun with that box „ aren't you ? 
look . 
what are all these cards doing on the floor , Thomas ? 
was it ? 
listen . 
if you're posting them through that box you must be careful , Thomas . 
they're not to be ripped up these . 
they're not like the old envelopes that you play with when you're doing your posting . 
these are special cards . 
it's a nurse . 
do you know what these people are ? 
no . 
don't do that with them , Thomas .

this is the counter .

not now . 
in a few minutes you can when we've sorted out the stock . 
well I need some help , Thomas .

and this is the shop selling other things . 
the letters and the numbers . 
does it sell tape recorders ? 
goodness me . 
well it better go on the road „ hadn't it ?

you know the one that seems to have some traffic lights on the counter as well ? 
it (h)as got that many things in the shop you can hardly [>] . 
no .

hello . 
how are you ? 
do you mean how much is it ? 
I think it'll be about twenty pounds that , Thomas .

does that mean I can have it back because you haven't got twenty pounds ? 
ah right . 
okay . 
is there something else in the shop that you'd like ? 
yes . 
of course you can . 
yes . 
that would be beautiful to put across +//. [+ N]

you'd like to sit on my knee . 
of course you can . 
but I'm not quite sure whether you're a train driver or a lorry driver because +/. [+ N] 
ah but what I don't understand . 
I thought you were a lorry driver because you kept driving a big lorry up to my shop but what I don't understand is if you're a lorry driver why do you keep going to the train station ? 
is that where you park your lorry ? 
I see . 
I see .

goodness me . 
which road was this , Thomas ? 
that you were walking down . 
you were on Burnage_Lane . 
a wheelbarrow with lots_of wheels . 
oh dear dear . 
oh dear . 
well I think the lady you're talking about , Thomas . 
it wasn't actually a wheelbarrow . 
it's called a shopping trolley . 
but it's not like a supermarket shopping trolley . 
it's a shopping trolley that you see a lot of ladys pushing . 
and they're often tartan . 
they're often check „ aren't they ? 
and they're on two wheels . 
and they have a little handle . 
and she was pulling it along or pushing it along . 
I can't remember what she was doing now . 
and we were following her „ weren't we ? 
we were walking down School_Lane and she was walking down School_Lane . 
and where were we going ? 
to the park . 
all of a sudden the wheel fell off her trolley . 
and she fell down „ didn't she ? 
and what happened to her shopping ? 
oh dear . 
her shopping fell as she fell . 
she hurt herself „ didn't she ? 
no , Thomas .

she didn't have a nice soft landing like you just had then „ did she ? 
it was blood not paint . 
yes .

she hurt her head „ didn't she ? 
and her knee . 
and she was a bit upset . 
you were holding her hand to help her cross the road . 
you were holding her sleeve . 
were you ? 
yes [<] . 
okay . 
I shall +/. [+ IN] 
alright . 
well I shall look after your saw and your truck while your gone . 
good . 
that's Daddy's umbrella . 
what are you doing with Daddy's umbrella ? 
saw not sword . 
saw . 
as in see saw . 
oh no . 
well if a train had crashed I would hope there would be some flashing nee_nas@c coming along soon . 
yes . 
Thomas , who are you now ? 
are you still the train driver ? 
you're a train^accident^lorry@c „ are you ? 
you're not a fireman or a policeman or a ambulance man . 
oh dear . 
it looks like the train (h)as come off the rails to me . 
gosh . 
a ravine . 
that's a very big word . 
you said suddenly the driver switched the rails and went into a ravine . 
a ravine down below . 
is that something you've heard on Thomas_The_Tank_Engine ? 
you could do with Cranky_the_Crane to lift the train back on the rails „ couldn't you ? 
a fork lift truck . 
you're taking of the letters out of the carriages . 
oh dear . 
what do you want me to do , Thomas ? 
your bicycle is your train repair lorry . 
you want me to pull that one for help for the lorry ? 
do you not want me to ring for the ambulance or the police or the fire brigade ? 
nobody's what , darling ? 
you wanna borrow the box . 
that's fine . 
oh I see . 
have you got the box for these cards , Thomas . 
and then I could put them away if we're not looking at them now . 
do you know where the box is please ? 
has anybody been injured in this train crash , Thomas ? 
no . 
was it just an empty train ? 
can it ? 
my handbag can be your telephone „ can it ? 
right . 
okay . 
hello . 
well a train apparently has just crashed . 
I think you better come with your train repair lorry please . 
okay . 
do you think we needta call the police fire or ambulance ? 
the police . 
okay . 
I'll do that now then . 
you [/] you start coming on your way . 
and I'll ring for the police . 
thank you . 
bye bye . 
&=laughs . 
that was quick . 
gosh . 
that was quick „ wasn't it ? 
you were there in a flash . 
goodness me . 
they're all here „ are they ? 
are you ? 
be careful . 
I will . 
pardon . 
it doesn't matter if I borrow it . 
no . 
I'm only looking after it for you because you asked me to . 
that was quick . 
what have you done ? 
you've knocked the box over with Daddy's umbrella . 
what sort of rescue progress [//] &-uh process was that ? 
will that help the train that (h)as crashed , Thomas ? 
be careful . 
oh goodness me . 
what are knocking the barrier over with ? 
and why are you knocking the barrier over ? 
no . 
oh again . 
I thought we'd just got that all mended . 
I thought we'd sorted that out . 
pardon . 
Borshin . 
are you putting barriers around like a building site that (h)as been demolished ? 
to stop people getting hurt . 
pardon . 
bolished@c . 
do you mean abolished ? 
abolished . 
got rid off . 
no more . 
there are a lot of barriers . 
I don't think you should play with Daddy's umbrella , Thomas . 
I think you better put that back please . 
no . 
because if it gets broken Daddy'll be very cross . 
he needs that when it's a wet day . 
you mustn't start banging things with it please . 
because it will break . 
he's not „ is he ? 
he's not . 
but if he comes home and he sees you playing with his umbrella he's not going to be very happy „ is he ? 
are you sure there are no people on the train that are hurt ? 
what about the train driver ? 
is he hurt ? 
oh dear . 
well do you not think you better get the ambulance ? 
what's the problem , Sir ? 
did it ? 
oh I thought you'd been involved in the train crash . 
was it seeing the train crash that made you feel a bit funny ? 
made you feel a bit wobbly „ did it ? 
well I think the best thing is if you'd like to lie down . 
would you like [>] +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
would you like to come and sit on my knee ? 
is it ? 
is that the Doctor's surgery table ? 
the examination table .

and I'll have a little look . 
oh look at that big tummy .
