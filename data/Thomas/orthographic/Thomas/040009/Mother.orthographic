what's xxx +/? [+ PI] 
oh I see . 
well I think it's safe if it's only a reflection that's in my cup of tea . 
I thought you meant the bubbles needed rinsing . 
when I wash up I always rinse the pots before putting them on the drainer . 
I wash them in soapy water then I rinse them under the tap . 
then I leave them to drain or dry them straight away . 
and I never [/] never let . 
I always rinse my pots always rinse the teapot yet when I pour tea out of the pot (.) look . 
you get these tiny bubbles around the edge . 
they're gradually popping away though „ can you see ? 
just you watch this . 
watch it closely because it is xxx .[+ PI]

would you like Honeyloops ? 
yes okay . 
would you like some milk with them ? 
you know the cereal I like „ don't you ? 
oops they've just gone a bit sticky in the box <I'll just hafta shake them up> [>] . 
alright [<] this'll make a noise now . 
there I've given the box a shake up . 
right . 
don't pour too many please . 
you eat what you pour because if you don't pour very many you'll go hungry if you pour too many you'll be there till lunchtime eating . 
now I like these and but I'm going to have milk with them . 
huh ? 
I like milk on cornflakes but it's the only cereal I like milk with . 
I either have fruit juice yoghurt or I don't bother . 
but if we were going to have this it means we can't talk very well because we'll be too busy chomping [>] away .

I'm looking at it now and it's working . 
now I've got some nice fresh milk here for your cornflakes . 
thought you wanted milk . 
did you not . 
oh . 
I thought when I asked you before I said “would you like milk” you said yes@q . 
no . 
why don't you want milk ? 
come on , Thomas . 
just cause you split it [//] don't be silly you can have milk . 
well occasionally you spill your juice but it doesn't stop you having juice „ does it ? 
it doesn't . 
come on . 
well don't be worried about spilling . 
have some milk if you want some milk [>] . 
well milk's good for you Thomas . 
oh you are awkward . 
come on you can have milk . 
all you hafta do is just be careful when you're eating (.) „ don't you ? 
yes ? 
well I'm having some of this yoghurt because I think that needs using up . 
would you like some yoghurt ? 
no thank you ? 
you're a bit grumpy [>] . 
looks like xxx glue „ does it ? [+ PI] 
it's greek yoghurt it's quite thick „ isn't it ? 
it's <not a> [/] (.) not a pouring kind of yoghurt .

xxx . 
look xxx got yoghurts in the fridge cause we needta go shopping later . [+ PI] 
we haven't got many things in . 
will you remind me to buy some teabags as well please . 
we've always got spare teabags . 
in the top of that big cupboard there's a big tartan tin . 
do you know what I mean by tartan ? 
I'll show you . 
tartan is a fabric . 
or at least a pattern of a fabric . 
can you see that tin up there the checked one ? 
scottish people . 
you see men in kilts „ haven't you men in skirts ? 
or they're made of tartan , which is not a fabric it's sort of a thick woolly blend (.) made of wool . 
and it's different colored checks and crosses (.) stripes and things (.) and each family has a different tartan . 
her name's Anderson . 
and there's a tartan called the Anderson tartan . 
so whenever she gets a kilt (.) or anything tartan she always goes for a certain color . 
I don't think there's a Lastname tartan but pretend there was a Lastname tartan then we would go for a different tartan a different color . 
the other day when Grandad was here he said have you any more teabags and I said yes in the tartan tin . 
and he topped up the little pot by the kettle (.) with the teabags from the tartan tin but now the teapot [/] &-uh the pot near the kettle's nearly empty . 
so unless we've more in the tartan tin we needta buy more teabags . 
or we won't be able to have cups of tea in the morning . 
you don't mean that . 
<do you mean that> [?] ? 
right [<] . 
I don't mind drinking water but I couldn't drink that . 
I don't like particularly . 
I don't wanna be any bigger Thomas I could do with being a bit stronger .

you know the one I mean it's got twin beds in it two beds ? 
that's where Daddy useta sleep . 
well that's the bedroom that Nanna and Granddad have the exercise bicycle in . 
can't say I've seen it for a while could you ? 
is it not there now ? 
well they've either put it in the &-uh attic room or they've put it in the loft . 
because Nanna and Granddad have a big house „ don't they ? 
they have downstairs then they have the next floor with three bedrooms the bathroom . 
and then you go up some more steps and the entire top of the house +...

what color airport ? 
well what's tall ? 
can you not see Blackpool tower ? 
oh Thomas Henry you can . 
you know I thought that's why every time we go there we take you up there to have a look at the tower . 
it's in the distance but you can see it quite clearly especially at night when it's all lit up . 
and we only have a loft as well „ don't we ? 
yes . 
well the next time you go when it gets dark cause it gets darkish in the evening „ doesn't it when we're still there ?

I wish we had a house with so much room Thomas that would be nice . 
would you like a windmill ? 
a windmill you'd like to live in a windmill „ would you ? 
I don't think there'd be an awful lot of room in a windmill actually Thomas . 
<please will you eat properly and then you got upset about spilling milk this is why> [>] . 
your Nan and Granddad don't live in a windmill Thomas „ do they ? 
there's a windmill near where they live „ isn't there ? 
have you been to see that ? 
and was it +/? [+ IN] 
two windmills (.) right (.) have you been inside one them ? 
oh it's lovely inside . 
well I can't remember which one I've been in but there's one and when you go in they still grind corn to make flour . 
and you can go in and see all the men working . 
and they give you a show round it's lovely actually and that's one where you hafta go round a spiral staircase . 
it's <very nice> [>] . 
<no (.) I haven't> [<] . 
but when you're on the motorway I don't know whether it's coming back from Nanna and Granddad's or the whether it's the Lake district you can see it . 
you can see some houses a group of houses and there's a windmill there . 
and that is actually a house where somebody lives . 
<that's not> [//] that's near the motorway though . 
<do you know> [<] what it's like to live in a windmill it's like a xxx [>] ? 
<the dam's>[<] breaking . 
are you breaking up your hula hoops ? 
I've always thought that it would be strange to live in a lighthouse as well . 
to live in a lighthouse must be very strange . 
well the shape of a lighthouse [//] I mean to get to the top you'd hafta go +//. [+ N] 
I've been in a lighthouse at Scarborough . 
and there you hafta go <round and> [/] round and round as you're going up the steps . 
right to the top and it's very tall a lighthouse .

I don't think Purdie would like to live in a lighthouse because you know at the moment she just trots to the door „ doesn't she to be let out ? 
well the door of a lighthouse <what would be> [/] what would be there when you opened the door of a lighthouse ? 
sea . 
well lighthouses [>] are in the middle of seas „ aren't they ? 
<or usually at the> [>] edge of piers . 
xxx . 
no . 
I don't think Purdie can do cat paddle . 
I don't know what would happen if she got into water . 
I don't know whether they can swim or not . 
they don't like water cats . 
she doesn't even like getting wet in the rain „ does she Purdie ? 
no . 
she doesn't . 
hm mm . 
I have bathed her occasionally . 
I think we're doing more eating than talking „ aren't we ?

I don't mean break it up you see we might hafta do a little bit now at breakfast and we might hafta do some later . 
well I think sometimes , Thomas . 
we'll try and go have a look a that windmill . 
we'll ask Daddy because it was with Daddy that I went . 
and lighthouses I mean at one point you could go and visit lighthouses . 
when people lived in them but something's happened now and I can't think what it is . 
I don't know whether people don't live in them any more . 
you see the lighthouse keeper [//] it would have been very hard work I would imagine . 
saying that he [/] he shined lights to warn ships that they were coming near <the edge of the> [//] you know there were rocks and they were coming to the pier . 
and so I've a feeling now it's all done by computer . 
I don't think people hafta stay in lighthouses any more . 
mm . 
has there not been something on the Teletubbies or the Tweenies about lighthouses ? 
the Tweenies I seem to think I've seen something <what's that> [/] what's that program all about ? 
and so three ships come sailing in . 
that one ? 
well I don't think I've seen a lighthouse on that one . 
I wonder if we've got any books about lighthouses I don't think we have „ have we ? 
there might be something in that nursery rhyme book . 
I'll have a look later . 
underneath the ground and what sort of people would live under the ground ?

and then your fists are the apples . 
and the arms and let the wrists fall suddenly that's when the apples fall . 
then link hands to make a basket . 
that's good . 
no . 
I can't see anything else about apples . 
let's just have a quick look at page seventy one . 
it looks like it might have been xxx it's a teddy bear in the bath .[+ PI] 
oh you'll like this one . 
baby's shoes Mother's shoes Father's shoes policeman's shoes giant's shoes .[+ R] 
oh there's one I saw a ship a sailing .[+ R] 
well there's no lifeboats on that one and this one's if all the seas were one sea . 
<not a great sea> [?] . 
if all the seas were one sea what a great sea that would be .[+ R]

<I know>[<] there should be . 
right . 
another piece of toast , sweetheart ? 
do you know what we did with that piece of toast ? 
because [<] we were talking and I forgot . 
put jam on it and what did you ask for ? 
marmalade . 
xxx . 
Snugs [<] the dirty rascal do you mean I'm the dirty rascal ? 
right . 
I've just bought your megasketch [?] in here . [+ PI] 
this is what I think a lighthouse looks like . 
there . 
it looks like a trumpet upside down „ doesn't it ? 
<you can> [<] . 
oh . 
yes . 
you show me what you think a lighthouse is like . 
while I think about it rack my brains and think where have we got a picture of a lighthouse ? 
we've definitely got one somewhere . 
we must have . 
right . 
I'll just pop this in for another second because &-uh it doesn't seem very brown xxx in there a few moments . [+ PI] 
have you any idea where a lighthouse is &-um not (.) where a lighthouse is I mean is a picture of a lighthouse ? 
and what's that , Thomas ? 
<a lighthouse> [<] ? 
you are clever . 
that's the right shape . 
and I was thinking you can actually see they're always white „ aren't they ? 
always painted brightly so that ships can see them and then you have slats for windows on the way up . 
it's such a long time since I've been in one I can't remember but I remember being very excited when we went in it . 
yes . 
some big waves and there'll probably 0be seagulls around . 
and what about big rocks ? 
what would you like jam or marmalade on this one Thomas ? 
are you ? 
0 [=! sings] . 
Thomas you are a rowdy boy . 
alright that'll do . 
are you ? 
you <know when you pot up> [?] marmalade . [+ PI] 
oh it smells nice toast . 
there we are . 
toast and marmalade for my favorite boy . 
oh that's good . 
you've got the shape right Thomas you're very good now at drawing . 
I <think you> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
oh yes . 
well (.) a rocket or a lighthouse it's all the same . 
<what a shame> [<] . 
that's it don't let your toast go cold „ will you ? 
it looks like a cone shape actually it looks +//. [+ IN] 
that's what it looks like that cone . 
doesn't it ? 
when you think about it . 
here you are I've found you a picture of a lighthouse it's only a sketchy one . 
but look this boochy@f [?] . 
boochy@f at Bendinct's [?] point . 
and there's +... [+ IN] 
<a lighthouse> [<] look there's a door windows and can you see the light beaming round the top ? 
isn't that funny ? 
somebody's &-uh stuck the book together and they've stuck the picture upside down . 
there we are another lighthouse . 
suddenly we've got lots_of pictures of lighthouses . 
oh . 
and another . 
that's right in the middle of the sea „ isn't it ? 
yes this is a nice book . 
well I'm ever so pleased that we finally (.) have found a picture of a lighthouse . 
although I don't think it features in the story „ does it ? 
because there's a picture of the seaside look at all the cliffs and the rocks . 
oh . 
yes . 
oh now you see that's right that lighthouse looks like it's got a little cottage or something attached to it . 
oh . 
the lighthouse is at Bendincts point because I just read a little bit of the story . 
it says as usual the captain Frubisher [?] was waiting for budgie [?] when he arrived at the lighthouse at Bendinct's point . [+ PI] [+ R] 
so the lighthouse does feature in the story „ doesn't it ? 
well we'll read it in a little moment . 
<sounds &-uh like Daddy's up> [>] now so we might very well hafta &-uh +//. [+ IN] 
oh look and there's a fire engine <in it> [//] in the story . 
well I think it looks as if &-um (.) possibly the helicopter must be about to crash or I think that is . 
and there's the lighthouse again and this time it's night and there's a storm but can you see the light coming off the lighthouse ? 
it says here the gale was getting worse and xxx circled high above the storm to keep radio contact with the lighthouse . [+ PI] [+ R] 
so that must mean that the people in the lighthouse can talk through a radio to people <in the> [/] in the air „ mustn't it ? 
oh_gosh this is incredible because I was actually +//. [+ IN] 
do you know why I opened the drawer ? 
because I thought that there might be a holiday brochure in there . 
and if there was I thought we might find a picture of a lighthouse in the <and found this> [>] . 
yes . 
lighthouse again . 
well this is quite clever . 
listen to it . 
Daddy we've got two questions for you . 
no . 
one is do you know what worms are useful for ? 
Daddy's reading the gas bill and isn't &-uh listening . 
do you know what worms are useful for Daddy ? 
no . 
we don't know what the purpose of worms are . 
no . 
I don't Thomas said it's to make food for the plants . 
and the other +/. [+ IN] 
we were going to ask where there was a picture of a lighthouse but we've actually found one now „ haven't we ? 
do people still live in lighthouses Daddy ? 
it's computerized now ? 
have you been in a lighthouse ? 
xxx there's three questions now can Thomas go to the windmill near your Mum and Dad's ? [+ PI] 
<you know> [<] the one we went to where they make flowers still . 
and we've [/] we've just found this budgie book because we've found a picture of the lighthouse . 
and in it a fire engine xxx into <the sea> [>] as well . [+ PI] 
Daddy's just woken up „ haven't you Daddy ? 
<oh yes> [<] . 
well it says (.) Lionel made an emergency landing . [+ R] 
his rotors were completely bent and fire engines quickly approached . [+ R] 
so it sounds as if something's happened +/. [+ IN] 
oh . 
yes . 
I don't know what's happened but look at his blades . 
they're not good „ are they something's happened to them . 
you have fire engines at ordinary airports though „ don't you ? 
in case something happens to the planes when they come down . 
but I think this picture of a cone is pretty good lighthouse . 
if we were drawing a picture of a lighthouse and the base of the cone here could be the rocks and that could be the lighthouse . 
we could use that to trace round „ couldn't we ? 
right . 
are your hands sticky ? 
give them a quick rinse in the bowl please . 
roll your sleeves up and give them a quick rinse in the bowl there's a good boy . 
xxx .
