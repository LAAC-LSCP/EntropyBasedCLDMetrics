are you describing the new beaker that we bought you yesterday in Stockport ? 
in a shop . 
yes . 
it was in a shop . 
well just let me wash my hands . 
now listen , Thomas . 
this is made of plastic not glass . 
but if you drop it it's going to break . 
ow . 
Purdie (h)as just bitten my toe . 
Purdie ! 
Thomas do it . 
no [/] no [/] no . 
Thomas , don't . 
now . 
she didn't bite your foot . 
she didn't go anywhere near you . 
Purdie has always liked to [/] to bite people's toes if they're not wearing shoes . 
and I'm not wearing shoes . 
there you are . 
so this glass has on it James . 
it says “Thomas_The_Tank_Engine and Friends” . 
and there's Thomas and there's James and the fat controller . 
but if you drop it it'll break . 
yes . 
that's the fat controller . 
Thomas . 
and James . 
red James . 
look [/] look . 
if you +/. [+ IN] 
help [/] help . 
is that what he says ? 
if you shake it can you see all the silver glitter ? 
that's +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
he's waving the fat controller „ isn't he ? 
don't shake it when you've got a drink in it though . 
just shake it before you start to +/. [+ IN] 
+, put a drink in it . [+ IN] 
no . 
there's no drink in there „ is there ?

two trains . 
Percy and James . 
two trains . 
no . 
there's no juice in it .

Liam's Mummy is picking them up . 
look . 
two baskets together . 
oh [/] oh they're going in the car . 
now they're either going to the vet because they're poorly +/. [+ IN] 
+, or they might be going into the Cattery a little hotel for cats because they might be going on holiday . [+ IN] 
do you think they're poorly and they're going to the vets ? 
well sometimes +/. [+ IN] 
that's right . 
and make them better . 
sometimes pussy cats go the vets when they're not poorly to have injections so that they don't get poorly . 
that's right . 
a man (h)as gone past on a bicycle . 
what did you say ? 
man bike ride on . 
when you were a baby you sometimes useta go to the Doctor and have injections . 
there was nothing the matter with you at least not when we took you . 
there usually was when we brought you home . 
and that was so that you wouldn't get poorly later on . 
so pussy cats might be going to the vet for something like that . 
but I think they're going on their holidays . 
has she put them in the car and shut the door ? 
can you see all the rain water on these leaves , Thomas ? 
it looks quite sparkly „ doesn't it ?

she doesn't really bite hard . 
she just +/. [+ IN]

shall I show you what it is ? 
oh pop ! 
it's not two Smarties .

the green truck hasn't come for a few days „ has he ?

and you went straight back to sleep because Mummy said that Mummy and Daddy were still sleeping . 
Thomas was sleeping too . 
that's right . 
you gave Daddy a kiss . 
Daddy was asleep „ wasn't he ? 
but he gave you a kiss . 
and you got hold of the green blanket and you cuddled up back to sleep .

perhaps we should have got up though really because we're going to +/. [+ IN] 
ah that's lovely . 
are you giving a kiss ? 
no . 
leave the lampshade alone . 
Daddy's poorly . 
no .

the lampshade's broken . 
what's happening now ? 
big high up . 
<let's get> [//] let go of that now . 
okay . 
be very careful though when you're drinking orange juice out of a beaker like that .

start with the day on a cheery note with a yellow straw . 
we bought something else at +/. [+ IN] 
pardon . 
oh no . 
oh well when you're watching Pippin . 
yes . 
<I think they go> [//] one episode they go to a factory where they're making orange juice and putting it in cartons . 
and the cartons all have little straws . 
yes . 
you're drinking „ aren't you ? 
that's a nice noise . 
now you've got to eat food as well as drink . 
some cornflakes . 
who put that chair there ? 
all down chair . 
it was nearly all down Mummy „ wasn't it ? 
oops a daisy . 
big red James . 
the fat controller . 
wave . 
well we bought something else at the shop yesterday „ didn't we ? 
last week when we were in the same shop they had some little coasters [//] drinking coasters with pictures of Thomas_The_Tank_Engine and his friends on and we bought one that had a picture of Thomas . 
one Thomas . 
two Thomas . 
that's right . 
they match „ don't they ? 
that's right . 
we bought it because it's a nice size plate for putting things like grapes on and Smarties . 
and yesterday when we went back to the shop they had a sale . 
and they had little coasters . 
I don't know what we've done with it . 
another coaster with a picture of Henry . 
and seeing as your name is Thomas_Henry +/. [+ IN] 
+, we bought it „ didn't we ? 
but I don't know what we've done with it . 
oh here we are . 
I'll just rinse it under the tap (.) because it (h)as been in the shop . 
I'll just give it a quick wash . 
it's a green one . 
it's Henry . 
now I think there's Gordon James and Harold_the_Helicopter to collect . 
so you hafta +/. [+ IN] 
+, talk nicely to Grandma and Granddad because I'm not buying anymore . [+ IN] 
there you are . 
Thomas_Henry that's your name . 
Thomas_Henry . 
the green one . 
I think you must have been destined +/. [+ IN] 
two coasters . 
you must have been destined to be a Thomas_The_Tank_Engine fan with a name like Thomas_Henry „ mustn't you ? 
right . 
that's for Grandma . 
put it through here for her when she comes . 
Percy and Gordon . 
Thomas big ears . 
big ears . 
so now you've got a coaster with Thomas a coaster with Henry and a drinking beaker with James . 
there's some milk on the cornflakes . 
what's the matter ? 
green Henry . 
cornflakes . 
well those are cornflakes with milk . 
would you like me to put just a few dry cornflakes on Henry ? 
there you are . 
and a few on Thomas . 
there you are now . 
make sure you eat something today please because you hardly touches your food yesterday . 
Granddad was planing a trip to the pond later on . 
to the ducks . 
but I think if it's raining like this (.) you won't be able to go . 
some bread . 
yes . 
well Mummy was saving some (.) bread to take along . 
mind you . 
they're here until about eight o'clock this evening so it might start sunshining by then . 
I forgot to put your slippers back on when I changed your nappie . 
shall I pop them on now ? 
oh Thomas's little old man slippers . 
there you are , poppet . 
Mummy's little poppet , aren't you ? 
Nana and Granddad . 
when Nana and Granddad some and we all sit round the table for our evening meal we hafta pull the table out . 
Granddad usually sits there „ doesn't he ? 
when there's just Mummy Daddy and Thomas we can manage without pulling the table out . 
but when there are five of us to sit down instead of three we hafta pull the table out . 
I'm just thinking . 
last year , Thomas +//. [+ IN] 
you won't remember this because you were too little but Christmas_Day Grandma and Granddad come for a special meal on Christmas_Day . 
and last year the table was so full and four of us were sitting round . 
man dancing . 
do you remember Christmas ? 
you probably do . 
man dancing . 
you do remember quite a bit about Christmas . 
hm: . 
two Smarties . 
I think you remember more about Smarties than anything else . 
but last year you sat in your highchair Christmas_Day next to us . 
and this year you'll probably wanna sit at the table with us . 
oh dear dear . 
that's going to be a crowd „ isn't it ? 
and the man's coming and he'll be cross . 
what man's coming and what man's going to be cross ? 
oh are you talking about the cooker ? 
did you just say burn ? 
you're pointing to the white cooker „ aren't you ? 
that was a new cooker on [/] on +/. [+ IN] 
+, Friday . [+ IN] 
yes . 
a man fitted it „ didn't he ? 
and he said you mustn't touch it because it'll burn . 
it's very hot . 
and last year , Thomas , on Christmas_Day the cooker packed up in the middle of cooking the meal . 
we hadta potter around for about an hour while it sorted itself out and everything else cooked . 
and it (h)as taken us till August to get a new one . 
ugh ! 
I was really looking forward to that cup of tea and it's horrible . 
poo . 
and it doesn't taste as good . 
it's not very nice . 
I left it too long in the pot +/. [+ IN] 
stewed tea . 
not nice . 
all done now . 
you're eating the dry cornflakes off the coasters . 
you're making a lot of crunchy sounds „ aren't you ? 
yes . 
it's exciting eating off Thomas_The_Tank_Engine plates „ isn't it ? 
perhaps next week we'll go back to the shop and see what else they've got because they had some dinner plates and some little cereal bowls „ didn't they ? 
you useta have a beautiful teletubbie cereal bowl . 
I've not seen it for months and months . 
I've a feeling that you put it in the bin . 
orange juice . 
have you spilt a little +... [+ IN] 
oh you're going to suck it up your straw . 
that's right . 
you hoover it up with the straw like Noo_Noo does with the tubby custard . 
suck [/] suck not blow , darling . 
there you are . 
xxx . 
are you getting ratty with your straw ? 
I think you've probably bitten the end off . 
I'll get the scissors and just cut it so we can use it again to drink (.) from . 
oops . 
there we are . 
if we snip the ends +... [+ IN] 
are you going to drink it ? 
have you got the straw ? 
there you are . 
you're not having anymore drink when you've had that , Thomas . 
you've eaten a few cornflakes and that's not going to see you +/. [+ IN] 
+, through the day . [+ IN] 
here you are . 
some toast . 
blackcurrant and toast . 
are you referring to playgroup where you get blackcurrant and toast ? 
we haven't been to a playgroup this week „ have we ? 
and we won't be going next week either . 
well we'll go to the Beehive on Friday if the weather's nice . 
we'll probably go even if the weather's not nice (.) so that you can see (.) Gail and Daniel . 
and then we'll be there with Ben and Charlotte and perhaps Lauren will be there with her Mummy . 
Sonia and Isabel . 
well they don't usually go to the Beehive „ do they ? 
but they do sometimes . 
and Jenny might be there . 
and who else ? 
that little boy whose name I can never remember . 
James . 
aren't you clever ? 
oh that is nice , Thomas . 
no [/] no [/] no . 
you're talking about Thomas_The_Tank_Engine characters . 
the little boy is called James . 
that was the one I was thinking of . 
but I don't think we know anyone at playgroup called Percy . 
not yet anyway . 
what's that noise ? 
and then in a couple of weeks time the music group starts again . 
bang^a^drum^time@c . 
Purdie's home . 
is she having a sleep ? 
oh dear . 
did it go the wrong way ? 
it's not really dark . 
<it's dull> [/] it's dull „ isn't it ? 
during the day when the sun's not shining and it's raining and it's miserable like this we call it dull . 
it's dark at night . 
but it's dull during the day . 
no see Norman . 
no . 
I'm sure we could see him looking through your bedroom window but we can't see him from here because we're too low down . 
Thomas , would you like some toast ? 
well let's move your juice out of the way . 
that's right . 
sticky . 
well just lick it with your finger . 
hm: . 
we're being quiet „ aren't we ? 
eating our toast . 
does it taste nice ? 
yes . 
and they're probably in their car at the moment on the motorway (.) driving from Blackpool . 
pardon . 
they're coming to Stockport . 
David and Sharon came on Saturday with Grandma and Granddad but (.) they'll both be at work today . 
who's poorly ? 
Thomas . 
what's the matter with Thomas ? 
you've enjoyed drinking out of that „ haven't you ? 
oops .

that's a nasty cough . 
I think you hafta drink more slowly , Thomas . 
putting some more toast in the toaster . 
that's right . 
you tell me when it pops up . 
pop in a minute . 
you think it will . 
oh Thomas , pardon you . 
what do you say ? 
excuse me please . 
did you say grapes here you are ? 
I've washed some grapes . 
pop some on the Thomas plate and some on the Henry plate . 
we're sharing „ aren't we ? 
one two three four five six for Thomas . 
one two three four five six for Henry . 
and eight for Henry . 
now they both have the same . 
we have equal ones . 
and another two halves makes nine each so they have exactly the same . 
there's no squabbling . 
this piece is for me . 
this piece of toast . 
what would you like to wear today , Thomas ? 
a bib . 
you wanna go to the Trafford_Centre wearing a bib . 
it's a bit chilly I would've thought just for wearing a bib . 
should we put your nice dungarees on ? 
your white and green stripy ones . 
it's not too cold „ is it ? 
even though the sun's not shining . 
it's usually very warm in the Trafford_Centre . 
some more grapes . 
it's not Gordon „ is it ? 
who is on the plate ? 
Thomas and who else ? 
Henry . 
that's right .

slice them in half . 
two slices for Thomas . 
two slices for Henry .

two more for Henry . 
two more on this plate for Thomas and two more on that plate for Henry . 
there's only one grape left . 
I'll slice it in half and they can each have a half . 
and they're exactly the same so no fighting . 
they're sharing . 
blue green . 
that's right . 
you look as if you're eating them one at a time as well . 
one from the Thomas plate and one from the Henry plate . 
there's Mummy's friend Maureen outside . 
she (h)as not got her little doggy with her . 
her doggy's called Oliver „ isn't it ? 
because she said he's quite a greedy dog . 
and it reminds her of Oliver in the story . 
just a little bit more . 
what is it he says ? 
may I have some more ? 
and she said her dog would say that if it could so she (h)as called it Oliver . 
you've got a nasty scratch on your arm , Thomas .
