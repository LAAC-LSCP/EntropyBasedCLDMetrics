look at that big lorry outside . 
it's [<] a Scottish Powered [?] „ isn't it ?

it says important on it „ does it ? 
oh well if it says important Daddy can have it . 
we don't want anything important „ do we ?

we don't like that „ do we ? 
do we ? 
you wanna mess my hair ? 
well I've just washed it . 
it's wet . 
you like messing with my hair „ don't you ?

we went to a lot of trouble to get that postcard and get a stamp and find a postbox . 
you're not very grateful „ are you ? 
who calls you stupid ? 
well I've not heard anyone call you stupid . 
well who (h)as called you stupid ? 
perhaps it's because you say stupid all the time . 
it's just somebody just thinks of you as saying stupid and that's what they meant . 
do you think ? 
a barrier ? 
do you not wanna eat your breakfast now ? 
oh bless you . 
what do you say ? 
no . 
that's fine . 
but what about your barrier ?

I'm doing it once and then we're having our breakfast . 
because it's getting late .

<well I> [<] don't like you being grumpy .

now just calm down please . 
you [/] you're being very out of sorts . 
I don't know why . 
you went to bed alright last night . 
what's the matter ? 
you [//] well you're tired . 
is that the problem ? 
you're still tired ? 
you're certainly not having a sweetie from me . 
well for starters you've done nothing to deserve a sweetie . 
no . 
you had one sweet yesterday and that was one that Auntie_Linda had given you . 
and I told you last night you're not having any sweets from me . 
I don't think this morning's going to have helped . 
because you're just not being a nice boy . 
well just think on . 
when you're being a nice and good boy you get a sweet . 
when you're like you are now there's no way . 
do you really not like the postcard that Mummy and Daddy sent you ? 
well you've got your hand over the sign on the lorry . 
look (.) Royal_Mail .

I knocked all the bowls over . 
I just knocked all the bowls over .

<I'm going to have some> [<] Cornflakes I think . 
if you'd like some milk tell me „ won't you ? 
there's a magpie on the grass .

you'd like milk ? 
okay .

you're not putting the spoon in the post lorry when you've got milk on it . 
there you are . 
not [<] to put your spoon in . 
Thomas ! 
that's not very nice „ is it ? 
no ! 
stop it . 
no . 
it's not funny , Thomas . 
it's just silly . 
just think if anybody invites you round for breakfast I'll hafta say I'm sorry Thomas can't come because he doesn't know how to eat cereal politely . 
you'd be disappointed then „ wouldn't you ? 
they taste good ? 
Purdie , I've given you food . 
I don't know what Purdie's waiting for because she (h)as got some food . 
it's not very warm actually „ is it „ this morning ? 
are you warm enough ? 
would you like your dressing gown on ? 
okay [<] . 
you won't bother ? 
you're fine „ are you ? 
mm . 
we're both crunching away again „ aren't we ? 
I've put a bit more milk on mine than I normally have . 
they're <not quite> [>] as crunchy . 
I said I've put a little bit more milk on mine (.) than I normally have so mine are a little bit more crunchy „ aren't they ? 
who (h)as gone away ? 
Liam ? 
oh they're going to school „ aren't they ? 
mhm . 
yes . 
he'll have his school uniform on . 
I didn't actually see him . 
I presume he's going to school anyway . 
not quite sure because &-uh (..) some schools started Monday (.) some schools start on Wednesday . 
mm . 
this is nice . 
I'm getting mixed up with the days . 
<it is> [//] he will be going to school „ won't he ? 
it's Thursday „ isn't it ? 
I'm all mixed up because I haven't been to work on my usual day this week . 
so I'm all confused . 
silly , Mum . 
yes . 
it's Thursday because Ben started „ didn't he ? 
yesterday . 
Wednesday . 
Isabelle started Tuesday . 
people in Didsbury started on Monday . 
but &-um (.) Stephen's car hasn't gone „ has it ? 
oh (.) perhaps Stephen +//. [+ N] 
oh I don't know . 
there's a parcel force lorry pulling up now . 
look . 
I don't know . 
<all confused> [>] . 
so Jeannine's coming tomorrow (.) to see us . 
looking forward to that ? 
no ? 
why ? 
just no . 
because you're grumpy about everything today [>] „ aren't you ? 
right . 
okay . 
but you'll look forward to it when she comes „ won't you ? 
and you're going to Missus_Plattford's this afternoon . 
mhm . 
that is it . 
what did you do on Tuesday at Missus_Plattford's ? 
a teddy bear's picnic ? 
that was in July „ wasn't it ? 
that was in the summer before you broke up . 
that was in the summer . 
that was the very last day the teddy bear's picnic . 
but you went on Tuesday afternoon . 
what did you do on Tuesday afternoon at Missus_Plattford's ? 
I know you didn't do a painting like you normally do . 
did other people do paintings ? 
it was just you ? 
did you not wanna do one ? 
did they give you a choice whether you do one or not ? 
did they say would you like to do a painting ? 
and you told them you didn't wanna ? 
because you normally like painting „ don't you ? 
you're grumpy with painting „ as well ? 
were you grumpy at nursery on Tuesday ? 
well I was going to say you seemed alright . 
when I went to pick you up they (h)ad got lots_of farm animals on the table . 
had you been playing with the tractors and the trailers and the farm animals ? 
would they not fit ? 
oh dear . 
had they got the wrong tractors and trailers ?

oh she's ignoring me as well . 
it must be me today . 
look at her ! 
she's turning her head . 
look at her ! 
she's turning her head completely away from me . 
the more I'm calling her the more she's twisting her head the other way . 
honestly ! 
my children ! 
don't know why I bother [>] . 
yeah [<1] ? 
I [<2] +... [+ N] 
I wanted to do what , darling ? 
I did talk with Daddy . 
I talked with Daddy this morning before he went to work . 
<you were> [<] still asleep . 
yes ? 
be careful . 
no I wasn't upset in the night because I had Daddy to talk with . 
what happened +/. [+ N] 
when you went up to bed Daddy kissed you good_night „ didn't he ? 
and then he went out on his bicycle [//] on his mountain bike for a ride round . 
get some exercise . 
but he hadn't gone out for the night . 
he (h)ad only gone to ride around the block a few times . 
do you know where <he drove> [//] he rode to ? 
he went out of our drive (.) off Streetname Drive (.) turned left onto Burnedge_Lane (.) left onto Didsbury Road and he cycled all the way to the church (.) cycled round the church and then cycled back down Didsbury_Road and back down Burnedge_Lane and back to our house . 
see you think he (h)as been out all night but he was only out about half an hour . 
and then he came back and Mummy and Daddy had a cup of coffee +/. [+ N] 
oh Purdie's drinking her saucer of milk now . 
came back (.) we've had a cup of coffee . 
we watched the news . 
we had a talk and then we went to bed . 
and then this morning Daddy got up early (.) had a shower . 
put you into bed with me . 
do you not remember that ? 
Daddy lifted you out of your bed and put you in with me . 
do you remember ? 
no ? 
and you were still asleep and I cuddled you up with the quilt . 
and Daddy came [>] +... [+ N] 
the quilt on Mummy's bed . 
the duvet . 
and Daddy +/. [+ N] 
the gasman ? 
oh he's not coming here „ is he ? 
he (h)as just driven past . 
and Daddy said “bye bye , Thomas” and gave you a kiss and you actually said “night night , Daddy” . 
but it was really this morning . 
and Daddy gave me a kiss and we talked about going shopping this evening (.) at Tesco . 
so I did talk to him this morning before work . 
and we discussed what we were going to eat this evening . 
and we talked about all sorts of things . 
<and you> [<] were fast asleep and didn't hear us . 
&=laughs . 
you just slipped off that table . 
are you alright ? 
0 [=! laughing] . 
oh dear . 
did you not find that funny ? 
oh Purdie (h)as just drunk her milk . 
look . 
because I (h)ad put too much milk on my cereal (.) so I poured the remaining milk into a saucer and she (h)as just drunk it . 
have you seen what she's doing now ? 
she's sitting on your activity mat . 
you know the piece of carpet that's laid out with roads and pedestrian cross [//] crossings and things like that ? 
the fire station (.) the hospital and the shops ? 
Purdie (h)as decided it's a good place to sit and have a wash . 
that's alright . 
because [<] you sit on her rug in front of the fire „ don't you ? 
that's alright . 
it's all about sharing „ isn't it ? 
you share Purdie's rug <and she's sharing that> [>] . 
has she gone ? 
you did ? 
Thomas , would you like some toast ? 
or would you like a sandwich ? 
no don't say yuck@q . 
would you like a jam sandwich (.) a marmalade sandwich or some toast with something on ? 
well I'm going to do it because you need something . 
oh sorry , sweetheart . 
have I not given you a drink ? 
oh I'm sorry . 
is blackcurrant alright ? 
it isn't ? 
well do you want this special juice then ? 
alright . 
there's only this . 
that's the only bit of juice we have , Tom . 
only tiny bit of juice . 
how's that ? 
no . 
I don't water that down . 
if you want some more I'll get you some blackcurrant juice . 
we'll buy more of that when we go to the shop this evening . 
couldn't find the little straw that goes inside . 
that's better . 
there we are . 
very delicious . 
you've not (.) &-uh saved any of that for Purdie . 
you like your milk „ don't you ? 
well I think it's very cold today . 
you think it's cold as well ? 
it's not very nice „ is it ? 
at least it's not raining today which it normally is . 
oh steady . 
are you alright ? 
it (h)as got bones in it „ has it ? 
oh dear . 
doesn't sound very good „ does it ? 
jam sandwich or a marmalade sandwich , Thomas ? 
just bread ? 
it's alright . 
let me get you a plate . 
here's <your xxx > [>] +... [+ I] 
oh steady . 
Bob_the_Builder plate . 
oh dear , Thomas . 
excuse you . 
I heard you . 
that's drinking your juice too quickly . 
oh look ! 
the light (h)as gone off . 
just a minute . 
there we are . 
we've changed the battery in one of the microphones . 
because I glanced up and it was flashing on and off (.) red „ wasn't it ? 
so what do you think all the children are doing at school today , Thomas ? 
you think they're doing what ? 
having sweets ? 
you don't have sweets at school . 
I don't think so . 
do you ? 
hm: . 
I'd be very surprised . 
yes , darling [>] ? 
I know you do . 
would you like some more bread ? 
there you go . 
two flat ones ? 
well would you like a sandwich ? 
just bread on it's own ? 
okay . 
eat it nicely . 
I've just realized I haven't done anything with my hair . 
I've just washed it this morning and I've just left it . 
it needs brushing „ doesn't it ? 
I was going to use the hair dryer but then I thought it would wake you up so I didn't bother . 
mhm . 
did you have a nice sleep ? 
you were still up very early this morning „ weren't you ? 
even though I got up before you were still quite early out of bed . 
there we are . 
some nice jam . 
blackcurrant jam . 
mhm . 
it isn't yuck at all . 
it's nice . 
there you are . 
I'll leave that in case you want it . 
you sure ? 
isn't that boring ? 
just plain bread ? 
it's nice &bl [//] brown bread „ isn't it ? 
mhm . 
nice fresh bread . 
there's lots_of vans with ladders about this morning . 
there was a little gas van at one of the houses yesterday and it's back again this morning . 
and there's a big gas van there as well now . 
just behind Stephen's car . 
look . 
Stephen's getting into his car . 
and they're setting off . 
can't you ? 
why can't you see ? 
because of the plant ? 
oh . 
I know what it is . 
Daddy (h)as gone on his bike to work and left the car at home . 
and you can't see past the car „ can you ? 
<I'm a> [<] little bit taller than you so I can see . 
I was just wondering why you couldn't see . 
because normally you can see everything that goes on . 
but I've realized what it is . 
never mind . 
you've seen Stephen driving off many times . 
and I'm sure you'll see him do it again . 
we went to their house over the summer „ didn't we ? 
on the trampoline . 
I know . 
it looks like Liam (h)as gone to school „ doesn't it ? 
and you're at Missus_Plattford's this afternoon at nursery . 
mhm . 
well Isabelle's at school as well „ isn't she ? 
&liz [//] Isabelle (h)as gone to (.) a little school (.) it is a nursery school but she (h)as got to wear a school uniform (.) and she's wearing a straw boater . 
you know a little straw hat . 
she useta wear a little straw hat when she was very [/] very young . 
and now she wears a straw boater to go to school in . 
she started on Tuesday . 
no [/] no that's Thursday today . 
and Ben started at St_John's which is the school you're going to &Sep [//] in +/. [+ N] 
alright . 
that's fine . 
you've done very well . 
Ben started St_John's school in Heaton_Mersey which is the one you're going to (.) on Wednesday (.) yesterday . 
because I tried several times to ring Lynne to see how he (h)ad gone on . 
but there was nobody answering the phone . 
then when we went out for a walk last night before seven o'clock Ben's bedroom curtains were closed . 
so I would imagine he (h)as had a very tiring day and hadta go to bed early „ don't you ? 
and what about Charlotte ? 
what do you think Charlotte (h)as been doing ? 
you think Charlotte (h)as been painting ? 
I bet she'll miss him „ don't you ? 
because she (h)as always had a big brother at home . 
he's not there anymore . 
so , Thomas , this time next year you will have started the same school as Ben and you'll be a new boy . 
and Ben will [//] will have been there a year and he'll be able to tell you what goes on . 
because Ben is eight months older than you „ isn't he ? 
so whatever Ben has done you do shortly afterwards . 
<and do you> [>] +... [+ N] 
what's drink , love ? 
oh it is . 
I know it is . 
it's [/] it's blackcurrant juice that splashed up . 
that's why I was asking you to be careful (.) with the beaker . 
and next Wednesday , Thomas +/. [+ N] 
+, you're going to a new nursery . 
you're still going to see Missus_Plattford at Holly_Shackle [?] every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon . 
but as from next Wednesday every morning [>] +/. [+ N] 
might we ? 
oh I'm a coffee machine „ am I ? 
oh sorry . 
right . 
oh right . 
I know what you're going to do in a minute . 
<are you> [<] [/] are you listening to me about nursery next week ? 
be careful ! 
the table will collapse . 
Thomas ! 
my hand's a button „ is it ? 
on the coffee machine ? 
right . 
oh [<] . 
mhm . 
have you seen a [/] a coffee machine like that ? 
oh on Fireman_Sam . 
right . 
have you seen coffee machines , Thomas ? 
sometimes they have them around the place . 
<where you> [//] it's a machine and you put (.) press a button (.) put some money in (.) press a button +//. [+ N] 
I think they have them at the swimming baths . 
and a plastic cup comes down from the machine and it fills with either tea or coffee or hot chocolate or juice . 
do you know the machines I mean ? 
no ? 
vending machines . 
I'm going to show you something . 
well it's nothing terribly exciting (.) but +... [+ N] 
you see these plastic cups ? 
you know like we have at birthday partys ?
