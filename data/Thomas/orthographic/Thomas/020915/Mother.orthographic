is the ginger pussy cat eating some food outside ? 
are you playing with your digger ? 
you're putting them on the floor . 
you were playing with this yesterday . 
you really enjoyed it „ didn't you ? 
oh no . 
don't knock them all on the floor , Thomas . 
no . 
because we're [?] always picking it up . 
no [/] no [/] no [/] no . 
you see numbers . 
yes . 
but they're not numbers actually . 
they're letters . 
it says +"/. 
+" not suitable for children under thirty six months . [+ R] 
you shouldn't really be playing with them „ should you ? 
oops a daisy . 
they're letters of the alphabet . 
they're fridge magnets . 
I'm just wondering whether they would stick to this baking sheet . 
yes . 
they do . 
there we are . 
can you see on the back ? 
they've all got a strip of black and that's called a magnet . 
and things with magnets stick onto metal . 
and the fridge door is where we usually put magnets . 
look . 
we've got all these „ haven't we ? 
but you can play with them on the [/] the baking sheet on the table „ can't you ? 
look . 
they stick . 
so if we tip it upside down +... [+ IN] 
it's magic . 
they don't fall off . 
you wanna take them off and put them in your digger . 
well I was going to try and make the word Thomas . 
no , Mummy . 
you don't want me to do that . 
we've got some other magnets here . 
these are called magnetic memo holders . 
memo holders . 
what you can do is +... [+ IN] 
I'll show you on the fridge . 
there's a little piece of paper there . 
look . 
and I might write a little note in it to Daddy saying your tea is in the oven . 
and then I can pop it on the fridge door and stick one of these on top , Thomas . 
look . 
so the paper stays on the door . 
is that somebody putting something through the letter box ? 
there's a gentleman standing outside . 
a gentleman . 
I don't think he knows we're inside „ does he ? 
what is it ? 
a fire engine . 
oh it's says oil on it . 
it must be a tanker carrying oil . 
and that's a green cement mixer . 
oh you know what that is „ don't you ? 
what's that ? 
a steam roller . 
and do you think that could be a dustbin lorry ? 
is it ? 
I think we might have another packet somewhere . 
I seem to think Mummy bought two packets of fridge magnets . 
I can't see the other one though so perhaps I only bought one . 
we saw those in a shop a long time ago . 
I'd forgotten I'd bought [?] them . 
ah yes . 
I have . 
they've slipped right to the back of the door . 
you wanna put them in a train . 
there you are . 
you've got more +... [+ IN] 
ah that says fire@q . 
that's the fire engine . 
and then a big red London bus . 
that van says repairs@q and carrying ladders on his side . 
and that might be an ambulance . 
I'm not sure . 
it's got a flashing light on top . 
is it ? 
I think what we'll do with these +... [+ IN] 
I'll get them in the packets that they came in . 
and we've got an old margarine tub somewhere with a lid „ haven't we ? 
so we could store them in one of those „ couldn't we ? 
what would you like to put them in ? 
pardon . 
oh it +... [+ IN] 
well that's the bag the jigsaws came in yesterday . 
do you think they'll fit in that little box or is that too [/] (..) too small ? 
is it not too small ? 
well we'll use that then . 
if we keep them all together they're not going to get lost „ are they ? 
you're saying Old_MacDonald had a farm . 
we went to nursery not nursery playgroup „ didn't we ? 
yesterday . 
&-um what am I talking about ? 
this morning . 
you wouldn't talk . 
no . 
I was just about to say that . 
when it came to song time you didn't wanna join in . 
what was the matter ? 
you didn't seem to wanna sing any songs . 
the only time you livened up was when we started to do &-um Ring a Ring_Roses and a Grand_Old_Duke_Of_York and the Hokey_Cokey . 
you liked that . 
let's have a look . 
it looks like &-um I would say some sort of digger like this . 
is that little box big enough , Thomas ? 
is it not ? 
well you saw Isabel „ didn't you ? 
you saw Sonia . 
and Charlotte was there with Lynne . 
and we walked there and back with Jo and Becky „ didn't we ? 
well that says oil@q on it so it must be an oil storage tank . 
lots_of numbers . 
they're letters , Thomas . 
letters of the alphabet . 
not numbers . 
the dustbin wagon . 
no bee^bas@c . 
when you were at Grandma and Grandad's house yesterday you saw the binmen emptying their bins . 
and our dustbin man really comes late „ doesn't he ? 
normally . 
so Grandad said +"/. 
+" when we get back to Stockport we'll be able to watch the binmen at your house . 
but when you came home they'd already been „ hadn't they ? 
so you missed them . 
but then when we were walking to playgroup <this morning> [>] +/. [+ N] 
the dustbin wagon . 
I think it might be that one , Thomas . 
or perhaps that one . 
it looks like a road sweeper „ doesn't it ? 
that's a little hole in the baking sheet . 
no . 
it doesn't . 
no . 
it's meant to be there . 
it's not broken . 
and as we were walking to toddler group this morning we saw all the black bin bags out on the estate behind us „ didn't we ? 
so it's obviously the dustbin day here . 
not collect them . 
no . 
they hadn't collected them when we saw them but it must be their dustbin bag collection day today . 
shall we have something to eat , Thomas ? 
no . 
do you think the train man would like a chocolate ? 
well it would be chocolates I was looking at or would he like a jelly baby ? 
a jelly baby . 
Grandad brought jelly babies „ didn't he ? 
there we are . 
you mustn't eat them all at once . 
you're sharing it with the train driver . 
that's nice . 
it's delicious . 
you say delious@c „ don't you ? 
jelious@c . 
it might be jelious@c because it's made of jelly . 
what's that little rhyme we know , Thomas ? 
jelly on the plate . 
on the plate . 
&=laughs . 
wibble_wobble@o . 
wibble_wobble@o . 
come back Betty . 
come back Paul . 
I think you've just put the ending of two little dickie birds „ haven't you ? 
after the nursery rhyme . 
we sang that this morning but you wouldn't . 
you sat really still on Mummy's knee . 
you wouldn't sing “Aunt_Polly had a Dolly” and you wouldn't sing “the wheels on the bus” . 
and we did that other one that's your favorite . 
+" five cheeky monkeys . 
you wouldn't do that . 
and “incey_wincey@wp spider” . 
the jelly babies are there . 
where are the other ones ? 
they've gone in your tummy . 
gosh that was quick . 
I left them on the table . 
I've just turned my back and they've gone . 
now listen when you've had that one that's really is it . 
there are no more . 
it's delicious „ is it ? 
the train driver doesn't need another one . 
does that mean you're going to eat it for him ? 
well at least you offered it to him „ didn't you ? 
it's nice that you're sharing . 
oh you're having another one . 
that's it , Thomas . 
they're no more . 
the sweetie wrapper's empty „ isn't it ? 
shall we have one of these special chocolates ? 
you don't need a chocolate . 
oh dear dear dear . 
we've knocked the Smartie pot over . 
oh my goodness . 
that's better . 
oh my goodness . 
we've spilt them . 
oh dear dear , Thomas . 
there's an orange one a red one and a yellow one . 
would you like to eat those ? 
do you wanna put them back in the pot ? 
you don't wanna eat any now . 
catch it . 
there's a yellow one on the floor there . 
look . 
oh they really went with a bang „ didn't they ? 
thank you . 
oh there are a lot on the floor down here , Thomas . 
in fact I'm going to get a little pot and put them in . 
you heard a bang . 
have you just dropped something ? 
what have you dropped ? 
I can see lots_of Smarties down there . 
yes . 
well seeing as they've been on the floor we won't put them back in the Smartie pot . 
we'll just put them in this little tub . 
oh they went everywhere „ didn't they ? 
and did you play with Isabel this morning ? 
what were you doing with Isabel ? 
you don't know . 
where you running round ? 
and she (h)as not been very well „ has she ? 
in fact Sonia and Isabel only live a few minutes away from the playgroup . 
and this morning Isabel didn't wanna walk . 
she asked her Mummy if she could go in her pushchair . 
so I think she must be feeling quite delicate , Thomas . 
don't you ? 
Isabel felt like a jelly baby „ did she ? 
you mean all wiggly and wobbly . 
wiggly and wobbly . 
wiggly and wobbly . 
I think we'll be finding the oops Smarties for ever more , Thomas . 
don't you ?

you don't need any Smarties . 
would you like a chocolate instead ?

would you like one of those ? 
you'd like that one . 
the blue one . 
I'm sure it works . 
you just needta take the wrapper off . 
there we are , poppet . 
and after that you can have a drink . 
mm that's nice . 
Mummy's feeling very generous today . 
yes . 
the chocolate's from Sue . 
for Christmas „ weren't they ? 
and when that tube's empty that would make a nice storage pot for something „ wouldn't it ? 
I think it's a little bit too large for your fridge magnets . 
perhaps that would be a nice pot to keep your pencils in . 
because it's shaped a bit like a pencil „ isn't it ? 
it looked like Stephen's Daddy's going to pick +... [+ IN] 
&-uh not Stephen's Daddy . 
Liam's Daddy Stephen's going to pick him up from school in the car .

oh you've put a glove on „ have you ? 
on your hand . 
and you're calling it a glove .

is this plaster to go on my foot ? 
you mended it .

I think it's gone half past five . 
why are you telling me to stop it ?

I'm not allowed to get up „ aren't I ? 
but I thought you said I was well enough to go home .

because of what ?

yes . 
I think it is a little bit now . 
we might go for a walk after tea . 
look . 
your slippers are breaking „ aren't they ? 
hafta get Daddy to mend them . 
this bit on the bottom of your slipper's called the sole . 
and it's coming away from the soft part of the slipper „ isn't it ? 
let's have a look at the other one . 
this one's the same . 
you've got to be careful because you might trip up . 
&-um . 
oh you tripped up on purpose then . 
you didn't fall over your slipper „ did you ? 
where have they come from ? 
they needta be in the washing machine „ don't they ? 
I don't know . 
I didn't see them there on the floor and all of a sudden they appeared . 
right . 
where's my shoe ? 
here it is . 
can I go home now ? 
I'm going to put these two sheets and the blanket +... [+ IN] 
+, back in the linen bin upstairs . [+ IN] 
and they'll go in another cooler wash later „ won't they ? 
thank you . 
we can go home „ can we ? 
of course we can .

we've got this rubbish bag that can go outside as well . 
I think we needta go to bathroom to rinse that „ don't we ? 
and there's the bag from when we went out this morning . 
that needs to go upstairs . 
we'll leave that over here . 
and I'll remember to take everything up when I next go .

Mummy . 
Mummy doesn't wear nappies . 
oh no . 
Mummy doesn't need nappies , Thomas . 
not any more . 
is it a bumpy ride ? 
I'm surprised it's a bumpy ride in the kitchen floor because the floor is very smooth „ isn't it ? 
you've had a lot of pleasure out of that jigsaw . 
just as much pleasure riding it round in the back of your train than you have putting it together (.) „ haven't you ? 
a bumpy road or a bumpy ride . 
what did you say ? 
I know you've been saying bumpy ride but did you say bumpy ride then or did you say it's a bumpy road ? 
a bumpy road . 
there's a little bit of a hill there where the kitchen floor meets the dining room floor . 
what's the matter ? 
did you ? 
what sort of light ? 
a white one . 
a white light . 
you mean from outside . 
it might be Daddy home . 
shall we have a look ? 
have a look out of the window and see what you can see . 
no . 
there's a car coming up there though . 
ah it is Daddy . 
it is . 
he's flashing his lights at you . 
it wasn't Daddy though before „ was it ? 
that you saw . 
it is Daddy now but it wasn't before when you said you could see a white light . 
because as you said that Daddy wasn't even on the road . 
wait for him to come in , Thomas . 
we'll just hafta move these bags . 
just step back , sweetheart . 
step back .

there's two fire engines outside of our house „ aren't there ? 
with the blue lights flashing . 
oh dear dear . 
there (h)as been a fire next door „ hasn't there ? 
oh . 
oh we were having our tea „ weren't we ? 
and Mummy saw the blue flashing lights and I went out . 
and Fred and Rachel's house is on fire . 
they're not . 
so we've got baby Miles asleep in the sofa now „ haven't we ? 
so that he's not in a smoky house . 
yes . 
oh can you see a fireman ? 
ah . 
oh I think there (h)as been a fire in the roof of Fred and Rachel's house . 
has he got a hosepipe ? 
oh . 
yes . 
oh unfortunately if there's a fire in a roof he might hafta put some water through the [/] the roof „ mightn't he ? 
big blue lights flashing . 
you [>] can probably hear the noise of the fire engine on the tape . 
oh there's quite a few of the neighbors have come out . 
Rachel over at the other side . 
she (h)as come for a look . 
there are two fire engines . 
and meanwhile we've got a baby asleep on the sofa „ haven't we ? 
yes .

don't wake the baby up . 
we want a baby asleep „ don't we ? 
yes . 
oh . 
oh dear . 
the baby's waking . 
alright , sweetheart . 
you tell Miles what (h)as happened . 
your roof (h)as come off , Miles . 
I don't think it's quite as serious as his roof coming off but +... [+ IN] 
yes . 
you were watching a program about fire engines before . 
oh look . 
here comes his hose now . 
hm: . 
yes . 
he's going to hafta put the hosepipe through the roof unfortunately „ isn't he ? 
the fireman's running „ isn't he ? 
Daddy (h)as just gone round to see one of the other neighbors . 
but when he comes back he might take you outside . 
and you can maybe have a talk to the fireman . 
Mummy (h)as got to stay inside because we've got Miles „ haven't we ? 
yes . 
look . 
Sue (h)as come out as well . 
yes . 
Sue (h)as come out of the house to have a look . 
she probably thinks it's our house . 
because the [/] the fire engines are actually parked outside our house „ aren't they ? 
well the roof (h)as caught fire „ hasn't it ? 
blue fire . 
well it's smoke „ isn't it ? 
you can smell smoke . 
it's alright , Miles . 
you want Daddy to come back „ don't you ? 
so that you can go and have a look at the fireman . 
you've just seen Jo . 
has Jo come for a look ? 
oh yes . 
everybody's out looking „ aren't they ? 
look . 
Liam's out with his Daddy .
