Brian ? 
well it looks like he (h)as discovered a little bit more rubbish . 
and the dustbin men are on their way so he's doing what Mummy often does and taking it out for the dustbin men just before they get here . 
what's your dustbin bag , sweetheart ? 
yes . 
<we've got> [//] we've only got one dustbin bag today „ haven't we ? 
we normally have two or three . 
we've only one today . 
oh I don't think Purdie's really too bothered about the dustbin men , Thomas . 
I think she's a little bit frightened . 
of the [/] the noise of the lorry . 
it sounds like it's getting closer . 
can you hear it ? 
shall I get the little stool for you to climb on ? 
no ? 
are you sure ? 
I'll sit with you . 
oh [>] . 
like this ? 
&=laughs . 
I'm very big .

isn't that nice ? 
what's it called ? 
what's he called . 
I don't know . 
I really don't know what he's called . 
I don't know what any of the men are called . 
isn't that sad ? 
<they come> [<] +... [+ IN]

ever since Daddy (h)as been leaving the car at home we [/] we haven't such a good view „ have we ? 
doesn't he ? 
oh . 
has he told you ? 
I didn't know that . 
why does he not like them ? 
I don't think he minds them , Thomas . 
I never heard him say he doesn't like them . 
I think he's very grateful to them for carrying the rubbish away every day . 
don't you ? 
now be careful climbing <on there> [>] . 
can you see ? 
<can you see> [<] the men walking down there ? 
well they're delivering all the clean bags „ aren't they ? 
and they're picking up the dirty bags of rubbish .

one day . 
yes .

he lifted you up and let you press the button ? 
that was nice „ wasn't it ? 
it'll be coming along in a minute . 
they've got quite a lot of things to do .

the man's delivering a clean bag at Sue's house .

they must be &-um leaving the bags at different places I think now . 
look . 
there's a white plastic bag blowing +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
did you see that blowing across the road ? 
it's a beautiful sunny day but it's very cold outside . 
and it's ever so windy .

in the window in the sun .

Thomas , no .

oh here he is . 
the man himself . 
are you going to wave at the driver ? 
that's right . 
wait till he looks at you . 
perhaps he (h)as not seen you . 
he's not looking in the house „ is he ? 
I don't think he's looking in . 
he won't hear you banging the window .

what's Mummy saying ? 
is Mummy saying something to you ?

let's just wipe the little sleep from your [//] the [//] your eyes . 
little bit of sleepy dust in the corner of your eye [>] . 
Thomas_Henry Lastname „ is it ? 
you're talking to the tape recorder ? 
nobody listening to you ? 
well (.) let Mummy have the headphones and then you talk and I can listen through the headphones . 
what would you like to tell me , Thomas ? 
oh . 
hello , Thomas . 
I haven't been anywhere . 
I've just been watching the dustbin man with you +//. [+ IN] 
don't touch any buttons ! 
you mustn't press anything .

I think we should go for a walk while the sun's still shining and it's nice and sunny . 
because it's +/. [+ IN] 
you want your wellies and wanna play in the back garden ? 
okay . 
okay . 
we'll do something . 
so shall we do it now ?

let's get you changed . 
what did you say then ? 
baby Louise ? 
you're baby Louise „ are you ? 
you're an apple man ? 
well you've gathered your stones in a box . 
are you pretending they're apples ? 
oh are these for me ? 
oh let me have a look . 
yes please . 
you can open the box . 
that's xxx . [+ PI] 
oh they're apples „ are they ? 
oh that's lovely . 
thank you very [/] very much . 
yes . 
I'll eat them . 
yes . 
thank you . 
I'll only eat one at a time though . 
thank you . 
oh that's lovely . 
a big huge one . 
gosh . 
yes it is huge „ isn't it ? 
I'll bet it (h)as got a pip in it . 
that one . 
it's very big . 
I think I'll hafta slice that into smaller pieces before I could eat that . 
some smaller ones ? 
mhm . 
which [/] [<] which is the largest stone , Thomas ? 
that's right . 
which is the next largest ? 
yes . 
and what about the next one ? 
yes . 
then what about the other four ? 
yes . 
no [/] no . 
that one first I would say . 
yes . 
that [<] one . 
and that one . 
that's the smallest „ isn't it ? 
that's the smallest . 
there we are . 
let's put them in order like that . 
look at that . 
that's how we go with stones . 
<they're> [<] [/] they're apples are they ? 
alright . 
the box of apples is closed . 
yeah . 
okay . 
just be careful you don't drop them . 
because they're very heavy stones , Thomas . 
if they land on your toe they'll hurt „ won't they ? 
it is very [/] very heavy . 
right , sweetheart . 
let's get you changed . 
why don't you bring the box here ? 
because they're going to be to heavy to bring back . 
bring the box back here . 
the box is going to be too heavy to carry , Thomas . 
if you keep putting stones in it . 
full of heavy apples „ is it ? 
<oh thanks> [>] +... [+ IN] 
oh thank you so much . 
it's very kind . 
thank you . 
oh yes . 
I'll eat them . 
yes . 
we'll have an apple later „ shall we ? 
yes ? 
right . 
we've just been out for a walk with Jo and Becky „ haven't we ? 
and Sooty was running about . 
Sooty the dog . 
yes . 
somebody's going to Jo's house to cut the dogs hair . 
the clippers coming to clip Sooty's fur . 
or his hair . 
Sooty's a dog like Pippin „ isn't he ? 
like Auntie_Mabel's Pippin . 
so Jo +//. [+ IN] 
I don't know . 
so Jo wanted to take Pippin out so he (h)ad had a good run round before the dog clipper came . 
yes . 
oh I can see the apples . 
yes . 
very nice . 
right . 
let me open this parcel and see what I've got inside it . 
oh it looks like a little boy called Thomas_Henry . 
it's an apple ? 
shall I take your shoes off ? 
yeah . 
no . 
Purdie doesn't usually eat apples „ does she ? 
do you know what Grandma's pussy cat ate the other day when I was there ? 
some pastry . 
I've never ever known a pussy cat like pastry before . 
but Grandma's pussy cat eats a little bit of pastry . 
it was from an apple pie . 
a piece of apple pie . 
<what do> [<] you mean ? 
why did Gelly eat the apple or <oh &-uh> [//] the pastry . 
I don't know why she ate it . 
she must just have been hungry and decided she liked pastry . 
and so she eats it now whenever there's pastry about . 
I don't think Purdie likes pastry „ does she ? 
I don't think so . 
you think so „ do you ? 
you going to <lie down> [>] , sweetheart ? 
no . 
I'd like +//. [+ IN] 
well yes . 
later . 
I'd like you to just lie down +/. [+ IN]

another cold day . 
is it a very cold day ? 
ah the apple man's sleeping „ is he ? 
ah little apple man . 
little apple man (h)as got nice legs „ hasn't he ? 
xxx got nice little legs . [+ PI] 
hm: [=! laughs] . 
ah . 
ah . 
you've got nice little legs but they're ever so cold . 
right . 
you sleep on your back and then I can do this . 
oh your vest feels wet „ doesn't it ? 
yeah ? 
no . 
your jumper's not wet . 
but your vest is . 
can you just sit there a minute while I go and get you a clean vest please . 
don't start moving because you'll fall off . 
sit still . 
sit still , Thomas . 
alright , Thomas . 
that's the talcum powder . 
yes . 
if you squeeze talcum powder it does look a little bit like smoke „ doesn't it ? 
coming out . 
so we won't do that . 
let's <lift your arms up> [>] . 
oh dear . 
right . 
let's take your vest off from the top . 
you're going to show me ? 
oh well you've dropped it on the floor now so +//. [+ IN] 
do I ? 
well I shall pick it up in a minute when I've got you dressed . 
come on . 
let's put this clean vest on . 
clean jumper on so you don't get cold . 
is it just +/. [+ IN] 
in a moment . 
I shall get it when I've put your jumper on , Thomas . 
you're going to get cold . 
your body feels very cold anyway . 
you do feel a cold boy . 
there's no point getting you any cooler „ is there ? 
that's it . 
arms through there . 
lovely . 
I don't think you had any mittens on when you went out „ did you ? 
<oh yes> [<] . 
a little bit of powder's coming out „ isn't it ? 
what's it like ? 
train smoke ? 
is it like the smoke you see from a steam train ? 
no . 
don't do that , Thomas . 
if the lid comes off you'll be in a terrible mess „ won't you ? 
you're squeezing it out „ are you ? 
right . 
well talcum powder's very messy . 
we don't want that everywhere „ do we ? 
no [/] no we don't . 
right . 
you'll hafta move it now because I can't do what I'm trying to do with you holding it . 
you had your hair cut „ didn't you ? 
on Saturday . 
Granddad's house . 
yes . 
who cut it ? 
Michael the hairdresser cut it „ didn't he ? 
wasn't actually at Granddad's house you had it cut „ was it ? 
it was at the barber's . 
but it's the barber that Granddad goes to . 
pardon ? 
that's where you work ? 
you're pointing to your slide and your swing . 
is that where you work ? 
there we are . 
you feel a bit fresher now , sweetheart ? 
the apple man's still sleepy „ is he ? 
did you say still sleepy or too sleepy ? 
he's too sleepy . 
he's too sleepy to do anymore work ? 
oh well . 
has the apple man been up very [/] very early in the morning picking all the apples from the trees in the orchard ? 
and packing them into boxes ready to sell ? 
he (h)as been a busy apple man „ hasn't he ? 
you've been delivering them to Mummy's house „ have you ? 
well we go through a lot of apples . 
we could do with a special delivery of apples „ couldn't we ? 
well because I eat a lot of apples . 
so does Daddy . 
so does you . 
I mean so do you . 
&=laughs . 
I can't believe I just said that . 
oh he's awake ? 
hello , apple man . 
do you sell anything else apart from apples ? 
and oranges ? 
apples and oranges . 
so really you're a fruit [>] +... [+ IN] 
and pears ? 
are you a greengrocer ? 
are you ? 
you live in your big [/] big lorry . 
and it's what ? 
blue and white ? 
and red ? 
yellow wheels and black wheels ? 
oh we saw some men today when we were walking home with Jo „ didn't we ? 
what were those men doing on Bluestone_Drive ? 
what were they doing ? 
it was a big orange lorry „ wasn't it ? 
and it had a sign on it that said stop and go . 
and the men were drilling some holes in the ground and erecting some bollards . 
because I think some people have been driving through with cars „ haven't they ? 
and that's a bit naughty . 
so they were putting up some bollards to stop people doing that . 
just open the door because I think Purdie wants to go out . 
well she wants a little look round the garden „ doesn't she ? 
what's not ready yet ? 
oh no . 
well he was putting some &-uh bollards up „ wasn't he ? 
there were two men working on it . 
no . 
the lorry (h)as probably driven off now because we've been home a little while „ haven't we ? 
and they dug the hole and they got the bollards in place and I think were just going to put cement around the post to keep them in place . 
pardon ? 
yes . 
somebody (h)as driven over the path and they shouldn't do that „ should they ? 
it's not very nice . 
well fire engines in emergency I think that's a little bit different if fire engines <have driven over somewhere> [>] . 
yes . 
so a fire engine can go over the footpath if it's necessary but I don't think it's necessary for people to drive cars on that bit of grass „ do you ? 
because it's nice there . 
it's part of the park . 
and people are spoiling it by driving over it . 
can you remember that Sunday morning when we went for a walk ? 
it was Sunday afternoon actually . 
and there were people driving . 
there were motorized go carts and all sorts . 
it was quite dangerous because they were going very [/] very quickly „ weren't they ? 
and we were just out for a nice gentle stroll . 
and we saw some other people with prams and lots_of elderly people . 
some pushchairs . 
yes . 
I don't know whether you remember because it's going back a few Sundays now . 
but there was a little boy on a bicycle and he fell off . 
do you remember ? 
he was with his Mummy and Daddy . 
but he was cycling in front ahead of them . 
it was quite near the pond . 
do you know where I mean ? 
and he fell off his bike „ didn't he ? 
well he just lost his balance and tumbled . 
yes . 
and his Daddy went running to him „ didn't he ? 
I don't think he was hurt . 
just a little bit shocked because he (h)ad fallen over . 
he did . 
the man +//. [+ IN] 
that's quite right , Thomas . 
you are remembering the right thing because +/. [+ IN] 
the Daddy ran over the grass . 
the little boy's Daddy „ didn't he ? 
because the little boy had fallen off . 
and I think the Daddy was running to check that the little boy hadn't hurt himself . 
if you fall over I go running to you . 
don't I ? 
you've been a very good boy today Mister Lastname . 
<did you> [<] know that ? 
Mummy (h)as been very proud . 
you're Fireman_Sam „ are you ? 
Fireman_Sam collecting all the apples . 
oh . 
in the village ? 
do you mean you're collecting them in the village or you're selling them in the village ? 
delivering them ? 
delivering them in the village . 
oh yes . 
that's your fireman from your small fire engine „ isn't it ? 
with your nice yellow helmet on . 
oh Purditer ! 
oy ! 
don't do that . 
oy [/] oy ! 
well Purdie's sharpening her claws on the edge of the chair . 
which is a bit naughty because she (h)as got a scratching post just behind the chair . 
they hafta sharpen their claws you see (.) pussy cats . 
and she usually does it outside on the tree but we have a nice scratching post inside . 
but she didn't use the scratching post then . 
she just went ahead and used Mummy's chair . 
<the sofa> [<] . 
wasn't nice „ was it ? 
well I think it probably is quite nice to [/] <to sharpen her claws on> [>] . 
the little fireman's doing what , sweetheart ? 
<I don't know what you said> [<] . 
oh it's raining now , Thomas . 
looks like we went out at the right time . 
it wouldn't be nice if we (h)ad been out now „ would it ? 
let me just pull your trousers up and then I'm going to wash my hands . 
and then shall [>] +/. [+ IN] 
there was something Mummy wanted to look at . 
yes . 
we can wash yours as well . 
yes . 
would you like your hands washing ? 
<no no> [/] no ? 
oh . 
just me ? 
I'll close that door now . 
now that <pussy cat's here> [>] . 
he's not . 
he's certainly not doing that on my head , Thomas . 
<no no> [/] no . 
right . 
could you sit down please . 
before you fall . 
I'll just run it so we get some nice warm water . 
Thomas , sit down please . 
oh . 
yes . 
I've got something to show you . 
no [/] no . 
I've just sat you down here at the table so I can show you something . 
but I was just going to wash your hands because we've been out and we've been touching Sooty „ haven't we ? 
he's blue and white „ isn't he ? 
yes . 
little fireman (h)as got his yellow helmet on and he (h)as got two faces . 
one's blue and one's white . 
he spins round „ doesn't he ? 
oops a daisy . 
yes . 
he (h)as gone dizzy and fallen on the floor „ hasn't he ? 
I think he lost his balance . 
he was spinning round „ wasn't he ? 
round and round and round . 
and then he fell . 
Thomas , you're so tired . 
have you been useta having a little sleep at Nana and Granddad's during the day ? 
poor you ? 
ah poor you . 
yes . 
poor you . 
oh pull ? 
do you mean pull ? 
as in you want me to pull you ? 
why do you want me to pull you ? 
you want me to pull you ? 
pull you along ? 
I shan't bite you . 
no . 
no [/] no . 
let's pull your little socks up because I do think you feel cold today . 
right . 
would you like to have a look at the something to show you . 
what's this ? 
yes . 
I did . 
this is the jewelery box that Daddy bought . 
we've not really done anything with it „ have we ? 
but do you remember Mummy buying you that little badge ? 
I bought that at York station for you . 
yes . 
because when I got to the station the train to Manchester was just leaving . 
and I hadta wait a little while longer . 
do you like that ? 
yes . 
I'll just move that . 
thank [<] you . 
that's the key . 
that's a tassle „ isn't it ? 
what have we got ? 
what shall we put in ? 
look . 
there's [<] some beads here . 
that's right . 
yes . 
you can keep your Thomas_The_Tank_Engine bag in my jewelery box . 
that's nice „ isn't it ? 
oh now like at this . 
look at this necklace . 
look I can put it on . 
does that look nice ? 
oh Auntie_Mabel ? 
does she wear necklaces like this ? 
right . 
would you like to put it round your neck ? 
when you do have a look in the mirror there . 
can you see ? 
you've got a necklace on . 
Fireman_Sam's not wearing a necklace ? 
is he not ? 
look at this . 
you've got to be careful with this , darling . 
because the beads are very delicate . 
this is a gold chain . 
look at this . 
oh it says Saint_Michael . 
Marks and Spencer . 
<I can't remember> [/] I can't remember where this is from . 
I think Daddy must have bought Mummy this . 
there . 
now when Mummy was little there was a program on television +//. [+ IN] 
I think it's still actually on now (.) called Trumpton . 
that was all about a fire station . 
and the Lord_Mayor (.) he useta come to the fire station . 
he had a big gold chain like this . 
oh there you are . 
very important people have big gold chains like this . 
don't you ? 
look at this . 
is it ? 
oh I see . 
you're pretending the key to the jewelery box is opening Fireman_Sam's +/. [+ IN] 
fire engine „ are you ? 
can you see this , Thomas ? 
this little brooch . 
what's that a brooch of ? 
what is it ? 
brooch . 
but do you know what it is ? 
pussy cat . 
the pussy cat's smiling ! 
yes . 
it (h)as got a nice grin „ hasn't it ? 
grinning like a Cheshire cat . 
Purdie's a Cheshire cat „ isn't she ? 
your necklace ? 
that's right . 
that's your badge . 
Mummy +//. [+ IN] 
<this is a brooch> [/] this is a brooch rather than a badge . 
now this is some wool . 
I don't quite know what the wool's doing in the jewelery box . 
but (.) did you see the program on Auntie_Mabel and Pippin about wool ? 
they were +//. [+ IN] 
what was she using the wool for , Thomas ? 
she was knitting a jumper „ wasn't she ? 
what color was the jumper ? 
blue . 
and who was she knitting it for ? 
can you remember ? 
I think it was for her sister Eddie „ wasn't it ? 
and she hadn't quite finished when she realized her wool +//. [+ N] 
her local shop didn't have any wool left . 
so they suggested she went straight to the factory . 
and they walked in and there were oh ! 
lots and lots and lots_of different balls of different colored wool . 
and they tracked down the white one „ didn't they ? 
and they got home and all she hadta do was sew it together with the wool she (h)ad bought . 
and what did Pippin do ? 
I don't think Auntie_Mabel was smiling at the time . 
because he got hold of some of the wool and he pulled it and it unraveled . 
all the jumper that she had knitted for her sister . 
ah now you know what this is „ don't you ? 
what's this ? 
no . 
that's not a necklace . 
what's that ? 
it's a watch . 
whose watch is it ? 
Reverand_Tim's ? 
do you not think it's Mummy's watch ? 
do you ? 
no . 
it's Mummy's watch . 
and do you know what that is ? 
no . 
it isn't a watch . 
this is something you put round your wrist . 
shall Mummy put it on to show you ? 
this is a bracelet , Thomas . 
so we've looked at badges (.) brooches (.) necklaces (.) watches . 
and this is (.) something Daddy wears „ isn't it ? 
that's a tie clip . 
keeping Daddy's tie in place . 
oh and you know what this is „ don't you ? 
a ring . 
Mummy's ring . 
look . 
can you see there in the jewelery box there's a special place for rings . 
can you see ? 
ah I don't think this should be in the jewelery box . 
do you know what this is ? 
some money . 
it's some of your toy money .
