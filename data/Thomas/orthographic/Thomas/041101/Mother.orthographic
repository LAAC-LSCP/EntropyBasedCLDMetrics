I know when we went to see (.) Abigail and Sarah at Christmas they had all Bob_the_Builder Play_Doh . 
do you remember ? 
all the bits you could make Bob characters with ? 
and I'd never seen that before and it had been in their shop a long time . 
and I think different &s shops even though it's the same store it's all the Early learning centre I think they stock different things because when we went to Wales she couldn't bring anything we've never seen here before . 
anyway [?] I've seen soft stuff and Play_Doh but I haven't seen these things that you could make characters with . 
now look at this . 
Purdie , don't you be frightened of this .

I was just saying it's not as squishy as the pink . 
when I opened the pink it [//] packet [/] packet felt really funny . 
the green one to me looks a little bit like &-um +... [+ IN]

who's that there ? 
on the floor . 
ooh xxx . [+ PI]
