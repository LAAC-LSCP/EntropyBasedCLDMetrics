into the yellow one (.) that we've just repaired .

there're two horses „ aren't they ? 
I think they might fall out there +//. [+ IN] 
ooh Thomas . 
you haven't fallen over . 
you're just sat on top of me . 
there we are . 
yes . 
right . 
shall we put some animals in the field here ? 
and what about some trees ? 
you are doing funny dances „ aren't you ? 
you're going down a slide . 
there we are . 
there's a little village here . 
look . 
yes you could do . 
there's the church . 
a lot of trees and there're some houses there . 
&-um . 
what ? 
shall we make one of these into the station ? 
is it ? 
is it ? 
oh right . 
it's the doctor's house „ is it ? 
oh right . 
the doctor lives there . 
which doctor ? 
which doctor ? 
the big one ? 
a red one ? 
doc [/] doctor red ? 
I think the trouble is we've got two different sets of houses because the small ones belong to a different set to the train set . 
so the school and church and houses all look much [/] much smaller than the houses that came with the train set . 
yes . 
where would you like to put the traffic signs ? 
near the trains ? 
do you know what the traffic signs say ? 
what do they say ? 
that one says stop . 
yes it's red and white and says stop . 
and the other one says go . 
and what does that one say ? 
yes it means level crossing . 
it means there might (.) be pedestrians walking across . 
it's telling pedestrians that they can walk there safely . 
the wind (h)as blown all the trees over ? 
it is a naughty wind „ isn't it ? 
must have been a very [/] very strong wind actually , Thomas . 
to have blown big trees like that over „ mustn't it ? 
oh Thomas . 
no . 
you've just destroyed the village . 
now with your big hand . 
that wasn't the wind [>] . 
you're a crocodile ? 
the sheep (h)as fallen down and the horse (h)as fallen down . 
yes . 
that was you with your big hand „ wasn't it ? 
you wanna sit down on the floor again ? 
okay . 
you wanna dig something . 
with your digger ? 
shall I find it for you ? 
oh . 
it's snow ? 
no it's too near lunch time , Thomas , for that „ isn't it ? 
well how about digging all the trees that have blown down in the wind . 
don't you ? 
it's too noisy ? 
all the gates have fallen over „ haven't they ? 
the fence . 
the fence that forms the paddock around where the horse and the (.) sheep were . 
that (h)as all blown down in the wind . 
think you're like Bob_The_Builder now . 
you're repairing the fence „ aren't you ? 
no . 
you don't hafta bang everything , Thomas . 
I'm sure Bob does a lot of things during the day where he doesn't bang all the time . 
would you like a tissue ? 
where's your tissue ? 
Bob_The_Builder (h)as got what , love ? 
Bob_The_Builder has got a telephone on board and you've a telephone in your tummy ? 
well that sounds a little bit bizarre . 
a bit far . 
I said bizarre . 
I meant funny strange peculiar . 
dig dig dig . 
oh that's very clever . 
you've picked up one of the trees . 
shall I find the box ? 
there we are . 
you could use this box as a skip . 
and once you've dug up all the trees you could drop them straight into the box „ couldn't you ? 
there we are . 
it's like a big skip . 
are you singing the theme tune from the Tweenies ? 
that's right . 
you've picked up the gates and you're putting the gates in the skip . 
that's a very good way to tidy up this „ isn't it ? 
a big house thing . 
it reminds me of the Tesco clock tower does that , Thomas . 
aw the poor horse . 
that (h)as ended up in the skip as well . 
you're digging some snow but you wanna dig some Smarties ? 
there are a lot more trees „ aren't there ? 
aren't there ? 
and there are also all the traffic signs as well . 
they could be put in the skip . 
oh dear . 
the digger man (h)as lost his load . 
it (h)as all fallen at Mummy's feet . 
it fell before it reached the skip „ didn't it ? 
so you're going to try again ? 
try to make it to the skip this time . 
it's moving . 
yes that's right . 
high up in the air . 
oh well done , digger man . 
aw I'll give him a kiss . 
well done , digger man . 
you're putting the big trees in the skip now „ are you ? 
oh_gosh . 
it must be a big digger to pick a whole church up and put it in the skip . 
little houses . 
they go in the skip as well . 
oh I hope there's no one inside at the time , Thomas . 
what if people are having a little rest after lunch . 
a little sleep . 
like you useta do . 
they'd wake up and find them in the skip with the church the animals and the trees . 
instead of in the village where they were when they went for a lie down . 
oh that would be an awful shock „ wouldn't it ? 
there would be a lot of fire . 
yes . 
a lot of trouble „ wouldn't there ? 
that's right . 
it's another big house with a big red roof . 
is that his last load ? 
and what (h)as he got in there ? 
got lots_of trees and lots_of big sheep in it too . 
one sheep's going in the skip and that's a good job again ? 
well what about all the trains that are on the track ? 
that's a very heavy load if you put all the trains in . 
oh dear the trains have fallen off the track . 
they're all broken . 
oh lots_of fire . 
what a mess . 
taking the trains (.) one by one to the skip . 
it is but it would needta be a big digger , wouldn't it ? 
to do all those jobs . 
I think the poor digger man is working very hard „ isn't he ? 
oh_gosh . 
he (h)as got two trains in this load . 
oh he (h)as lost them . 
oh he (h)as lost them . 
was the digger man turning his head around to see what he was doing ? 
you know „ do you ? 
you were watching as well „ weren't you ? 
yes I was watching [>] . 
another heavy load . 
I was just thinking what an excellent way to tidy up your <train set> [>] . 
you've just opened the track . 
a piece of track came off „ didn't it ? 
two more heavy loads . 
yes . 
there are four more carriages to put in the skip . 
so if we do two together (.) we've got two more loads „ haven't you ? 
a brown one . 
it's a black one actually . 
not a brown one . 
a purple one ? 
no . 
it's black , Thomas . 
well it's like a very very dark blue [>] . 
that's a blue . 
it looks quite +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
I think when you see it against the other blue ones you <can tell it is a black one> [>] . 
yes . 
how many yellow ones . 
it's a heavy load „ isn't it ? 
this one is digging up Krispies ? 
Rice_krispies ? 
dirty Rice_krispies ? 
they're usually quite dirty if you have been playing with them and digging with them „ aren't they ? 
oh that's a clever boy . 
there's just one engine I can still see . 
a green one . 
that's a good boy now . 
what are we going to do with the train track now ? 
are you going to dig them into this big box ? 
this is an even bigger skip „ isn't it ? 
into there . 
oh Thomas . 
you've tipped them all out . 
you (h)ad just picked them up so nicely as well . 
are you going to put the train track into the same skip ? 
it all broken . 
careful , darling . 
be gentle with it . 
that's not nice . 
more heavy loads . 
it's too big to put the whole track in the skip . 
but I think one by one (.) we could do it . 
or how about using the big tractor ? 
look there's the big tractor and trailer there . 
here it is behind you . 
you could put the pieces of track in that . 
I don't think tractors are normally bigger than diggers . 
but your toy ones the tractor seems to be bigger „ doesn't it ? 
oh_gosh . 
the tractor (h)as already got pieces of road in it from the transport jigsaw . 
pieces of tarmac with white lines running down the middle . 
oh well if it can carry that I'm sure it can carry pieces of wooden train track „ don't you ? 
you and the digger man are doing a very good job „ aren't you ? 
now is the farmer helping you with the wooden train track ? 
is he not ? 
oh . 
who is it , Thomas ? 
silly man . 
why [/] why is he a silly man ? 
no . 
I don't either . 
are you just a little bit annoyed because you've been left to do it all ? 
are you a little bit annoyed with the farmer because he (h)as left you to do it all with his tractor ? 
Thomas's not annoyed . 
and the farmer's not annoyed . 
farmer's son get roofs . 
what do you mean ? 
he's putting pieces of roof in his sack ? 
you don't like Postman_Pat ? 
why ? 
I don't know . 
he's nice , Postman_Pat . 
you've always liked him . 
don't you ? 
oh dear . 
there's no pleasing some people . 
you like postmen . 
it's just Postman_Pat you don't like . 
it's a very heavy load in there . 
do you think it's about time you tipped some into the skip ? 
there's going to be a big bang when it all goes into the skip . 
that's right . 
you can take the back of the trailer down „ can't you ? 
shall I do this side ? 
that's it . 
ooh that's a lot of noise as well . 
two pieces . 
the bridges look as if they might be heavy to move . 
do you think they will be ? 
what's funny , love ? 
you're funny . 
why is Thomas funny ? 
is she ? 
what 0are [*] you looking for now ? 
the tractor's traveling round and round with a big wheel and a little wheel ? 
yes there are large wheels at the back and small wheels at the front „ aren't there ? 
oh are you lifting it all out ? 
Thomas . 
that's not nice . 
no . 
that wasn't nice . 
don't throw your toy box . 
you'll break it . 
Thomas ! 
it hasn't broken . 
but if you do that too many times it will . 
and that's silly because you've picked all those things up nicely „ haven't you ? 
you're going to hafta get them all picked up before Daddy comes back . 
otherwise he's going to be cross „ isn't he ?

it's Mr_Tractor . 
is that whose fault it is ? 
what did Mr_Tractor do ? 
throw them all on the floor ? 
you did . 
yes . 
I thought it was you . 
oh Mummy missed Mr_Tractor . 
you're not saying Mr_Tractor but saying I missed it . 
you mean it (h)as gone without me ? 
ah I see that sort of missed . 
missed the tractor . 
it's going last ? 
the green light's on . 
you can see it „ can you ? 
the fire engine light's everywhere ? 
I think it's the lights from the microphones „ isn't it ? 
that you can see . 
just looking in the cupboard to see what medicine we've got , Thomas . 
you want Calpol ? 
ah this is the one I was going to give you . 
this is medicine . 
yes . 
you want Calpol [<] . 
you want this Calpol . 
it's not mint .

open your mouth . 
one two three .

open wide . 
that's right . 
lick the spoon . 
and let's give you another spoonful . 
and this is the end of this bottle but we've got another one in the cupboard „ haven't we ? 
just a minute . 
it's going to take a few minutes for the liquid to run down .

but there looks to be a lot of sugar inside the bottle „ doesn't there ? 
can you see inside ? 
there we are , sweetheart . 
that's right . 
lick the spoon . 
good boy . 
now would you like to finish off with a chocolate to make you feel even more better ? 
even more better . 
that doesn't sound right „ does it ? 
no . 
you can't have any more Calpol . 
oh you look so pale . 
I can't even think what I am trying to say now . 
cough sweets . 
I think I should've said to make you feel even better . 
you've never had cough sweets , Thomas .

have you ? 
do you ? 
make you cough . 
there you are . 
what's that now ?

and [//] look can you see all these different heel heights ? 
these are very tall . 
and these are a little bit tall but not too high . 
and those are fairly flat „ aren't they ? 
they're in your shop ? 
oh so if I came into your shop and asked for a pair of navy blue shoes (.) would you be able to sell me some please ? 
you're a shop lady . 
could I please have a pair of navy blue shoes with a high heel ? 
those ? 
well . 
clever boy . 
clever lady . 
those are the shoes with the highest heel . 
&-um now . 
they are very nice for when I go out in the evening but when I'm walking to Didsbury I could do with something a little bit flatter . 
thank you . 
oh thank you . 
oh right . 
when I'm walking to Didsbury I could do with some that haven't got such a high heel because it's a long walk . 
can I have a pair of navy blue shoes with just a small heel please ? 
&-uh one of those . 
yes . 
yes please . 
oh I don't think they match , Thomas . 
one has a small heel and one has a bigger heel . 
put them on the table and let's have a little look . 
there . 
which ones do you think match ? 
that one matches with (.) which other one ? 
fish Auntie_Frank . 
are you talking about the day you went to the pet shop to buy those two fish ? 
two Auntie_Franks . 
yes they're xxx at that house „ aren't they ? [+ PI] 
but I would still like some more shoes . 
I'll just put the ones that we've paired up into another bag like that . 
and they're different shades of blue „ aren't they , Thomas ? 
that one's quite a light blue and these are dark blue . 
yes please . 
can I have a pair of navy blue ones please ? 
yes . 
that one's fine . 
as long as there's a matching one . 
it is but they don't match „ do they ? 
do you think this one goes with this one ? 
and do you think this one goes with that one ? 
there's another clue as well . 
look at the inside of the shoe . 
what color's that inside ? 
it's blue inside . 
and what color are these shoes inside ? 
purple ? 
they're cream „ aren't they ? 
or beige . 
or brown . 
that's right . 
we can put them into pairs now . 
that's lovely . 
you're a shop man . 
a clever man . 
well [//] oh please can I have this pair ? 
shall I pay you for them ? 
there you are . 
<that's> [//] how much would you like ?

shall I give you a twenty pound note ? 
there we are . 
and [/] and I'll be getting some change „ won't I ?

don't worry about a bag . 
they'll go in this one . 
oh that's lovely .

well shall I pay you for these ? 
how much would you like for them ? 
two pounds ? 
oh that's a pound a pair . 
that's a pound each . 
a pound a shoe . 
that's lovely . 
I wonder why I'm throwing all these out , Thomas . 
there must be some reason . 
perhaps they're not very comfortable . 
oh yes . 
I've tried them on . 
thank you very very much . 
strange . 
something very strange is happening . 
yes . 
there we are . 
will they go in this carrier bag please , Mr shop man ? 
oh that's lovely . 
thank you so much . 
bye bye . 
I'll see you again .

I'm just looking at this because there's a little book here called “the little opposite book” . 
oh you're a book man now „ are you ? 
there you are . 
do you work in the library or the bookshop ? 
a bookshop . 
well I found a little book here that I like the look of . 
it's called opposites@q . 
because we were just matching shoes together in pairs „ weren't we ? 
so the same things matched . 
but all these things in this book are things that don't match . 
they are opposite . 
this is a picture of two hippopotamuses . 
if there is such a phrase . 
one's in the water . 
one's +... [+ IN] 
out of the water . 
one's in .

a penguin . 
and look there's some ice and snow . 
that's not hot „ is it ? 
is it cold ? 
one's hot . 
one's warm . 
warm . 
what happens when you're near snow ? 
do you feel warm or do you feel cold ? 
you feel warm „ do you ? 
well you would because we'd be sitting by the fire „ wouldn't we ? 
no . 
the alligator [//] crocodile is hot . 
and the penguin's cold . 
the sun and the snow . 
two opposites that don't match . 
thank you very much Mr_Bookman . 
ooh there's a picture here of two +... [+ IN] 
monkeys . 
and they've each got hold of +... [+ IN] 
banana . 
so they're the same „ aren't they ? 
but they're swinging from the trees . 
do you remember the song about “three little monkeys” . 
so the two cheeky monkeys swinging in the tree . [+ R] 
one's going up and the other's going +... [+ IN] [+ R] 
down . 
so they're not doing the same thing „ are they ? 
they're opposite .

that's quite clever , Thomas . 
the elephant's large „ isn't he ? 
the mouse is tiny . 
and it says big and +... [+ IN] 
big and small . 
big and small . 
but they're both grey „ aren't they ? 
they've both got pink ears . 
on the picture . 
oh that's very nice .

it's a big and little book . 
you'd like to just turn the page over . 
yes . 
picture of another elephant ? 
yes . 
that's right . 
it says “some animals are big” .

it's showing a giraffe and elephant which are big and a cat and a dog which are small . 
all gone . 
right . 
these are nice books . 
do you sell these books in your bookshop ? 
&-um could I have a look at the little shape and color book ? 
please , Sir . 
and see what's in this book . 
an orange circle and a +... 
no .

and a blue tube . 
is it more like a Smartie tube ? 
pink rectangle . 
and what else have you got ?

what color's the triangle ? 
it's not red . 
what color's the triangle ? 
the green triangle . 
and what color is the star ? 
yellow .
