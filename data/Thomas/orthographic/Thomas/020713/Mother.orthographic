helicopter's usually sleep in very big sheds called hangers . 
aircrafts are kept in very big sheds called hangers .

oh what happens if you get milk all down your dressing gown ? 
<because your dressing> [>] +... [+ IN] 
I'll hafta wash it ?

because it takes a long time to dry . 
it's made from very thick material . 
look . 
feel it . 
excuse me . 
oh excuse me please , Thomas . 
farty pants smell disgusting ? 
all I did was sneeze , Thomas . 
well I know you say “poo smells disgusting” because of that little book we like to read . 
about the doggy . 
it's a story about a dog who jumps into a ditch when he's out for a walk . 
and he gets very muddy and dirty . 
then his owner said “poo you smell disgusting” . 
<but I don't know> [<] why you say farty pants . 
that's not nice .

that's not nice calling people that , Thomas .

well talking of buss , Thomas . 
what we're going to do today +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
we are . 
as soon as we've finished playgroup we're going to get on a bus and go to Stockport . 
because when we're at playgroup we're halfway to Stockport anyway . 
and we've got to dash round the shops . 
because we've got to buy a present for Fred and Rachael's baby next door . 
for little Miles . 
Miles is only four pounds . 
he's a tiny [/] tiny baby . 
he's in a special cot „ isn't he ? 
in the hospital . 
so we've got to buy <him something> [>] . 
mhm . 
and then Jane's baby . 
Daddy's friend . 
Jane had a baby . 
we've got to buy a card and a present for her . 
so we needta dash into Stockport . 
because yesterday when we went in Mothercare was shut „ wasn't it ? 
the shops we wanted to go in were shut because of stock taking . 
and one thing or another so +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
poor Mummy . 
I wasn't very pleased „ was I ?

or are you going to see Jo and Becky ? 
you wanna go and see Jo and Becky ? 
you like playing there „ don't you ? 
what's their dog called ? 
Sooty . 
I think Sooty's having her hair cut actually today . 
I think there's a lady going to Jo's house to cut Sooty's hair . 
oh , Thomas . 
that was a big sneeze . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
are you alright ? 
pardon ? 
have a sweetie ? 
who are you asking to have a sweetie ? 
oh Sooty . 
oh why does Sooty the dog get some sweets ? 
does Jo give him sweets ? 
or her sweets ? 
I never know whether Sooty's a girl or a boy . 
what is Sooty ? 
a little girl or a little boy dog ? 
no . 
is he a little boy or a little girl dog ? 
a girl dog . 
mhm . 
I think she probably is . 
I'm not sure though . 
I can never remember . 
oh Mummy needs to set the video this morning „ doesn't she ? 
pardon ? 
the song video ? 
I'll go and do +/. [+ IN] 
I'll go and do it now while I remember . 
the Tweenies ? 
you want me to tape www . 
because we're not often in now „ are we ? 
to watch these things . 
but if we've got them on tape you can watch them later on „ can't you ? 
right , Thomas . 
I'll see if I can do it . 
I always press the wrong button . 
Auntie_Mabel and Pippin . 
that's your favorite „ isn't it ? 
Jo's dog Sooty is like Auntie_Mabel's Pippin . 
is Alice barking . 
oh . 
well I can't hear her . 
well the postman (h)as been this morning „ hasn't he ? 
<so I don't think> [<] she can be barking at the postman . 
you telling Alice to stop ? 
I can't hear her , Thomas . 
is she really barking ? 
what's on the television now ? 
Pippin again ? 
I'll sit next to you and then I can see it so we know what's going on . 
boots ? 
do you think it's a program about boots ? 
oh Wellington boots . 
can you see from here ? 
what are those ? 
red ones ? 
red Wellington boots ? 
it's raining . 
look . 
on the television . 
the boots are getting wet „ aren't they ? 
Auntie_Mabel's is wearing green ones . 
that's what you like to do „ isn't it ? 
splash in the puddles . 
well Pippin's probably splashing in the puddle as well . 
a ginger cat ? 
what's the ginger cat doing ? 
is it saying meow ? 
no ? 
we can't hear it „ can we ? 
we can only see the television pictures . 
it looks to me as if Pippin has gone in a puddle and got wet . 
so what's Auntie_Mabel doing to him ? 
washing her ? 
she's rubbing her down with a towel „ isn't she ? 
you know when you get out of the bath at night ? 
you hair's wet „ isn't it ? 
what does Mummy do with the towel ? 
rub it . 
that's right . 
I rub it . 
I rub it till it's dry . 
and then after you've got clean pyjamas on we get a brush . 
and we <brush brush> [/] [<] brush your hair nicely . 
what's Auntie_Mabel doing ? 
I don't know . 
it looks as if her socks have got wet . 
she's taking her socks off and drying her feet „ isn't she ? 
getting them clean ? 
her Wellingtons look dirty „ don't they ? 
you've been enjoying walking through the crunchy leaves „ haven't you ? 
but they're a bit wet now „ aren't they ? 
well it looks like they've going out for another walk „ doesn't it ? 
I don't know whether the rain (h)as stopped . 
but she (h)as not got her Wellingtons on again . 
oh . 
or perhaps (.) I bet she was walking in a puddle with her Wellingtons and there was a hole in her Wellington boot . 
and that's why her foot got wet . 
is that right do you think ? 
what's missing ? 
one of your train carriages ? 
well are you going to finish eating your Cornflakes . 
where can you see it ? 
on the floor ? 
would you like me to pick it up for you ? 
pardon ? 
there you are . 
you finish the rest of your Cornflakes . 
oh , Thomas . 
you're sneezing now . 
Mummy was sneezing before . 
we haven't got colds . 
I think it just &-um (.) something we do in the morning „ isn't it ? 
let's have a sneeze . 
now are you doing an impression of Mummy sneezing ? 
or are you just sneezing on your own ? 
there you are . 
that's the little train you're missing . 
there's the missing carriage . 
would you like some bread , Thomas ? 
or some toast ? 
shall we have a piece of toast this morning ? 
might help warm us up . 
a nice piece of warm toast . 
or hot toast . 
and then we can have a banana „ can't we ? 
do you not wanna talk this morning , Thomas ? 
ah you're not going to talk to Mummy ? 
big crocodile ? 
where's the big crocodile ? 
where ? 
you're pointing to yourself . 
are you a big crocodile ? 
oh goodness . 
I (h)ad better be careful then „ hadn't I ? 
well that looks as if it's a machine that perhaps makes Wellington boots . 
because it's a big machine rolling what looks to be some green material . 
perhaps rubber or vinyl . 
something like that . 
I bet they make a pair of Wellington boots . 
but it's a little bit difficult , Thomas . 
because we haven't got the sound on „ have we ? 
so we can't really tell what's happening . 
we've got to just guess . 
but we've got quite a lot of things on today „ haven't we ? 
so we really needta +/. [+ IN] 
what's missing now , sweetheart ? 
no . 
you've only got four carriages . 
you've got three carriages and an engine in the wooden train set . 
I don't think there's another one missing , poppet . 
<no no> [/] no . 
yes there is ? 
whoops a daisy . 
what can you see now ? 
do you think they're making Wellington boots ? 
you've got some Wellington boots „ haven't you ?

Dipsy [/] Dipsy . 
you've worn the Wellingtons a lot „ haven't you ? 
this time last year , Thomas . 
I don't know whether you can remember . 
but Mummy and you +... [+ IN] 
<Mummy and you> [//] Mummy and Thomas were both in the Lake_District . 
we were staying for a few days „ weren't we ? 
I don't know whether you remember that . 
but you useta wear your <Wellingtons a lot> [>] . 
what's happening ? 
well it looks as if the man has made all those new Wellingtons . 
and he (h)as put them in a big rack . 
like a trolley . 
and he's pushing it along the warehouse . 
all those Wellingtons . 
they'll probably end up going to a shop . 
and then people like you and me go in and buy them . 
in fact you're +//. [+ IN] 
oh xxx that the toaster ? [+ PI] 
it sounds like it's about to blow up . 
<one of these days> [<] it will , Thomas . 
and it will give us such a shock . 
mm . 
the toast smells nice . 
your Wellingtons actually are getting a little bit small . 
they're fine at the moment . 
but I think perhaps we'll hafta see at Christmas about getting you some more . 
because at Christmas time there might be some snow . 
or it might be very wet . 
and you might need something on your feet that doesn't slip . 
and keeps your feet dry . 
the trouble with Wellington boots they're not very warm . 
you've got to wear lots_of thick socks . 
oh what (h)as Pippin got in his mouth ? 
a Wellington . 
but it's a little Wellington „ isn't it ? 
especially for Pippin . 
little red Wellington . 
oh they're back out in the rain again . 
no . 
Pippin hasn't got Wellingtons „ has he ? 
not on his paws . 
is he going to get wet paws ? 
Auntie_Mabel (h)as got her new green ones on „ hasn't she ? 
oh ! 
who's that ? 
Fireman_Sam ? 
it's a fireman . 
what's the fireman doing ? 
getting dressed ? 
ready to go to a fire ? 
he's putting Wellingtons on „ isn't he ? 
and who's that ? 
a fisherman ? 
that's a fisher . 
he (h)as got extremely long Wellingtons „ hasn't he ? 
oh bother , Thomas . 
we've burnt the toast . 
burnt . 
yes . 
they're burnt . 
<tell me> [>] +... [+ IN] 
oh it's not dirty . 
it's just very black „ isn't it ? 
on one side . 
what I'll do . 
I'll have that piece . 
and I'll slice another piece for Thomas_Henry . 
that's because it wasn't ready when it popped up . 
so Mummy pushed it down for another second . 
and then I was too busy looking at the fireman and the fisherman . 
and forgot all about it . 
we nearly needed Fireman_Sam then to come and put the toast out „ didn't we ? 
Fireman_Sam ? 
has the fireman gone now ? 
I think they were just showing you what sort of Wellingtons the fireman wore . 
he didn't have green Wellingtons like Auntie_Mabel „ did he ? 
oh yes . 
that's a little fireman . 
is it a story about a fireman ? 
no . 
you can do without the fireman for a meal , Thomas . 
can't we ? 
it's better if we don't hafta call the fireman out . 
who else wears Wellingtons ? 
Purdie [>] ? 
oh yes . 
there's the ginger pussy cat . 
look . 
in our garden . 
he (h)as not got Wellingtons on „ has he ? 
the ginger pussy cat (h)as been frightening Sue's cat Smudge . 
she told me yesterday that Smudge had been really upset because the ginger pussy cat (h)as upset him . 
big dog ? 
Granddad wears Wellingtons . 
both sets of Granddad's have Wellingtons for when they're in the garden „ don't they ? 
Daddy has some Wellingtons . 
he doesn't very often wear his . 
and Mummy (h)as got Wellingtons . 
and I don't <often wear> [>] mine . 
a cat ? 
<oh yes> [<] . 
that's a ginger cat on the television with the big dog . 
a little mouse ? 
what's the nursery rhyme you know where they talk about a little mouse ? 
pussy cat [/] pussy cat where have you been ? [+ R] 
and that ends up with I frightened +... [+ IN] 
frightened a little mouse a chair ? 
I frightened a little mouse under her chair . [+ R]

and I haven't burnt this slice . 
that's better „ isn't it ? 
this bit isn't quite so black . 
who (h)as fallen down ? 
a fireman fell down ? 
oh I can't see now because I'm buttering the toast . 
so you'll hafta tell me what's happening . 
oh . 
I don't know , darling . 
we can't hear the sound „ can we ? 
poor Mummy ?

is that toast nice ?

it's not . 
it's Sue's car . 
it's Sue's neighbor . 
who's also called Sue . 
and she (h)as got a big red car „ hasn't she ? 
what are you pointing to ? 
big bees ? 
is it storytime now ? 
you're going to storytime at playgroup „ aren't you ? 
scarecrows ? 
well last week there was a story about a scarecrow . 
and we sing about a scarecrow at music lessons „ don't we ? 
I don't think they'll be music group again though . 
because Julian's still not very well „ is he ? 
he's a poorly man . 
what's going to bite Mummy ? 
the train engine ? 
don't bang , Thomas . 
what are you doing ? 
making fishes ?

don't bang .

would you like a banana .

<you're doing that> [>] . 
oh I see . 
you're doing that to frighten the ginger cat „ are you ?

because +/. [+ IN] 
bonfire night and when there are fireworks about you're sposta keep pets inside „ aren't you ? 
but unfortunately the +/. [+ IN] 
don't bang . 
the ginger cat isn't looked after very well . 
and his owner's didn't bother keeping him in . 
so when there were fireworks going off the poor ginger cat was left outside „ wasn't he ? 
he was frightened . 
so I think that's why you're saying frighten ginger cat pretending to be a firework . 
yes . 
he was somewhere outside „ wasn't he ? 
there you are . 
there's a nice banana for you . 
yes . 
I'll take the skin off for you . 
put the peel away . 
what (h)as it got on it ? 
yellow juice ? 
oh it's just the end of the banana , Thomas . 
it's just quite ripe . 
there's nothing the matter with it . 
Mummy (h)as just remembered that we had a (.) bag through the door the other day asking if we (h)ad got any old clothes and shoes <and things> [>] . 
well just eat your banana first , Thomas . 
do you not want your banana ? 
what do you want ? 
<no no> [/] no . 
I don't like you banging , Thomas . 
it's not nice . 
no [<] . 
now you watch Mummy . 
we've got two pairs of shoes here . 
two pairs of shoes which Mummy doesn't want . 
and we'll put them in the bag (.) like that . 
one pair of shoes and one pair of sandals . 
<and I'll tie them up> [>] . 
tie them up there . 
and then we've got a skirt (.) that Mummy can't get into anymore <because I xxx > [>] . [+ PI] 
oh no . 
don't mess with it , Thomas . 
if you don't wanna eat it we'll put it away till lunchtime . 
well you've put your finger straight through . 
and made a mess of it . 
the banana looks silly „ doesn't it ? 
look at this bright colored skirt . 
can you see that ? 
can you see all these little checks ? 
little squares ? 
they're called checks . 
and Mummy can't get into that anymore . 
so we'll put that in the bag . 
along with this little jumper <or little sweatshirt> [>] . 
now you useta wear this „ didn't you ? 
but it's far too small for you now . 
so I think we'll put that in the bag as well , Thomas . 
<no you're making too much noise> [<] . 
xxx . 
yes . 
in a second we can <sit down> [?] . 
just let's put these two bags into the pink bag that came through the door . 
and then the man can collect it . 
look . 
it's the big pink bag , Thomas . 
and it's says “we urgently need clothing books household items etcetera” .

it's a dog . 
but it's poorly . 
it (h)as got a walking stick and a bandage on his foot . 
and a plaster on his nose . 
look on this bag .

it's a big picture of the dog . 
what's the dog called ?

all these things that we send will go to a shop and other people buy them . 
and any money that's made it goes to poorly animals . 
mhm . 
yes . 
<they &pr> [//] they have a little ambulance . 
I'm sure .

that doesn't needta go . 
you can keep that . 
<so when a> [<] +... [+ IN]

don't put the plastic xxx in there . [+ PI] 
and then when animals are poorly . 
like Purdie .

but then it's going straight outside . 
it's a big pink bag „ isn't it ? 
a lot of things . 
well let's put it outside of the door . 
and then when the big white van comes we can watch him pick it up „ can't we ? 
put it outside of the front door . 
because we take Purdie to the vet's „ don't we ? 
when she's not well . 
but there are some animals when they're injured and nobody knows who the owner's are . 
so they +/. [+ IN] 
they go to the vet's <and nobody wants to> [>] +... [+ IN] 
just a moment . 
and nobody wants to pay for them to get better . 
but &-um +/. [+ IN]

hold the lid ? 
that's the lid for that box . 
there you are .

well you didn't wanna put it on , Thomas . 
come on . 
don't be a silly boy . 
why are you getting so upset ? 
there we are . 
let's rinse your hand .

not do it ? 
what's broken ? 
the train've fallen down ?

let's just finish washing your hands .

you poked a hole in the banana .

oh Tommy_Ticklemouse . 
poor Tommy_Tickemouse . 
do you remember this morning on Storytime there was that story called “Guess how much I love you” ? 
it was about the big brown hare „ wasn't it ? 
a hare is a bit like a rabbit . 
but it (h)as got really long ears . 
can you see how long the ears are ? 
and we've never actually bought the book Guess how much I love you . 
but (.) last year we were given a calendar . 
a calendar with the Guess how much I love you story written on it . 
so we'll have a look at . 
a big brown hare . 
look . 
this is a calendar , Thomas . 
and every month +//. [+ IN] 
these are the days of the week +//. [+ IN] 
and the day . 
January . 
it says on the top Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday . 
what are those ? 
numbers ? 
they're the days of the week „ aren't they ?

one two three four . 
right up to number thirty one . 
so every month you've got days of the week .

days of the week . 
and dates of the week .

so we'll go through the calendar . 
and we'll read the story . 
we'll start at January . 
“guess how much I love you” said little nut brown hare . [+ R] 
“oh I don't think I could guess that” said big nut brown hare . [+ R] 
which one's little nut brown hare ?

“I love you this much” said little nut brown hare stretching out his arms as wide as they could go . [+ R] 
where's wide , Thomas ? 
you show me wide . 
stretch out your arms .

you look like a scarecrow now . 
right . 
let's move onto March . 
“I love you this much” said big nut brown hare . [+ R]

do you remember seeing that pond yesterday when we went out for our walk ? 
it was just water „ wasn't it ? 
do you remember ? 
not see ?

because you said there were no ducks on it .

and do you love Mummy very much ? 
no ? 
oh poor Mummy . 
you must love Mummy <a little bit> [>] . 
noisy boy . 
do you not love Mummy a little bit ? 
you're so cheeky . 
you do love Mummy „ don't you ? 
why are you laughing ? 
you're joking ? 
“I'm joking” is that what you said ? 
<I'm joking> [>] . 
you're being noisy . 
you're blowing into your juice bottle . 
so when you say I'm joking do you mean you do love Mummy really ? 
oh , Thomas . 
oh .

not like Mummy ?

there are times that I get very [/] very frustrated with you . 
<and I get very cross and I shout> [<] . 
but I always [/] always love you .

<yes you are> [<] . 
I tell you what , Thomas . 
I don't love that noise .

I don't love that noise at all . 
why +//. [+ IN] 
there are no lids on either of these bottles . 
what have you done with them ? 
<lot of sun shining> [<] ? 
well there are only two empty bottles of sunny delight „ aren't there ?

they've got a picture of sun . 
so we'll hafta go back now , Thomas . 
and put this calendar back on the wall „ won't we ? 
<we've gone> [<] through January February March . 
April May June July August September October . 
no lids on the bottles .

+" I love you right up to the moon . [+ R] 
little nut brown hare says and closed his eyes . [+ R]

yes . 
Mummy do it . 
what would you like me to do ? 
find some lids ? 
yes please ? 
okay . 
you're having a sleep ? 
look we found some more things that can go in the bag outside . 
two scarfs and a belt . 
well they're going in the [/] the bag „ aren't they ? 
that we're collecting . 
it's the blue belt . 
look . 
it useta go on one of Mummy's skirts and it useta fit round Mummy's tummy . 
and look . 
oh ! 
the belt won't fit anymore „ will it ? 
because Mummy is too big . 
<Mummy useta> [>] +//. [+ IN] 
oops be careful . 
Mummy useta be very slim and she's not anymore . 
oh dear . 
look . 
you've got a belt on your dressing gown „ haven't you ? 
see if it'll go round your tummy , Thomas . 
I think +/. [+ IN] 
look . 
this is your belt . 
sometimes dressing gowns have little cords . 
not belts . 
and they're called cords . 
with tassles on the end . 
they're called cords rather than belts . 
but yours is a definite belt „ isn't it ? 
and this is a belt . 
this is a very wide belt . 
what color is it ? 
it's blue . 
is it light blue or dark blue ? 
no . 
you're dressing gown is dark blue . 
this is +... [+ IN] 
light blue . 
or [<] . 
or pale blue . 
pale blue . 
look . 
your bean bag with the Teletubbies on it . 
oh , Thomas . 
be careful . 
you're falling out of the chair . 
look . 
your bean bag that's +//. [+ IN] 
is this light blue or dark blue ? 
no . 
it's light blue . 
what color's your dressing gown ? 
it's not black . 
it's dark blue . 
it's navy blue . 
they're all blue but they're all different <shades of> [>] blue „ aren't they ? 
right . 
so I'll roll this belt up now . 
put it in a bag . 
and I shall just go outside . 
you can watch me „ can't you ? 
put this in the pink bag . 
whoops . 
xxx go outside . [+ PI] 
the man in the white van hasn't picked this bag up yet „ has he ? 
so I can bring it inside . 
undo it . 
untie the knot that we put in the top . 
I thought he might have been here by now . 
sometimes +/. [+ IN] 
I've not heard him . 
I've not seen him either . 
you've not heard him either ? 
have you heard him ? 
the sun shining now ? 
yes . 
it is . 
<it's not &-um> [//] it's very cold outside [?] . 
<it's a cold> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
oh that looks like a Cornflake . 
was that in your dressing gown pocket ? 
you're eating it now . 
there we are . 
I'll go and put this bag back outside . 
do you think the van will see that when he comes ? 
do you think when the man comes he will see that Thomas ? 
yes ? 
I think he will . 
what's happening ? 
well are the lights still working ? 
orange and green ? 
no red one ? 
there should be a red one there . 
I think it's because the sun's shining on it . 
you can't see it very well . 
is that right ? 
pardon ? 
what about Sonia and Isabelle ? 
you heard them talking ? 
heard +//. [+ IN] 
don't stand on that , sweetheart . 
please . 
it'll break . 
what [/] what are you saying you've heard , Thomas ? 
Sonia and Isabelle ? 
who's out there ? 
who's down +//. [+ IN] 
no . 
you mustn't stand on that . 
it'll break . 
look . 
it's not for standing on , Thomas . 
apart from it breaking you +/. [+ IN] 
look . 
you can look at it but you mustn't stand on it . 
Dimitra's tape's in there ? 
yes . 
well don't start messing with them otherwise when <Dimitra comes to pick them up> [<] +... [+ IN] 
is there tapes ? 
yes . 
she (h)as brought tapes and batterys . 
and spare tapes and batterys . 
so we've got a lot of things „ haven't we ? 
no . 
that's not Dimitra's . 
that's Daddy's remote control „ isn't it ? 
Daddy's and Thomas's . 
yes . 
you share it with him . 
it does look a little bit like a telephone . 
it looks like a mobile phone „ doesn't it ? 
but it's not . 
it is the television remote control . 
right . 
are we going to put things back now ? 
because otherwise when Dimitra comes to pick her tapes up (.) we won't know where they are „ will we ? 
and she'll be cross . 
do you think she'll be cross ? 
pressing the buttons there ? 
well just be careful what you press . 
because you might end up setting the tape recorder and then we might record something we don't wanna watch . 
or you might tape on top of Auntie_Mabel and Pippin . 
and that would be upsetting „ wouldn't it ?
