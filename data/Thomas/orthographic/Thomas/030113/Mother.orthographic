we can't read it . 
that's not a book we can read , Thomas . 
it's not a book that we can read together . 
let's read this one . 
because you liked this one <at toddler group> [>] . 
don't you ? 
why did you say it was scary ? 
were you scared when Mummy read it ?

do you remember at activity time you went into +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
they said you could eat them . 
you put icing on the biscuits and decorated them with Smarties and all sorts of little marshmallows . 
and then we walked home with Jo and Becky „ didn't we ? 
and Becky wanted to eat hers „ didn't she ? 
then [>] +... [+ IN]

Casey who's two . 
and everybody sang Happy_Birthday (.) but he didn't wanna blow his candles out „ did he ? 
well (.) you know when it was your birthday you didn't wanna blow your candles out „ did you ? 
but you wanted to help Casey blow his out today „ didn't you ? 
so we sang Happy_Birthday and what did you do ? 
the boy did it on his own ? 
oh I think you helped him . 
there were a few of you helped him . 
and when we (h)ad finished the story (.) because it was a story about some teddy bears in the wood (.) Mummy thought it would be a good idea to sing Teddy_Bear's_Picnic . 
and I said “come along who knows teddy bear's picnic” . 
and they all said “no (.) we don't” . 
and a few said “yes (.) we do” . 
so we [/] we sang it „ didn't we ? 
we gave it a try . 
and they did know it „ didn't they ? 
then at the end of the story did everyone clap ? 
I think the children liked the story [>] .

first of all we said Happy_Birthday to Casey „ didn't we ?

and if you're ready for a story say +... [+ IN] [+ R]

if you're ready for a story say shh@q . [+ R] 
if you're ready for a story and you really wanna hear it . [+ R] 
if you're ready for a story say shh@q . [+ R] 
and then we read the story . 
and it's this story „ isn't it ? 
where's my teddy ? 
Eddie (h)as lost his teddy , Freddie . [+ R] 
so off he goes to the wood to find him . [+ R] 
but the wood is dark and horrible . [+ R] 
and little Eddie is in for a gigantic surprise . [+ R]

he tip toed on and on until something made him stop quite still . [+ R] 
“look out” he thought . [+ R]

how did you get to be this size ? [+ R] 
you're too big to have huddle [?] and cuddle he said . [+ R] 
and I'll never fit both of us into my bed . [+ R] 
then out of the darkness clearer and clearer the sound of a sobbing came nearer and nearer . [+ R] 
soon the whole wood could hear the sound of the bawl . [+ R] 
+" how did you get to be tiddly@d and small ? [+ R] 
“you're too small to huddle and cuddle” it said . [+ R] 
and you'll only get lost in my giant sized bed . [+ R]

“my ted(dy)” gasped the bear . [+ R]

“a boy” yelled the bear . [+ R] 
and they ran and they ran through the dark wood back to their homes as quick as they could . [+ R] 
all the way back to their snuggly beds . [+ R] 
where they huddled <and cuddled> [>1] their own [>2] little ted(dy) . [+ R] 
ah .

I huddle and cuddle you „ don't I ? 
oh that was a big kiss . 
isn't that a nice story ? 
then at the end of the story everybody gave us a clap . 
then we sang +//. [+ IN] 
oh then we talked about Freddie because I held up your teddy bear and I said “this is Fred” . 
this is Freddie who Thomas takes to bed . 
and the other children told me what they took to bed . 
do you remember that little girl who said she took her dog to bed ? 
what's [<] her name ? 
I don't know what her name's called . 
I'll <ask her> [//] asked her what her dog was called but she didn't tell me . 
she said it was a spotty dog . 
one or two of the little boys at the front said yes they had teddy bears that they took to bed . 
I don't know , darling . 
I don't know anybody's name . 
I know +//. [+ IN] 
the people that we knew weren't sitting at the front . 
they were all sitting on chairs at the back . 
then we sang teddy bears picnic . 
and look . 
this is the list of songs . 
baa baa black sheep . 
twinkle twinkle little star . 
that says Fred . 
because it was to remind me to talk <about Fred> [>] .

along came a crocodile as sneaky as can be . [+ R] 
<and snap> [<] went the crocodile . [+ R]

left leg . 
and whole self „ didn't we ? 
some flash cards . 
do you wanna look at those ? 
it's a packet of flash cards . 
so did you enjoy the story ? 
<you did at the time „ didn't you> [>] ? 
pardon ? 
it's not a police car . 
that's a picture of a nurse . 
n@l for nurse . 
it's a boy ? 
I think you'll find it's a little girl . 
what are those ? 
they're building bricks .

he's looking after animals who are all poorly . 
the teddy bear has a bandage on his ear . 
the duck has a plaster on him . 
the monkey has a bandage . 
they're all poorly animals . 
so who looks after poorly animals ? 
Thomas does ? 
what about the v@l <e@l t@l> [>] ? 
a lion ! 
oh I can see that's a nice lion „ isn't it ? 
yeah . 
that's l@l for lion . 
what else can you see ? 
a house . 
how many windows has the house got ? 
two [<] windows . 
where's the top ones ? 
that's very clever . 
no . 
the house only has two [/] two windows „ doesn't it ? 
perhaps it's a cottage . 
sometimes cottages &-uh (.) <you remember> [//] do you remember going to see Monica and Paul in York ? 
Paul's a policeman . 
well his wife Monica +/. [+ IN] 
a cup ? 
it's m@l for a mug . 
his wife useta live in a cottage . 
and it had an upstairs but the [/] the upstairs windows were at the back . 
the front of the cottage only had windows at the bottom . 
so perhaps it's Monica's cottage . 
or it could be +/. [+ IN] 
do I want a letter ? 
oh yes . 
I'd love one please . 
<it [/] it could be> [<] a bungalow .

upstairs [<] . 
an umbrella . 
yes . 
is that my letter ? 
thank you .

did you not enjoy nursery , Thomas ? 
oh why ?

your voice is (.) weird [>] again . 
oh well that's b@l for a ball . 
oh I thought perhaps c@l [/] c@l was near it . 
ah no (.) look . 
c@l is for carrot . 
that looks like a marzipan carrot . 
it does . 
but can you see the difference between a cup and a mug ? 
a mug is tall (.) you don't need a saucer . 
a cup needs a saucer . 
which is probably why we don't xxx with cups . [+ PI] 
I'm Mummy . 
I'm hanging the cup back . 
do you wanna feed these pussy cats now , Thomas ? 
Purdie's food ?
