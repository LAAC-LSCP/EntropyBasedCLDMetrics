are you going to do some running around ? 
Mummy's just going upstairs , Thomas .

no [x 3] . 
I should think not , Thomas . 
come on . 
<back to here> [/] back to her please . 
I don't understand where all your clean vests have gone to , Thomas . 
because I remember standing +/. [+ IN]

you obviously didn't get that +/. [+ IN] 
+, quite in time . [+ IN] 
oh it's a bit of mess . 
it doesn't matter . 
<it never matters , Thomas> [//] it never matters , sweetheart . 
because we can always get you cleaned up .

have you seen some men outside ? 
I can tell you who I can see coming now .

I think that's called a dumper truck . 
there's the snowplow the digger a dumper truck a cement mixer . 
I don't think Bob_The_Builder has one of these on the building site but it's the same type of toy . 
it's a helicopter . 
shall we put these trousers on <instead of the shorts> [>] . 
yes . 
Grandma bought you that „ didn't she ? 
we bought that the day you went to see Grandma . 
and you played with it at Grandma's house „ didn't you ? 
the helicopter . 
do you remember seeing Grandma and Granddad ? 
do you remember going to York to see Grandma and Granddad ? 
did you have a nice tea at their house ? 
because <when you go> [//] you see Daddy's Mummy and Daddy each week „ don't you ? 
but you don't see Mummy's Mummy and Daddy very often „ do you ? 
is that the cement mixer going round ? 
what's the cement mixer called ? 
Dizzy ? 
is the mixer called Dizzy because he goes round and round and round and gets Dizzy ? 
he's all in a spin „ isn't he ? 
po@c trucks .

so I think you better come down . 
yes yes yes yes . 
steady because you'll fall , Thomas . 
come on . 
yes . 
but the choo_choos@f aren't going to go on the table „ are they ?

yes . 
and Purdie's sitting underneath a table outside „ isn't she ? 
what else could I see ?

can you see the window+cleaner ? 
the window+cleaner is cleaning the windows . 
can you see that man up there ? 
oh yes . 
the man's on some steps . 
are you telling him to get down ? 
he's probably quite safe , Thomas . 
because he's useta climbing on ladders . 
he's the window+cleaner . 
if he +/. [+ IN] 
it's the window+cleaner . 
what's he doing ? 
washing the windows . 
that's right . 
he's getting down from his ladder now „ isn't he ? 
byebye , steps . 
look . 
he's moving his ladder along to the house next door . 
you'll probably see the ladder go up to the window in a minute and then he'll start climbing back up the ladder . 
if he's cleaning the windows of the house opposite +/. [+ IN] 
+, he'll probably come to see us tomorrow or the day after because they always clean that way before ours „ don't they . [+ IN] 
Bow . 
Mummy's blowing her nose a lot this morning . 
it's running . 
yes . 
that's the planter that Mummy bought to put some herbs in . 
and the other day we were playing outside with it „ weren't we ? 
putting some stones in and out . 
and then the rain fell down and a lot of the water collected in the compartments and we saw Purdie leaning into it and drinking some water „ didn't we ? 
Bow juice . 
yes . 
she was drinking water from the plant pot . 
she must have been very thirsty .

choo_choos@f wada@c . 
I'll pass you the train .

you don't want them all , Thomas . 
no . 
<oh Thomas , you've got a train> [//] Thomas , you have a train a trailer a digger a dumper truck .

no . 
that will do .

that will do . 
right . 
well if you don't want them let's put them over here . 
Thomas , you've got a terrible temper . 
hey . 
that will do . 
listen . 
the only reason the train fell on the floor is because you have a bad temper and you knocked it on the ground . 
now just calm down . 
Thomas , what's the matter ? 
what do you want ? 
which one ? 
well I don't [//] really don't know what happened to it . 
what have you done with it , Thomas ? 
oh it's here behind you . 
so all that fuss and actually all you want is the train . 
there you are . 
I'm sure sausage roll tastes better when it's riding around in the back of a train . 
I don't know what we're going to do with you . 
Thomas , I don't know what you want . 
there we are . 
Thomas , <it's all for you> [/] it's all for you .

where you saying Nin_Nin xxx ? [+ PI] 
Thomas , listen ! 
it's the telephone .

and whoever it was didn't leave a message „ did they ? 
no . 
<it wasn't> [//] well it might have been Daddy on the phone but Daddy usually leaves a message „ doesn't he ? 
so I don't know who it was . 
yes . 
what on earth is the matter with you . 
why don't you eat some of it , Thomas ? 
why don't you eat some ? 
Mummy's on the telephone now so be quiet .

that was Daddy phoning up . 
and when Mummy rang him back Fiona answered . 
and Daddy said it didn't matter anymore . 
he didn't needta speak to us . 
so I don't know why Daddy wanted us <if he didn't want us> [>] .

just before we started lunch . 
oh it's the white truck „ isn't it ? 
that gentleman is going round collecting bags for Cancer_Research . 
that's right . 
I wonder if he (h)as seen our bag . 
yes . 
he has . 
<he's coming> [/] he's coming up the path to pick our bag up . 
we only had one thing to put in the bag this morning „ didn't we ? 
because we seem to have had so many bags recently . 
bags [//] white bags . 
it was the white bag with the blue pattern on it . 
white bag . 
and we seem to have had so many bags coming round here this past few weeks „ don't we ?

and he's collecting them now and he's going to take them somewhere . 
and they'll be sold in a Charity_Shop . 
he's getting +/. [+ IN] 
he's getting back in his van „ isn't he ? 
and shuting the door .

meow meow meow . 
oh Thomas , she (h)as got her paw stuck in the blind . 
oops . 
whoops_a_dear@f . 
she got her paw stuck in the blind „ didn't she ? 
no . 
she jumped into the window „ didn't she ? 
it's quite alright . 
I think she's having a look to see what she can see . 
yes . 
she probably saw the white truck . 
Mummy (h)as just been to the door because the man who came to collect the white bag put a blue and white card through the letter+box . 
look . 
it says <thank you> [//] <Imperial_Cancer_Research_Fund thank+you> [//] it says “thank you” , Thomas . 
and that's what you do when somebody gives you something you say thank you . 
Mummy gave the man a bag and he said thank you . 
and you're going to eat it now . 
no . 
now don't put it in your mouth . 
no [x 6] . 
no [x 5] . 
no . 
don't eat it . 
you just look at it and tell me that <it says thank you> [/] it says “thank you” . 
so when Mummy gave you a drink of juice <and some sausage roll> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
and some crisps you should have said thank you , Mummy . 
yes . 
oh are you still too busy telling Purdie off ? 
now look who (h)as come home .

no . 
it's not Nana . 
no [x 3] . 
it's Sue . 
no . 
it's not Nana . 
it's Sue . 
has Sue gone inside her house now and closed the door ? 
she must have come home from work . 
are you still reading that card that says “thank you” ? 
<thank you> [/] thank you . 
you're pulling a funny face , Thomas . 
wash and down . 
have you finished your lunch ? 
there is a bit of a mess „ isn't it ? 
because you've got cord trousers on . 
so in between all the little grooves all the crumbs for the crisps and the pastry on the sausage roll have collected . 
and the crumbs in <the creases> [//] the grooves . 
I think we'll hafta vacuum you with Noo_Noo . 
no . 
I don't think we'll vacuum Purdie with Noo_Noos . 
we brush Purdie „ don't we ? 
we have a special blue brush for brushing Purdie . 
have you dropped the juice ? 
Purdie has a brush and a comb everyday „ doesn't she ? 
nearly every morning and every night . 
and sometimes she has more than two brushes a day if she (h)as got her fur very matted . 
because Purdie +/. [+ IN] 
Purdie has very long hair „ doesn't she ? 
and she's quite old now . 
and she needs a little bit of help to keep her fur looking nice .

she forgot all about it . 
wash and down . 
oh she (h)as jumped down „ has she ? 
is she coming back to the door ?

mm . 
Mummy (h)as pinched one of your blue crisps . 
choc_choc@f .

that sounded like somebody's knocking on the window . 
is somebody knocking on the window , Thomas ? 
I think it was Uncle_Brian next door . 
he wasn't knocking on our window . 
he was doing something on his patio door . 
but it sounded like our window . 
it gave us quite a shock „ didn't it ? 
I beg your pardon . 
well you've dropped one „ haven't you ? 
I know you dropped one but I couldn't see where it went . 
oh Thomas , there's only two left . 
you might as well have the two that are in the box . 
but I don't know what Daddy's going to say because I think he put them in the fridge to hide them so we didn't find them . 
oh you can tell him when he comes home . 
no . 
you can't leave it to me . 
you can say Daddy I've eaten all your chocolate footballs out of the red box . 
oh chocolate footballs . 
oh . 
how many are in the box , Thomas ? 
how many ?
