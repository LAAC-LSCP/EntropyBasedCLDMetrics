right . 
come on , sweetheart . 
let's come <and have some breakfast> [>] . 
got some letters . 
got stamps . 
yes . 
they're empty books of stamps „ aren't they ? 
are you going to come and sit down and we'll have our breakfast . 
you don't want breakfast . 
how do you know you don't like it ? 
you've not had it yet ? 
have you ? 
well I think you might like it . 
oh I think you might . 
did you have a nice sleep ? 
oh be careful now . 
that's Daddy's printer . 
oh no . 
it's not . 
it's Daddy's scanner . 
no . 
we mustn't put anything on to that , Thomas . 
oh I don't think so , poppet . 
I don't think so . 
no . 
I don't think Daddy will be very pleased „ do you ? 
what would you like for breakfast , Thomas ? 
you're putting the stamps in the machine a little while . 
it's all mended „ is it ? 
you're fine . 
oh here's Postman_Pat's van . 
I'm just looking . 
it looks a little bit tatty@d at the edges that . 
I think the stickers are coming off „ aren't they ? 
no [/] no . 
you can't open it . 
the doors don't open on that , Thomas . 
painted red and yellow did you say ? 
or picking red and yellow . 
no . 
no picking red and yellow . 
it's a little red van „ isn't it ? 
it's a metal van and they've got stickers to represent Postman_Pat and [/] and Jess but the trouble is the stickers are getting a little bit loose . 
right . 
I'll just sort the curtains out and then I'll get something to drink . 
you'd like some beer . 
for breakfast . 
or tea . 
&=laughs . 
can you see a Christmas tree ? 
oh right . 
because you've just said not tea not coffee and then suddenly you went on to seeing a Christmas tree . 
oh right . 
oh you're giving Mummy a kiss . 
that's kind . 
going on your shoulder now . 
Postman_Pat's van is going on your shoulder now . 
is that the noise of the wheels as you're turning them round ? 
it is a funny noise „ isn't it ? 
why are you doing that silly laugh , Thomas ? 
thank you . 
what's Grandad ? 
oh I see . 
on the book of First_Class_Christmas stamps is a picture of a King . 
you think it looks like Grandad „ do you ? 
right . 
you're happier now . 
oh right . 
were you not happy before ? 
right . 
are you building a tunnel „ are you ? 
you're making a wall with the book of stamps for Postman_Pat . 
Postman_Pat's van . 
is that the little shed where the van sleeps ? 
one of these empty mini disc boxes would make a nice shed for Postman_Pat's van . 
look . 
it's about the right size . 
put it in that way . 
oh look at that . 
that's a garage „ isn't it ? 
so when Postman_Pat and Jess are having a sleep Postman_Pat's van could be having a sleep in the garage „ couldn't it ? 
resting ready for a busy day ahead . 
can you ? 
did you ? 
you heard a funny noise then . 
what do you think the noise was ? 
oh right . 
there we are . 
there's a drink of juice . 
well pretend it's beer then . 
have a glass of beer . 
&=laughs . 
pardon . 
oh right . 
can you see a man ? 
where can you see a man ? 
oh where can you see +... [+ IN] 
oh it isn't +... [+ IN] 
oh right . 
well it's not a bottle of beer , Thomas . 
it's a bottle of wine . 
and it's some Spanish wine . 
and it's a picture of a man on top of the bottle „ isn't it ? 
is that the man you said you could see ? 
hm: . 
do you wanna look at the man ? 
is like Sharon ? 
well Sharon +/. [+ IN] 
oh like David . 
I was just about say Sharon's a lady . 
it can't be like Sharon but you're meaning it's like Sharon's husband David . 
Uncle_David . 
so that bottle of wine has come from the place that we went to on our holiday . 
Spain . 
mind you don't drop it , Thomas . 
Mummy won that in a raffle on Saturday „ didn't she ? 
we bought some tickets and then a lady went to the front . 
and Sonia helped „ didn't she ? 
and she called out lots_of numbers . 
and we did very well because we got the second prize which was an electric toaster . 
and then we got a bottle of wine at the end . 
but actually , Thomas . 
I'll let you into a secret . 
we bought a book of stamps and we put Miss_P Lastname on . 
which is Purdie . 
and she won second prize and an electric toaster . 
so when Mummy went to collect it Mummy hadta pretend it was Daddy's sister Aunty_Patricia . 
because I couldn't really say a pussy cat (h)as juts won an electric toaster „ could I ? 
are you going to hold it like that ? 
and that's ever so funny because we've been complaining about our toaster for weeks now „ haven't we ? 
doesn't always pop up . 
and then Purdie <won one in a raffle> [>] . 
it looks like blackcurrant juice . 
yes . 
but it's not . 
it's wine . 
it's red wine . 
oh the bottle's going to lie down a little while „ is it ? 
it's very sleepy . 
it's rolling . 
well I think we better put it back there and the man can look at you „ don't you ? 
yes . 
let's put it back on the shelf . 
and then you can see the man looking at you . 
right . 
I'll pop it back . 
can you see him ? 
oh that's the little sticker on it . 
number forty . 
because it was the fortieth raffle prize . 
would you like some cornflakes ? 
bananas in pyjamas . 
do I take that that was a yes or a no ? 
yes . 
I think it was probably a little yes . 
Grandma and Grandad are coming to look after Thomas „ aren't they ? 
where 0has [*] Mummy gone ? 
where (h)as Mummy gone ? 
I haven't gone anywhere yet . 
but I'm going to work . 
shall you miss me ? 
you'd like to hold the box . 
oh_gosh yes . 
do you see that white van ? 
pardon . 
what's inside it ? 
I don't know because it looks like it's delivering something to one of the neighbors . 
delivering parcels . 
yes . 
it's not the post van „ is it ? 
it's the white van . 
it's the parcel firm van . 
one of the neighbors must have ordered a present for Christmas , Thomas . 
Thomas Lastname , is that your tummy ? 
it's your tummy . 
what do you say ? 
no . 
you don't , Thomas . 
that is not polite . 
you're a polite boy . 
you say +... [+ IN] 
go on you tell me what you say . 
excuse me . 
no [/] no . 
excuse me please . 
no . 
Father_Christmas won't come to little boys who don't say excuse me please . 
xxx . 
that reminds me , Thomas . 
you need a bib . 
&=laughs . 
I wouldn't have remembered . 
but you said +/. [+ IN] 
a bib . 
that (h)as just reminded me . 
no bib . 
Thomas would like a Mummy bib . 
do you mean you'd like to wear my apron ? 
I don't even know where the apron is , Thomas . 
we wore it the other day when we did that cake for Purdie but I haven't seen it since . 
or do you mean that you'd like Mummy to wear a bib ? 
you want Mummy to wear your bib . 
oh . 
you're going to sip your wine now . 
there we are . 
let's put the cornflakes back in the cupboard „ shall we ? 
ahhah . 
there we are . 
we slipped the bib on while you weren't looking . 
what do you think you'll be doing today with Nana and Grandad ? 
chasing Grandad . 
&=laughs . 
what do you mean chasing Grandad ? 
is it something you and Grandad play ? 
does Grandad know about it ? 
no . 
you're just going to chase him „ are you ? 
where are you going to chase him ? 
no . 
but where are you going to chase him ? 
chase him up in the air . 
you would bump your head . 
yes . 
you'd hit the ceiling „ wouldn't you ? 
but where are you going to chase him , Thomas ? 
you sound like you're saying ban [//] &-um climb a big mouse in the air bang but I don't understand . 
Mummy doesn't understand , Thomas . 
have you seen the pictures on these little stamps ? 
these are some stamps that Grandma gave you „ aren't they ? 
do you remember we put stamps like this on Grandma's birthday card envelope a few weeks ago ? 
these are some stamps that Grandma (h)as given you that you can lick and put on Christmas cards . 
they're not stamps (.) that let Postman_Pat deliver stamps to people . 
they're just pretty little stamps „ aren't they ? 
to make the envelopes look bright . 
who's that ? 
it's who ? 
xxx . 
Thomas ! 
oh you do come out with some silly words . 
what is the picture showing ? 
a pussy cat . 
what's on it ? 
look . 
it's a ginger and white +... [+ IN] 
well ginger striped pussy cat . 
and there's something on it's tail „ isn't there ? 
some green leaves and some white berries . 
and that's called mistletoe . 
no [/] no [/] no [/] no . 
you never eat anything with berries on . 
Mummy (h)as told you that „ hasn't she ? 
look . 
the picture underneath is berries as well . 
it's <a picture> [/] a picture of holly and ivy . 
and the holly (h)as got berries . 
at Christmas time you see holly , Thomas . 
with berries . 
and you see what the cat (h)as got on it's tail . 
and that's mistletoe . 
and do you know what you do with mistletoe ? 
you hold it up like this over somebody's head and you go 0 [=! makes a noise] . 
give them a kiss under the mistletoe . 
so will you be holding some over Isabel's head ? 
and then you can give her a kiss „ can't you ? 
were you kissing her on Sunday without mistletoe ? 
what were you doing ? 
mistletoe . 
you were kissing her without mistletoe „ weren't you ? 
and look this one just shows some +... [+ IN] 
those are called Christmas roses . 
you get lots_of flowers . 
well you don't get lots_of flowers at Christmas . 
not like in summer . 
but you get red plants . 
and you often see these white roses . 
kissing mistletoes [*] . [+ SR] 
well if we go to the shop or I'll ask Nana and Grandad if they go out shopping when we see any mistletoe in the greengrocer's or the supermarket I'll show you what it is , Thomas . 
we might try and find a little piece before Christmas . 
oh you missed your party . 
you should have had it with you on Wednesday at the party when all those pretty girls were there in their party dress . 
Aunty_Patty's in there . 
where about ? 
<somebody told> [/] somebody told Grandad . 
what did somebody tell Grandad about Aunty_Patty ? 
has Aunty_Patty been kissing people under the mistletoe ? 
oh [/] oh Thomas , do you think she has ? 
Aunty_Patty (h)as been kissing Grandad under the mistletoe . 
Sonia's toe . 
no , Thomas . 
mistletoe is the plant that you hold and you go 0 [=! kissing noise] . 
mistletoe . 
so that ginger pussy cat . 
look . 
has mistletoe on it's toe . 
I think it must be going round to see if he can find a pretty cat like Purdie to give a little kiss to . 
and look . 
what's on this stamp ? 
that's a Christmas pudding . 
&-um that's a chocolate log . 
chocolate log . 
and on top of the chocolate log what is there ? 
what is it ? 
what is it ? 
I think it's a candle like we had on Purdie's birthday cake last night . 
can you see the candle on top of the chocolate log ? 
and you know what those are . 
what are they ? 
pink roses . 
no . 
next to the Christmas pudding here . 
look . 
green grapes . 
you like grapes „ don't you ? 
there's brown grapes and green grapes . 
I was trying to stop your juice from making that squeaky noise . 
it's the air . 
now these are things that you've seen before but I don't know whether you remember from last year , Thomas . 
these are Christmas crackers . 
oh do you remember last week when we were in John_Lewis you saw some Christmas crackers . 
because I think they must have had tubes of Smarties inside because they were all decorated like Smarties . 
and you hold one end of the Christmas cracker and Mummy holds the other and we pull [/] pull [/] pull [/] pull [/] pull till it snaps and go ow . 
and you usually find a party hat inside . 
you know you wore a party hat on Tuesday . 
you've pull it . 
and there's a little joke inside and usually a little toy or something . 
post it . 
oh you've posted the stamp in your booster chair . 
and there's one more thing on that picture . 
paper chains . 
pull that . 
we're going to make some paper chains one day . 
oh you're busy [/] busy posting the stamps through the slot in your chair „ are you ? 
another slot . 
two slots . 
there's a slot in each side of the chair „ isn't there ? 
and look . 
there's another stamp there . 
now who's that on there ? 
Christmas +... [+ IN] 
Christmas^poops@c . 
Thomas , I think that's Angel_Gabriel . 
&=laughs . 
what's Christmas^poops@c ? 
you are silly . 
you come up with your own words . 
no [/] no . 
don't put your stamps in your Rice_Krispies . 
look . 
can you see the angel's blowing a trumpet ? 
he (h)as got wings and a halo . 
no . 
not hello . 
a halo . 
it's a hat . 
can you see he (h)as got wings ? 
the angel can fly with wings . 
look . 
like a bird . 
can you not see them ? 
Thomas . 
no . 
you're pretending to throw bread to the ducks but there aren't any ducks . 
and I've just seen a cornflake fly past my ear and land on the kitchen floor . 
that's not nice „ is it ? 
you . 
a nincompoop . 
yes . 
you are a nincompoop . 
Thomas is a nincompoop . 
now be careful . 
don't push your spoon too far in your mouth . 
you'll break your +... [+ IN] 
eat nicely please . 
do they taste good . 
what are you doing ? 
putting the spoon into Postman_Pat's garage . 
steady . 
you're going to knock your cornflakes over . 
no . 
come on . 
are you going to eat some more breakfast ? 
not need that . 
oh you're going to be hungry later , Thomas . 
what do you think you'll be having for lunch with Nana and Grandad ? 
a poo^poop@c . 
Thomas , that's xxx poo^poops@c . [+ PI] 
oh nincompoop . 
you can't eat nincompoops „ can you ? 
he's going into the garage backwards „ is he ? 
backways@c . 
is the garage at Postman_Pat's house or is it at the Post_Office ? 
Post_Office is closed . 
but is the garage next to the Post_Office or is it next to Postman_Pat's house ? 
right . 
that would make sense really „ wouldn't it ? 
because then when he arrives home after a busy day he can just put the van straight in the garage . 
you heard a farmer . 
what was the farmer doing ? 
pull the garage . 
can you see the van in the garage by pulling the door ? 
oh I see . 
yes . 
that's nice „ isn't it ? 
the [/] the little box we're playing with has a tiny slot in it so it looks like a window „ doesn't it ? 
you can actually peep through and see the van without opening the door . 
very clever . 
shall we have some toast now , Thomas ? 
no . 
well I'll make it and then if you fancy a piece you can have some „ can't you ? 
Thomas , what do you say ? 
yes please . 
you'd like a chocolate ball as well . 
green one . 
well I think you better eat some more breakfast first „ don't you ? 
and then it'll be time +... [+ IN] 
we can open the Advent_Calendar then „ can't we ? 
0 [=! coughs] . 
excuse me . 
Mummy's coughing . 
where (h)as it gone ? 
oh look . 
0 [=! coughs] . 
hold the bread . 
no . 
it's not very hot yet . 
it's just bread . 
I'll put it in the toaster and cook it and then it might be a bit hotter . 
would you like a piece of bread ? 
here you are . 
are you going to share that with Postman_Pat ? 
you're offering Jess a piece of sandwich „ are you ? 
did he think that was lovely ? 
just looking to see what the weather's doing today , Thomas . 
raining . 
I think it has been . 
it's not raining at the moment . 
it looks like it might have been raining in the night because things +/. [+ IN] 
no . 
I don't +... [+ IN] 
well I don't think it (h)as been snowing but it might have been . 
we were asleep „ weren't we ? 
shall we open the blind ? 
we pulled the curtains back earlier on but we didn't open the blind . 
ah the garden looks an awful mess , Thomas . 
I must try and find the time to tidy up these tubs . 
can you see this beautiful rose down here ? 
isn't that a gorgeous rose ? 
well <it's a> [/] <it's a pink> [/] it's a pink and cream rose . 
oh just seen Postman_Pat's van . 
he (h)as driven past . 
a big red Parcel_Force van . 
somebody gave Mummy that rose in February or March and it was cream and now it (h)as gone very pink and it (h)as had about the fourth flowers on it since then . 
Mummy's special rose . 
pardon [>] . 
well we can't hold the rose because we're inside and the rose is outside . 
but doesn't it look messy on the patio . 
xxx in the summer . [+ PI] 
a lot of +/. [+ IN] 
oh look who it is there ? 
it's the ginger pussy cat . 
do you think the ginger pussy cat might eat that Purdie hasn't eaten ? 
no . 
we'll try an open the door without frightening him . 
I don't think he's fed very well . 
0 [=! coughs] . 
let's [/] let's just open the door . 
yes . 
he's hiding under the table . 
he might run away but if we put some food out he might just come back . 
don't tell Daddy we've done this . 
he won't be happy „ will he ? 
oh I didn't see him go . 
I know he walked past (.) when Mummy put the plate down but I didn't see where he'd gone to . 
did he run very quickly ? 
we'll leave it there a few moments . 
it's some food we put down for Purdie last night and she (h)as not eaten it all . 
and she's very fussy Purdie . 
if it (h)as been left on the plate a while she won't eat it so when she comes down stairs this morning she's not going to want it . 
it was a shame to waste it and I thought ginger pussy cat might like it if he was hungry . 
I didn't see where he went to , Thomas . 
because he was sat under the table when I opened the door . 
just disappeared . 
are you going to call him ? 
food for you . 
here , Puss [/] Puss [/] Puss . 
here , Puss [/] Puss [/] Puss . 
is that what we say ? 
no . 
I don't know where he (h)as gone , Thomas . 
I'm sure he'll be back . 
he has gone somewhere . 
yes . 
well he's [/] he's &-um a bit of bully where other cats are concerned but I think with humans he's a little bit frightened . 
with [/] with men and ladys and children . 
boys and girls . 
boys and girls . 
so I think perhaps when he saw me walking towards the door he must have run away because he didn't wanna talk to us . 
ginger [<] cat , come out here . 
yes . 
no . 
he (h)as not seen the food „ has he ? 
I think if he had he might have come back to eat it . 
perhaps he (h)as already had his breakfast and he (h)as got a full tummy already . 
he's quite a big pussy cat „ isn't he ? 
no . 
he's not eating it . 
I think what he needs , Thomas . 
is somebody to be nice and gentle with him . 
and give him a stroke and be loving to him like we are to Purdie . 
because you've got to treat animals nicely „ haven't you ? 
are you gentle with Purdie ? 
no . 
pardon . 
you frighten her . 
you pat her . 
oh you shouldn't pat her . 
you can stroke her gently . 
and you do pat her occasionally like you pat a dog but I don't think you do it too hard . 
it was her birthday yesterday „ wasn't it ? 
no . 
you didn't pat her on her birthday . 
it's an aeroplane . 
is it Harold_the_helicopter ? 
you've eaten a whole piece of dry bread . 
was it nice ? 
no . 
big bears eat it . 
big bears eat trees . 
do they ? 
when we go to the park you always say that there are big bears living in the trees „ don't you ? 
and do they come out at night when it gets dark ? 
if the big bears are like teddy bears they're nice „ aren't they ? 
Mummy's old teddy bear's very gentle „ isn't he ? 
he wouldn't harm anybody . 
and you've got some nice teddy bears „ haven't you ? 
but your teddy bears don't live behind trees . 
they live at the bottom of the bed „ don't they ? 
a chocolate ball please . 
come and have a bit of toast first . 
and then we'll see about opening the Advent_Calendar „ shall we ? 
because we've got little chocolate balls inside the Advent_Village houses and shops . 
and we've got chocolates behind your Thomas_The_Tank_Engine Advent_Calendar „ haven't we ? 
and I think we'll let Grandma and Grandad do the Advent_Christmas tree with you this morning . 
you choose a little character from the pocket . 
it'll be number eight today „ won't it ? 
and then you choose a place to put it on the tree . 
and then I think Dimitra might be coming tomorrow morning . 
I'm not sure . 
we must remember to ring her before Mummy goes to work . 
if she comes tomorrow you and Dimitra can +... [+ IN] 
0 [=! coughs] . 
excuse me . 
+, open number nine together „ can't you ? [+ IN] 
did you do that last week with Dimitra ? 
no . 
well I think you did . 
no [/] no . 
where (h)as Postman_Pat's van gone ? 
I think it might have gone (.) into the garage , Thomas . 
oh you're asking Postman_Pat if he'd like a chocolate ball and then you're telling Postman_Pat would like a chocolate ball too . 
and Jess would like one . 
Thomas , that means you're going to get three chocolate balls . 
oh yes . 
well let's open the Advent_Calendar . 
where's number eight ? 
number eight . 
number eight . 
number eight . 
can you see number eight ? 
oh number eight's there .

is your mouth sore ? 
you're holding your mouth again . 
oops a daisy . 
we had dropped the whole thing „ hadn't we ? 
here we are . 
now if Mummy just opens the tiny bit in the corner are you going to pull the flap back ? 
no . 
pull it back , darling . 
that's [/] that's it . 
gently . 
oh look . 
what is it ? 
a man . 
no . 
it's <a chocolate &-um> [//] a Christmas pudding . 
look what (h)as it got on top . 
got grapes . 
it's holly . 
<do you> [<] remember we were talking about holly before ? 
very prickly green leaves but very pretty red berries . 
the birds like to eat holly . 
I think you'll find that Aunty_Linda has a [/] a holly bush at the back of her house . 
and you see lots_of birds (.) pecking on the berries . 
it's a little piece of cellotape . 
I was just going to stick the flap back on the Advent_Calendar . 
we needta keep all the little doors in place so that we can see the picture . 
you wanna hold the fat controller a little while . 
right . 
I shall just level this piece of cellotape on there . 
how's that ? 
I think we'll be getting our Christmas tree today „ don't you ? 
oh . 
Postman_Pat's going in the bushes or Postman_Pat's van ? 
do you mean he's driving behind some bushes ? 
right . 
is it very dark ? 
it is dark „ is it ? 
very [/] very sunshining@c . 
it's not too bad this morning I suppose „ is it ? 
well is it in the bushes or has it gone back in the garage . 
it (h)as gone back in the bushes „ has it ? 
I can't find the little thing on the cellotape telling us where the roll starts . 
oh here it is . 
hiding in the bushes „ is he ? 
Thomas , would you like an apple or a little orange now ? 
you'd like a little orange . 
right . 
Postman_Pat and Jess would like some „ would they ? 
going to share it with them . 
that's a good boy . 
oh dear . 
you've dropped the garage now . 
you've dropped the plant . 
oh is the box a plant now ? 
no [/] no [/] no [/] no . 
no . 
you don't bang . 
it isn't a hammer , Thomas . 
it's a spoon that you've been eating your cornflakes with [>] . 
no . 
it isn't a hammer . 
but listen . 
if you bang that little van do you know what's going to happen ? 
the paint's going to chip off it . 
and instead of having a nice shiny red van it's going to look a mess . 
what are you doing ? 
pushing your spoon into the slot in your chair . 
and reaching the stamps out that you posted earlier . 
right . 
have you finished with the cornflakes ? 
would you like some more ? 
well in that case then let's clear the cornflakes away and the spoon . 
no . 
because you're not . 
you're banging things with it , Thomas . 
no [/] no [/] no . 
no , sweetheart . 
because you +/. [+ IN]

let's have a little apple . 
do you not wanna finish your toast ? 
well you're probably full after that piece of bread „ aren't you ?

well don't pick your nose please . 
it's not nice . 
is that a scratch ? 
no . 
just a little piece of toast crumb on your nose . 
it looked like a scratch . 
<like a scratch like a tummy> [>] . 
we'll hafta buy some more oranges at the shop „ won't we ? 
because we've [/] we've only got one more left when you've eaten this . 
do you think you'll be going to the supermarket with Nana and Grandad ? 
for some more oranges . 
we need some milk „ don't we ? 
I'll hafta ask Grandma if she wouldn't mind buying some milk when you go shopping .
