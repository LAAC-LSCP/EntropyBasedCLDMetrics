okay . 
we're using a till for the suitcase „ aren't we ?

we watch magpies chomping away on the bin bags . 
at the back of the house . 
you know [*] Battersby's live ?

do you think a fox was looking .

we actually saw one of those , Thomas . 
we saw that lady with all her suitcases .

I bet she was embarrassed actually . 
because she looked quite funny „ didn't it ? 
oh [>] no . 
the guard wasn't pulling it . 
no . 
it was &-um [//] it was a little truck . 
but the lady the passenger . 
was sitting with the guard in the front . 
and she had all her suitcases in the back . 
and (.) it was trundling along . 
and normally you just see a driver . 
pulling a cart load of &-um suitcases . 
but only this time he had a passenger as well . 
so I imagine the lady was very grateful . 
because +... [+ IN] 
+, she didn't look as if she'd be able to walk very far . 
and &-um (.) you know poor guard on his own . 
he couldn't of carried all her suitcases . 
and she certainly couldn't carry them . 
so it was a very useful little thing „ wasn't it ? 
I'm on .

I thought I'd arrived in London ? 
well you see if I hailed a taxi . 
<if I> [/] if I put my hand up and get a taxi . 
then I'm sure all my luggage would go in the taxi . 
and the taxi driver would take me to the hotel . 
and then when I got there . 
either the taxi driver would help me . 
or the porter at the hotel would help . 
but I thought I was going to London on holiday . 
a flat ? 
my hotel ? 
oh right . 
well you've been a very [/] very kind train driver . 
I've never come across such a helpful train man before . 
&-um no doubt you want a very big tip „ do you ? 
tipping it into the house ? 
oh [?] .

when you give somebody a tip .

it's when you think a waiter [//] when you think . 
they've done a really good job . 
when you think they've served you well .

you pay the bill . 
you pay them whatever you owe them for the bill . 
and then you say “you've done a jolly good job well done” . 
and give them a little bit extra . 
and that's called giving a tip . 
so I'm going to give you a tip . 
because I have never come across a worker . 
who's worked so hard with my luggage before . 
let me open my purse . 
well here we are . 
there's some money here .

there you are . 
there's a five pound note .
