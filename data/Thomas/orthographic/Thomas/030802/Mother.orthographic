Ginger . 
so so far we've got Purdie (.) Felix (.) Ginger . 
and there's a grey cat and a white cat . 
we don't know those „ do we ? 
might be Molly ? 
well shall we pretend that one's Molly ? 
and what about that one ? 
Tiddles . 
it could be Tiddles „ couldn't it ? 
right . 
the bee replied my home's a hive . [+ R] 
that's where I'm going to fly . [+ R] 
so Tabby kitten +//. [+ IN] [+ R]

and off he ran just as a squirrel came hoping through the glade . [+ R] 
look (.) the tabby pussy cat (h)as gone . 
the grey pussy cat (h)as gone . 
what's left ?
