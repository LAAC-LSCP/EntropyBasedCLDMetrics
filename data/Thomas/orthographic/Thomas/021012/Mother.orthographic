why don't you drive to Missus_Pottage's house because you're bound to have a letter for her .

that doesn't mind coming put every five minutes when my chip pan's on fire .

I had a terrible accident . 
the chip pan's on fire .

a big cloth . 
that's right .

you saw the fireman . 
he rushed in and he grabbed the big cloth . 
I would imagine it's a fire blanket . 
but if you haven't got a fire blanket you can use something like an ordinary towel or a tea towel . 
and he threw it on top of the [/] the fire &-uh the flames „ didn't he ? 
on the pan . 
you never pour water onto the chip pan because when the water hits the fat it would go whoosh and splash everyone . 
and really badly burn them . 
you either put a fire blanket on like the firemen do or you know Mummy's baking trays ? 
like the big trays she bakes the biscuits on . 
something like that to put on top . 
or else you get something like a towel or a tea towel . 
and ring it out . 
you can put water on the tea towel . 
ring it out . 
and put it on to smother the flames .

that the fireman said no water . 
my bag's on fire .

when we're walking to the Spar shop we've seen this for quite a long time .

it must have been blowing along the streets and then a big gust of wind has taken it whoosh up in the air . 
and it (h)as got stuck right on top of the tree . 
well just has , darling . 
that's what happens when [/] when things blow up . 
if it hadn't met the tree it might have just floated up and up and up into the sky . 
but because there's a big tree in the way one of the branches caught the bag . 
and the bag's +... [+ IN] 
it's a white plastic bag „ isn't it ?

the chips . 
I don't think we'll ever have a chip pan fire at home , Thomas . 
because we don't have chips , do we ? 
if we have chips we have oven chips .

or we go round to the chip shop .

the Fireman_Sam bumped your head „ didn't it ?

it was just a xxx on the fire engine . [+ PI] 
no . 
there isn't . 
I don't think he did , Thomas . 
the fireman's up in the sky „ is he ? 
has he climbed to the top of the ladder ? 
look . 
this fireman +... [+ IN] 
have you seen him cling onto the ladders ? 
shall we put up the ladders . 
ah have you fallen out with the fireman ? 
oh he's a lovely little fireman . 
he's not a dirty fireman . 
if he (h)as got a dirty face it's probably because he (h)as been fighting fires . 
and it's covered in smoke . 
and when you get covered in smoke then your face goes black . 
all grey and sooty . 
that's his oxygen mask . 
oxygen in there . 
xxx &-uh xxx . [+ PI] 
yes . 
it's breathing apparatus . 
when firemen go into very hot smoky places they need some help breathing and they have masks on . 
and they carry big tanks with oxygen on their backs . 
which is what that is . 
but look <there's a space> [/] there's a space there at the back of the fire engine for the oxygen cannister to stand so it doesn't get lost . 
that's not very kind „ is it ? 
I saw that . 
did you say disappear and you threw the fireman into the air ? 
you definitely said +... [+ IN] 
ooh ! 
you definitely said disappear „ didn't you ? 
you definitely said disappear . 
and if I was a fireman I wouldn't help you out in a fire if that's your attitude . 
tossing him up and throwing him in the air . 
poor fireman . 
xxx . 
what are you singing ? 
lots_of party . 
lots_of partys and crumbs on a plate . 
there aren't any crumbs . 
there are some crumbs on the floor because I haven't vacuumed yet . 
take your shoes and socks off . 
or your slippers . 
you're wearing slippers xxx . [+ PI] 
look . 
we'll take the slippers and socks off . 
and your trousers . 
we'll [<] get you changed . 
and then Mummy'll dress you and put your shoes on because we can go for a walk then „ can't we ? 
well you're doing something now . 
xxx . 
I can see it but I don't needta feel it . 
I can see it's bulging . 
and I can see xxx . [+ PI] 
no . 
you mustn't touch your nappie . 
xxx . 
oh dear dear . 
you did all that behind the chair „ did you ? 
not pleasant „ is it ? 
open wide . 
let's put it in the dustbin wagon . 
it (h)as got to go somewhere . 
very smelly . 
Tom , just don't mess with your legs when I'm trying to do this . 
otherwise we'll get it everywhere „ won't we ? 
what will make you sore ? 
&=laughs . 
well you might get very sore but it wouldn't come to that because I wouldn't let you walk round in it . 
if you're accidentally get sore you hafta go in the bath „ don't you ? 
it doesn't really happen now but when you were a baby sometimes you'd been rolling all over the place . 
it was most unpleasant . 
but I think we've got past that really „ haven't we ? 
now . 
you should be using the <potty now> [>] . 
pardon . 
no settee . 
what do you mean no settee ? 
right . 
just put your legs down now properly , Thomas . 
that's it . 
legs down . 
there we are . 
put it in that plastic bag . 
a special nappie bag . 
ready for the dustbin man . 
that's right . 
get some cotton wool and put some lotion on . 
yes . 
Mummy'll wrap up the +... [+ IN] 
no . 
put your legs down , Thomas . 
please . 
no . 
I know you xxx but it's not easy for me trying to clean you up . 
xxx when you've got your nappie on you can do whatever you like with your xxx . [+ PI] 
but while you're having your nappie done Mummy is in control you cheeky thing . 
you've got such a cheeky face , Thomas Lastname . 
you've got a what face ? 
a dirty face . 
you haven't because I gave you a lovely wash after lunch . 
you just seem to be extremely tired . 
I don't know what the matter is . 
you've been very quiet for a few days now . 
it isn't like you . 
mind you xxx . [+ PI] 
I worry when you're quiet . 
I wonder what's the matter with my little boy . 
what did you say about washing up ? 
leave me alone . 
oh is that what Mummy did ? 
leave me alone . 
I'm washing up . 
is that what Mummy says ? 
ah . 
no . 
I think the thing is sometimes , Thomas . 
are we going to have a little talk now ? 
Mummy and Daddy love to hear what you hafta say . 
we're always very interested . 
but there are times especially when Daddy comes home from work when you just need a few minutes together just so Daddy can tell Mummy what sort of day he (h)as had . 
and so that we can tell Daddy if anybody (h)as been on the telephone and things like that . 
and so sometimes when we say shh . 
Thomas , be quiet . 
that's why . 
well because Mummy and Daddy hafta sometimes have a conversation . 
and if Daddy or Mummy says Thomas please be quiet it's usually something quite serious that we're talking about . 
and we don't wanna be interrupted . 
and there are times when you hafta be quiet . 
it's like music class . 
when you're in the music class with Julian when Julian's talking everybody hasta be quiet „ don't they ? 
when Julian says shh everybody shhes@n . 
and it's the same at home . 
if Daddy says shh he's usually saying it for a reason . 
yes . 
somebody might be coming . 
yes . 
that's especially true when we've got visitors in the house . 
well visitors like to see you as well but sometimes it's a little bit rude if you go straight up and barge in when Daddy's having a conversation „ isn't it ? 
sometimes you just hafta wait a few minutes . 
does that sound reasonable ? 
and sometimes on the telephone it can be very difficult if [/] if they've [/] they've got a bad line . 
if we've got a bad line we can't hear what's being said . 
and if you're going 0 [=! makes a noise] in the background (..) it's very difficult to hear . 
&-um . 
but you're being quiet today xxx . [+ PI] 
you've been quiet for a few days now . 
are you not feeling very well ? 
you're just tired . 
what are you doing ? 
the mixer . 
the mixer's in the bathroom . 
you've been playing with your toy mixer in the bathroom for the past few weeks . 
you've still got your dumper truck and the crane and (.) all those sorts of things down here . 
no . 
well you've +... [+ IN] 
true . 
you haven't got a crane but you've got toys that you pretend are cranes . 
that's something that we could put on your birthday list „ isn't it ? 
we keep wanting ideas for birthdays . 
you need another toy box . 
you cheeky monkey . 
you probably will after your birthday . 
expecting a lot of presents „ are you ? 
&=laughs . 
who said you might need another toy box after your birthday ? 
Daddy . 
oh Daddy did . 
oh well as long as Daddy's going to buy it that's alright . 
did Daddy really say we'll need another toy box after your birthday ? 
did he ? 
when did he say that ? 
he said what ? 
in your tooth . 
I'm going to have words with that Daddy when he comes home tonight .
