there you are . 
look at that . 
abra_cadabra . 
shh . 
Tom , look if you're going to shout I'm going to get very cross . 
I don't want shouting . 
listen . 
you've got to learn to be quiet , Thomas . 
not everybody likes a lot of noise you know . 
on the Tweenies +/. [+ IN] 
Miles [//] not Miles (.) Milo is often noisy „ isn't he ? 
and the others get fed up with him . 
they don't find it funny . 
they get cross „ don't they ? 
they get sick of it . 
hey ? 
you heard of people being sick of something ? 
right . 
well are you going to help me make a jelly now ? 
right . 
we've just got to boil the kettle for a second . 
I shall move this microphone over here (.) because it will make a din when the kettle's on . 
oh that was clever . 
right . 
now we've got to use boiling water so we've got to be really careful . 
<see what we've done with> [<] the jelly . 
<right (.) here we are> [>] . 
now I haven't made jelly from a packet before . 
I've always made it from cubes . 
this is (.) powder „ isn't it ? 
let's have a look . 
oh right . 
so I've got to get the jug ready first . 
oh two seventy five milliliters . 
that's a bit of a nuisance (.) because +... [+ IN]

let me see what this one is . 
we've got three measuring jugs . 
litres +... [+ IN] 
let's just try the other one (.) and see what that says . 
here we are . 
we could do with abra_cadabra for this „ can't we ? 
right , Tom . 
<shh shh> [/] shh . 
just calm down now please .

<right I'm going to> [<] +... [+ IN] 
you think it's twenty minutes „ do you ?

now I pour it in . 
it's strawberry . 
you smell that . 
look at the color . 
isn't that pretty ? 
they're jelly crystals . 
so sprinkle them (.) there . 
now would you like to get your little stool ? 
please . 
I think there's some dirty washing on top of it . 
you'll hafta (.) pop that on the floor for me . 
now <ever so steady> [/] ever so careful because (.) this is boiling water „ isn't it ?

now there's our spoon look . 
<stir stir> [/] stir .

look at that . 
all those jelly crystals have gone into the liquid „ haven't they ? 
apart from those few on the side . 
I'll just <try and rescue those> [>] . 
yeah . 
you can look at the packet if you like . 
now are you going <to help> [/] to help stir this ? 
right [/] right just let's dissolve those . 
ever so carefully because you mustn't get your fingers near it or mustn't stir it quick . 
because if it splashes the water will jump up and bite „ won't it ? 
it'll be so hot . 
there we are . 
stir it . 
do we know any songs about stirring or mixing ? 
I don't think I do .

how's that ? 
mixy@wp mixy@wp . 
do you know what we should have done before we started ? 
we should have washed our hands but we have just wiped them because you had an apple „ didn't you ? 
and after you (h)ad finished your apple I washed them . 
so (.) it was only a minute ago . 
and the shoes we've put in a box were clean „ weren't they ? 
there (.) now do you know what we've got to do ? 
we'll just leave it there . 
we'll pop it right at the back of the cooker . 
we've got to choose something to put it into . 
<we've got all sorts> [<] +... [+ IN]

what we'll do another day as well , Thomas +... [+ IN] 
+, <we'll make> [<] some jelly cubes . 
we'll make some jelly cubes and strawberries and we'll thread them on a skewer . 
that would be nice „ wouldn't it ? 
well no we can't do it now because I haven't got any fruit . 
I haven't got any strawberries or anything like that . 
right these are jelly moulds . 
right . 
right . 
now (.) there's that shape . 
that's a traditional jelly mould . 
or (.) there's that . 
what's that ? 
a pink [/] pink cat . 
a pussy cat jelly mould „ <isn't it> [>] ? 
another cat jelly mould . 
do you know why we've got so many pussy cat jelly moulds ? 
no don't touch that because if you knock the jelly over you'll get burnt . 
this is another +//. [+ IN] 
look at this . 
this is a huge jelly mould . 
that's a big one „ isn't it ? 
and somewhere +... [+ IN]

do you want the brown bear or the +... [+ IN] 
you want a pussy cat ? 
well we'll do a pussy cat and then (.) with any spare jelly we'll put them into one of the teddys „ shall we ? 
that's right . 
you don't need your wand now because you're busy making jelly „ aren't you ? 
right let's pop all these +... [+ IN] 
well stuff is a jolly good word . 
yeah . 
I was going to say put all these containers back . 
I thought that sounded better . 
no . 
I'm fine thank you , Thomas . 
if the jelly doesn't set (.) then I'll borrow your wand and we'll [/] we'll magic it „ shall we ? 
we've got to put everything back „ haven't we ? 
now the other thing I needta do is make sure we've got space in the fridge . 
oh sorry . 
in this one ? 
right . 
now this is a brass mould . 
no . 
not glass (.) brass . 
brass [>] .

<I could> [<] really hang that in the kitchen . 
that's where it's sposta be hung . 
yeah . 
Mummy uses the sheep one when I'm doing some mousses . 
salmon mousses and pates and things like that . 
you can stack them . 
although we're going to use one now for the jelly „ aren't we ? 
well (.) we'll give it a quick rinse under the cold tap . 
it's a long time since I've used this . 
now (.) this is the bit where we've got to be really careful „ haven't we ? 
we've got to give this jelly another mix up . 
oh look . 
a [/] a red jelly going into a red pussy cat mould . 
do you wanna give it one more stir for luck ? 
there you are . 
that's lovely . 
I tell you what . 
it dissolves a lot quicker than the cubes I'm useta using . 
mm . 
you have a smell . 
strawberries . 
if we had any strawberries in the house we could have sliced some strawberries into this „ couldn't we ? 
there we are . 
do you know if Purdie comes in now and sees this +... [+ IN] 
she's going to think +//. [+ IN] 
oh heck ! 
Mummy went over the edge .

right which +//. [+ IN] 
don't ! 
be careful . 
which (.) teddy bear ? 
the brown one or the white one ? 
the white one . 
alright . 
I'll give the white one a quick rinse as well . 
they should be clean because they've been in a storage container . 
but because they've been <in the drawer a long time> [>] +... [+ IN] 
right . 
and then let's wipe that little bit of jelly up there . 
there we are . 
we'll pour this (.) in [//] into the teddy bear mould . 
Mummy's not very good at this „ is she ? 
no . 
I've made a mess . 
well I think +//. [+ IN] 
yes . 
I was going to say (.) I mean I'm not particularly good at it but I think out of the two of us (.) I perhaps (.) hit the bowl better than you . 
but (.) maybe not very well . 
right . 
let's get a flat plate . 
oh no . 
we won't drop it . 
there we are . 
and I'll stand it very gently on there . 
pussy cat one . 
and the teddy bear one (.) very carefully there . 
and then I'll pop it right at the back (.) there . 
and we must leave it to set now . 
you mustn't touch those . 
and then when they're very cool (.) you can move them from <the top> [//] the work surface into the fridge . 
right . 
how's that ? 
well I haven't got anymore , Thomas . 
I'm sorry . 
<that's it> [<] . 
no . 
we've only got the three .

that didn't take many minutes . 
<there we> [>] +... [+ IN] 
and we'll be even more lazy , Thomas , and see if we've got a few things in the dishwasher . 
yeah . 
we'll use the dishwasher . 
it's “stupid , dear” „ is it ? 
oh well . 
it might be stupid but seeing as we've got a few things to wash already it's stupid not to use it . 
oops . 
have you fallen off your stool ? 
you're alright ? 
now we've got another job to do now . 
well you know when Nina came round ? 
she bought Mummy some flowers „ didn't she ? 
so we needta get the flowers in the vase now . 
Tom , please ! 
do not do that . 
oh no . 
it won't be set for a long [/] long time . 
I'll [<] hafta leave it there until it's really cold and then I'll pop it in the fridge and then we can probably eat it +... [+ IN] 
well I don't even think tea time . 
I think it will probably be lunchtime tomorrow . 
how's that ? 
pardon ? 
that is the jelly , darling . 
it doesn't look much like jelly now (.) it just looks like a [/] a sloshy drink „ doesn't it ? 
it looks like a strawberry drink .

mhm . 
it's very handy this little stool „ isn't it ? 
we can see what's happening . 
but listen (.) I don't mind you climbing up but you never ever touch anything up here (.) because that cooker might be hot . 
and on here there might be sharp knives or hot plates or something that will burn you . 
or liquid that would spill . 
so I don't mind you climbing up but never [/] never put your finger in anything you see up here „ will you ? 
Thomas , you listening ? 
no you're not ? 
well if you don't listen and you do that then the stool will go away .

number two . 
and then he comes at teatime .
