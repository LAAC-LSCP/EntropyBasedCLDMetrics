I didn't realize you had lots_of things like that .

is that a nice one ? 
there's another car transporter there [>] . 
I've mended lots_of things .

can't I ? 
but I've mended lots_of things . 
I think I've done really well .

this belongs to Buzz_Lightyear „ does it ?

does this have something to do with it , Thomas ?

did you know what the problem was ? 
with the (.) TNT lorry ? 
did Daddy have a look at all these things ?

and could Daddy not work out what had happened ? 
there's obviously a little screw missing somewhere , isn't there ? 
think it's that screw we found this morning ? 
really [<] ? 
oh [>] , Thomas . 
for goodness sake you're just crashing around . 
and then treading and breaking more things . 
no . 
it's too big for that . 
too big I'm afraid . 
it's not that one . 
have I not mended enough things ? 
I think I've done quite well . 
I've got some tickets here . 
I'm not sure what they're for .

there we are . 
we just need a screw for that . 
don't we ?

don't you ? 
thank you . 
for doing well yesterday ? 
that's right . 
you've got a TNT man . 
and I have as well . 
this one needs a screw . 
just there . 
or perhaps I could just do it with blue tack . 
the cab didn't useta tip „ did it ? 
that's not why it's broken . 
guess what ? 
I've lost the back of it now . 
oh this is the back of it . 
is that right ?

what's that ? 
mustn't break my Purdie up . 
xxx awful . [+ PI] 
yes but I know where the back is . 
it's round the back of you . 
isn't it ? 
what have you done with it ?

I'm going to try a little bit of blue tack . 
and see if that will do the trick . 
yes . 
0 [=! gasps] [>] . 
you've pinched all my blue tack ? 
I'm not cross . 
oh it takes more than <xxx was> [>] . [+ PI] 
well that's gone quickly . 
I thought that forty minutes has gone quickly . 
if that was four minutes . 
<there's my> [<] ticket . 
have I won a prize ? 
can I ? 
so what does the Buzz_Lightyear thing do then , Thomas ? 
so the whole thing could go in the bath „ <couldn't he> [>] really ? 
okay [<] . 
let's have a look at him then . 
you know the toys that we can't mend , Thomas .

that doesn't clip on there . 
it's nothing to do with this „ is it ?

which wheel [?] ? 
Thomas [<] . 
no . 
no . 
<I'm not doing this any more> [>] . 
no . 
because you just don't appreciate what goes into it . 
that's not nice „ is it ? 
no . 
I'll tell you why those don't turn round . 
because you've bent +... [+ IN] 
you've bashed it down on the ground . 
and I think you've bent those back things „ haven't you ? 
is it ? 
well you haven't deserved tea . 
because you've just broken what I've mended . 
have you ? 
well I think (.) if we really can't mend some of these things . 
<they just needta> [>] be slung out . 
don't you ? 
you won't be sad ? 
when they are thrown away ? 
are you ? 
well I'm not spending more time on it . 
here you are . 
now what I'll do . 
I'll just get a [>] +/. [+ IN] 
<a knife> [>] . 
<or something xxx > [<] . [+ PI] 
right . 
how many minutes ? 
have I ? 
I think I'll finish it before nine minutes . 
is time going up ? 
instead of down ? 
you like that clip holder „ don't you ? 
because you look like a supervisor . 
I said you like that clip board . 
I think this has been dropped on the ground . 
don't you ? 
hm: . 
&-um well you gave them all to me a while ago . 
and now +... [+ IN] 
look at this .

what do you say to Mummy ? 
you're [<] welcome . 
thank you very much . 
and did I manage to do it in the time ? 
good . 
I'm more pleased about that car transporter . 
because both Daddy and I tried to mend that . 
and we couldn't . 
now I'm just going to get the motorbike one sorted out . 
are you ? 
well I think you've only ever had one tanker . 
and it was a very inexpensive one . 
and it hasn't lasted long . 
so <I think> [>] . 
you could have another [>] tanker „ couldn't you ? 
sometime . 
well I don't know . 
you might hafta do more than just xxx . [+ PI] 
perhaps if you get some money for your birthday . 
that's perhaps what we needta do . 
or [<] you could ask for a tanker for your birthday „ couldn't you ? 
mhm . 
right . 
I see , Thomas . 
look . 
that's to keep them up when they're on the road . 
and when you finish . 
that's to unload them . 
right . 
would you like this ? 
on your bedroom window sill ? 
a display ? 
because the other plane belongs to the &-um space shuttle set . 
but this one just comes with a little stand on its own . 
doesn't it ? 
oh and I've still got to sort out Mr_Lightyear over here . 
are you ? 
you know what seventy minutes is , Thomas [>] ? 
just over an hour . 
sixty minutes in an hour . 
what ? 
oh lunch time . 
yes you can do . 
because I used it to bend the &-um wheels . 
whereabouts ? 
let's have a look . 
oh [>] it is sticky . 
what's that ? 
jam ? 
does it ? 
well that's alright then . 
but I can't think what that is from . 
lost property . 
<there's a> [<] little a little &-um frisbee there . 
look . 
no . 
no . 
she's +//. [+ IN] 
<don't you dare> [?] . 
she's not there anyway . 
she's outside . 
no . 
put the spoon back in the kitchen now . 
so is it just the water squirter we need ? 
is that all there is upstairs in the bathroom [>] ? 
and has that got anything to do with this , Thomas ? 
no ? 
really [<] not ? 
right . 
okay . 
but what's this from ? 
I [<] think it's something to do with the motorcyclist „ isn't it ? 
but what's +/? [+ IN] 
<horrible [?] squeak> [<] . 
this must belong to something , Thomas . 
and it's exactly the same screws . 
it's got to have something to do with this . 
what could it be ? 
because it's [//] you [/] you agree with me „ don't you ? 
xxx [>] . 
ah . 
how about +... [+ IN] 
+, that [<] . 
right [<] . 
oh [<] . 
yes that's what it is . 
<yes but then when> [<] +//. [+ IN] 
<ah look> [<] . 
<I can see xxx > [<] there . [+ PI] 
that's it . 
isn't it ? 
now what do you think that could be ? 
that's what it is . 
yes . 
we've finally done it . 
right . 
and I'll come down with <Buzz_Lightyear's squirter> [>] . 
right . 
xxx . 
right . 
come on . 
right . 
let's put this back on Buzz_Lightyear .
