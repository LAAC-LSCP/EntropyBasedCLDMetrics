somebody chucked their red slipper off .

oh that's the shoe cleaning foam , pots . 
because I'm going to clean your shoes in a minute . 
oh that's the shoe polish . 
don't take the top off that please . 
because you've been running around a lot outside „ haven't you ?

you can watch me if you like . 
we're just sorting <these other things out first> [>] .

it's a safety strap . 
it keeps you in when you're cycling . 
it hasn't fallen off the bike though . 
it's just hanging down „ isn't it ?

when he shuts the door there is a big bang „ isn't there ?

it isn't on a table though . 
it's on a writing bureau „ isn't it ? 
but at night .

see a bit more ? 
oh right . 
are you splashing onto your beanbag ?

no . 
you get +/. [+ IN] 
you get mixed up between me saying bin bags and beanbags . 
yes . 
when you say bin bag lorry you're thinking of Mondays . 
when the bin men come . 
and they throw the bin bags into the bin . 
but beanbags are what you sit on , Thomas . 
and you shouldn't throw them around like that . 
no . 
especially not in church . 
because you were in trouble on Sunday „ weren't you ? 
because you and Isabelle . 
and John . 
and Georgia . 
were all throwing beanbags „ weren't you ? 
and you were saying “bin bag lorry” . 
we missed the bin bag men yesterday , didn't we ? 
because we were out with Daddy . 
and the men came a little bit earlier than the normally do . 
with big steps on it . 
yes . 
oh look . 
who's at the front now ? 
who's cutting the tree at the front ? 
it's Brian . 
what's he doing ? 
he (h)as got a big black dustbin actually „ hasn't he ? 
talking of bin bags . 
I don't think he can hear you , sweetheart . 
because we've got the window closed . 
no . 
we can't open the door to say hello . 
he might turn round and see you . 
and I'm sure if he does he'll wave . 
he (h)as got a big black dustbin near the tree at the bottom of the drive „ hasn't he ? 
and he's using some special scissors , Thomas . 
called secateurs@s:fra . 
they're a bit stronger than ordinary scissors .

you taking it all in „ are you ? 
you saw a bee ? 
oh did it bang into the window ? 
smashed into the window „ did it ? 
no . 
there's no orange digger , Thomas . 
you keep telling me that you've seen an orange digger at the front . 
but I haven't seen it . 
<dig dig> [/] dig . 
so Brian's cutting the leaves off the trees and putting them into the black dustbin „ isn't he ? 
and there's a lady walking past now . 
that's the lady that has a little dog . 
Candy . 
but she hasn't got Candy with her today . 
no Candy . 
Jo's house see Candy . 
that's right . 
you've remembered „ haven't you ?

when we were going to Jo's house one day . 
I don't even think it was <Jo's house> [>] . 
saw Candy . 
yes . 
we were going to the toddler group .

when you woke up +/. [+ IN] 
you were really unhappy .

I'm so sorry , darling . 
that was yesterday . 
and we missed it . 
you'll hafta wait +/. [+ IN] 
pardon ? 
Felix ? 
Felix ? 
milk all gone ? 
I thought you were talking about Felix and some milk . 
but it sounds like you're talking about milk that you drank . 
I'm sitting on one of your little chairs . 
so are you bringing your table up to sit next to me ? 
oh Mummy's just polishing shoes at the moment . 
you +//. [+ IN] 
that's right . 
you put the telephone on my knee . 
I can't touch anything though , Thomas . 
because I've got blue shoe polish . 
I thought we could do this little job while we're talking . 
and don't let's forget to go to the post box . 
otherwise there'll be trouble . 
can you get in , sweetheart ? 
we've got two letters to post „ haven't we ? 
both in brown envelopes . 
so they're not nice letters „ are they ? 
oh you've picked up your Postman_Pat book „ have you ? 
Jess and the postman ? 
who else can you see ? 
they're twins . 
I haven't really read the book very often . 
so I can't remember everybody's names . 
but I think the twins +//. [+ IN] 
it's a boy and a girl . 
I think they're called Tom and Katie . 
and that lady's called Granny_Dryden . 
I think in the story it was her birthday „ wasn't it ? 
and everybody was going to her door with letters and parcels +/. [+ IN] 
+, and presents . 
well looking through the window of a house it looks like a birthday tea . 
oh . 
you've pressed the button now . 
you going to sing along ? 
more presents ? 
can you see a girl standing at the back of the queue ? 
do we take presents when we go to birthday partys ? 
in fact you've been invited to another one on Saturday afternoon „ haven't you ? 
at the Wacky_Warehouse (.) this time . 
so would you like to go to Matthew's party ? 
that's a little boy . 
that's Tom . 
and he looks like he's putting milk on the floor for Jess the pussy cat „ doesn't he ? 
looking at the picture +//. [+ IN] 
I think when Postman_Pat arrives at the house the twins are having their breakfast . 
well you tell me what it is . 
a bowl of Cornflakes . 
that's right . 
you like pressing the button and listening to the music „ don't you ? 
can you see a policeman on that page ? 
stop ? 
yes . 
he's holding his hands up . 
I think he is saying stop „ isn't he ? 
it says all the children walk to school . 
Pat waits while I cross the road . [+ R] 
so it looks as if the policeman (h)as put his hands up to stop traffic . 
and Postman_Pat (h)as hadta stop to let the children cross the road .

Mummy's going to work tomorrow „ isn't she ? 
going to work tomorrow .

open wide ? 
<Daddy (h)as had> [<] to go to the dentist today „ hasn't he ?

were you going to get the vacuum cleaner and brush Dobbin's hair ?

oh well . 
his hair isn't wet .

you'd use the hairdryer . 
like Mummy uses the hairdryer . 
you've seen Mummy use the hairdryer „ haven't you ?

I keep yawning .

are you posting them through the handle at the side ? 
they just fit through there nicely „ don't they ? 
it's the big envelope „ isn't it ? 
a big red envelope . 
are you having to fold it in half to get it through the letterbox ? 
have you got to fold it up to get it through the letterbox , Thomas ? 
that's the white envelope . 
with lots_of red writing on it . 
is Brian finished yet ? 
can you see him ? 
when we're upstairs we usually have the bedroom window open . 
you can see Brian and talk to him „ can't you ? 
but I think he's too far away at the front . 
he can't hear you . 
and we haven't got the window open . 
anyway he looks as if he's busy . 
he maybe doesn't want anybody to talk to him while he's busy , Thomas . 
is Felix there with him ? 
what are you saying about walking this way round ? 
a car coming ? 
something about Felix . 
Maria (h)as come home .

I've not seen her at all today . 
have you seen her ? 
see you in the morning ? 
we went to Sue's house on Sunday „ didn't we ? 
what's Brian doing ? 
is he still doing the garden ? 
is he snipping trees ? 
top leaf ? 
or chop leaf ? 
chop leaf ? 
he's chopping the leaves „ is he ? 
with his scissors . 
his secateurs@s:fra . 
hello , Thomas . 
steady now . 
I've not been anywhere , darling . 
where've you been ? 
have you been watching through the window ? 
watching what's going on . 
where (h)as the blue car gone ? 
I don't know . 
is it still in the window ledge ? 
you're not wanting me to go and get it „ are you ? 
no , Thomas . 
where (h)as the blue car gone ? 
there we are . 
Thomas <little mouse> [?] has lovely clean shoes now . 
can you not find it ? 
have you looked in the toy box ? 
we had it before you went to sleep . 
oh that's right . 
of course Mummy tidied up while you were asleep . 
the blue car's a bit poorly „ isn't it ? 
because I think the window (h)as come away . 
and the roof (h)as come off . 
I'm just going to wash my hands , Thomas . 
you talk to Brian through the window . 
the sun was out before . 
but it (h)as gone cloudy again „ hasn't it ? 
because I was just thinking if we go to the post box we could come back and have some tea . 
and then we might go to the park . 
oh look . 
Felix's on the other side of the road . 
can you see him rubbing his chin on the pavement ? 
on the footpath ? 
and Brian's pulling some weeds out of his flower bed now . 
the blue car's a bit poorly „ isn't it ? 
and this morning you came to me with the windscreen in your hands . 
the front window had come out as well . 
you've had it a long time though , Thomas . 
it's the first car you had . 
and it (h)as been dropped and thrown about „ hasn't it ? 
has the wheel broken ? 
wave at the taxi ? 
the taxi (h)as just pulled up . 
that's Les in his taxi „ isn't it ? 
are you waving at him ? 
do you think he'll wave back ? 
Felix is sitting in the middle of the road . 
the blue car's poorly „ isn't it ? 
poor blue car . 
the wheels are fine . 
you said the wheels weren't working . 
but they are „ aren't they ?

the wheels are still going round and round , Thomas . 
oh [<] that back one's not working very well „ is it ? 
here you are . 
working perfectly well now . 
the blue car is a bit poorly „ isn't it ? 
well I was just a bit worried then because a car just drove past . 
and I didn't see what happened to Felix . 
he looked like he came into the road . 
where did Felix go , Thomas ? 
what happened to Felix ? 
is the man getting out of his taxi ? 
I don't know , love . 
I think he must be alright because Uncle_Brian's out there . 
and he hasn't moved „ has he ? 
I thought he would have done if something had happened to Felix . 
the bin bag lorry no find him ? 
oh I'm sure we'll find Felix again . 
he'll be back in a minute . 
he's alright , Thomas . 
Felix is alright . 
yes . 
he'll be back in a minute . 
Mummy (h)as just had a look out of the bedroom window . 
and Felix is hiding underneath Mark's car . 
so he must be quite sensible where cars are concerned . 
he saw a car coming . 
and he must have run backwards underneath the car out of the way . 
because Felix like you hasta be very careful on the roads . 
although it's quiet there's a lot of traffic +//. [+ IN]

I'm just about to put your shoes on . 
I'm putting my shoes on .

we've got two letters to post „ haven't we ?

the big box ? 
has Daddy come home with a big box as well ? 
oh dear , Thomas . 
look . 
there's a poorly man over there . 
he's on crutches . 
he must have hurt his leg . 
I wonder if he got that leg jumping on chairs and falling off ? 
yes . 
like that . 
no [<] . 
up in the air . 
well it's alright as long as you keep going up in the air . 
it's when you fall off +/. [+ IN] 
just a second . 
we've got to go out as well now „ haven't we , Thomas ? 
don't . 
please don't jump . 
that blue car doesn't sound very healthy „ does it ? 
no go ? 
well something (h)as happened to the wheels . 
I think you're pressing down on it too much , Thomas . 
it's the back wheels . 
something (h)as happened to the back wheels . 
<I think you'll find> [<] as long as you don't press down +//. [+ IN] 
so we went to the post box . 
and we didn't see the postman „ did we ? 
but he +/. [+ IN] 
Christopher . 
and Christopher's Mummy and Daddy . 
they were in the garden . 
and Christopher and his Daddy came to the post box with us „ didn't they ? 
and what happened when they got home ? 
Christopher went in the house crying „ didn't he ? 
no . 
he didn't have a sore knee . 
he was in trouble . 
that's why he went in crying . 
because +/. [+ IN] 
he walked over one of the neighbors garden . 
and trod on a plant . 
and his Daddy told him not to do it . 
and he went back and did it again „ didn't he ? 
so he +/. [+ IN] 
so he got into trouble „ didn't he ? 
well he fell over , Thomas . 
but he hadn't got a sore knee properly . 
he fell over and started to cry . 
he wanted the sympathy vote . 
you do that sometimes „ don't you ? 
do you remember that day you fell off your bicycle ? 
and I looked out of the window . 
and you were lying on the floor with your bicycle on top of you crying . 
and I went rushing out . 
and Uncle_Brian said not to worry because he (h)ad seen you . 
and he was staring at the kitchen window . 
and when Mummy didn't come you tipped your bicycle upside down and then started to cry . 
and do you remember that ? 
yes . 
I remember that . 
Thomas you're going to damage that . 
you mustn't do that . 
you mustn't press down . 
you're on the window ledge and you're going to damage the paintwork . 
just do it gently . 
if you do it gently the wheels work . 
it's when you press it down it doesn't work . 
why don't you do it on the floor ? 
or use something else . 
use a different xxx . [+ PI] 
big bang ?

so when we saw Christopher Christopher wanted to come to the post box . 
and his Mummy said no@q because she hadn't time to take him . 
so we said we'd take him . 
and then his Daddy came home from work and his Daddy took him . 
yes . 
his Daddy has glass on „ doesn't he ? 
Christopher's Mummy and Daddy both wear glass „ don't they ? 
your Mummy and Daddy both wear glass .

I'll knock on the window .

no . 
she'll come in when she's ready „ won't she ? 
she'll come in when she's ready . 
perhaps when she's hungry at teatime . 
or perhaps when she's tired and she wants a little sleep in a bed . 
it's the sort of time you come in „ isn't it ? 
well the sunshine didn't last very long today „ did it ? 
no orange digger ?

but we've got to go to see Christopher at his house before he goes to school „ haven't we ? 
no . 
Purdie (h)as gone now . 
I'm not carrying you in there , Thomas . 
because you can't stand in the window . 
no . 
upstairs [>] +/. [+ IN]

that lady's coming home in a big red sports car „ isn't she ? 
can you hear that ? 
what is it ? 
the ice cream bus one ? 
is it the ice cream bus tune ?

can you see that lady going into her house ?
