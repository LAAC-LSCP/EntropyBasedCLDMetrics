two ladders and two wheels .

and I can only see one ladder . 
oh no . 
well I can see a ladder and a chair lift . 
right . 
would you like some Rice_Krispies ? 
a biscuit . 
you want a biscuit for breakfast . 
you're only saying you want a biscuit because you can see I've got them on the table „ haven't I ? 
I'm putting some in the tin there before Grandma and Grandad come . 
putting them in the tin . 
oh you're talking about Reverend_Timms [?] again „ are you ?

and there's a piece of Grandad xxx birthday cake „ isn't there ? [+ I] 
no . 
you're not touching it . 
actually we've got masses of biscuits . 
I don't know why I've just opened a new packet .

I don't like that . 
it's naughty . 
you don't wanna be a naughty boy today „ do you ? 
at playgroup yesterday you were playing with a fire engine „ weren't you ? 
two ladders . 
it had very big ladders „ didn't it ? 
and then we went in for storytime „ didn't we ? 
I think you were a bit disappointed because you (h)ad only just discovered the fire engine . 
when they shouted story time . 
and I think you wanted to carry on playing with the fire engine „ didn't you ? 
never mind . 
I'm going to make you some toast now , Thomas . 
do you think you will be going into Stockport today or John_Lewis ? 
no . 
you usually do „ don't you ? 
but not today you don't think . 
pardon . 
John_Lewis is shut . 
oh no . 
it's only shut on Mondays , sweetheart . 
and Grandma and Grandad said they were going to take you today to buy you some new shoes . 
what do you think to that ? 
that sounds nice „ doesn't it ? 
new shoes for Thomas . 
lucky boy „ aren't you ? 
shoes for +/. [+ N] 
more biscuits . 
would you not like some Rice_Krispies ? 
you would . 
well I think that's the better option than biscuits for breakfast . 
I've put some toast in the machine as well . 
you can have that with some marmalade „ can't you ? 
we'll put some milk on your Rice_Krispies this morning . 
and what (h)as happened to your drink of juice ? 
we had it „ didn't we ? 
a while a go . 
oh it's here . 
look . 
there we are . 
where (h)as the lock gone for the fridge , Thomas ? 
oh it's inside the fridge . 
fair enough . 
do you feel any better today ? 
no better . 
you're poorly .

you have been poorly for the past few days „ haven't you ? 
you've had a bad cold . 
oh dear dear . 
poor old Thomas . 
I think you're getting a bit better now though „ aren't you ? 
is Thomas feeling better now ? 
that sounded like a car pulling up . 
no . 
it wasn't . 
no car pulling up . 
that's a funny noise but it's not the noise from the Rice_Krispies . 
it's the air trapped in your juice beaker „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
is that what it's doing ? 
making a squeaky sound . 
&=laughs . 
you're very dramatic , Thomas . 
yes . 
alright . 
we got the picture . 
Postman_Pat . 
did you see our Postman this morning ? 
I thought you had . 
what happened to the letters ? 
two Postman_Pats . 
you saw the real life Postman_Pat and you saw the Postman_Pat on television . 
two Postman_Pats . 
sorry , poppet . 
has he finished ? 
asleep . 
does he ? 
did you have a nice night's sleep ? 
yes . 
you woke up „ didn't you ? 
when I came to bed . 
what a night last night . 
Mummy got into bed and Daddy put the pillow on her face . 
Daddy was still asleep but I hadta wake him up to move him . 
then Purdie was sick . 
I cleaned that up . 
and I got back into bed and I said to Daddy what's the beting Thomas wakes up within the next few minutes ? 
and just as I said it guess what ? 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
excuse me . 
you woke up (..) shouting Mummy [/] Mummy . 
who woke up shouting Mummy [/] Mummy ? 
yes . 
like that . 
pardon . 
you came into Mummy and Daddy's bed „ didn't you ? 
well we didn't actually . 
Daddy got up and came down here „ didn't he ? 
we were all awake then . 
why are you shouting ? 
why are you shouting , Thomas ? 
you shouldn't shout . 
right . 
where's the bin bag lorry ? 
are you implying my kitchen looked messy ? 
&=laughs . 
yes . 
well <we're trying> [/] we're trying to get it tidied up . 
Mummy (h)as got to get ready for work in a minute . 
I've got to +/. [+ N] 
yes . 
the ice cream bus . 
well I really don't know what you're talking about now . 
an ice cream bus and a red bus . 
I think Mummy will pour herself a cup of tea (.) and I'll get something to eat before I iron a skirt . 
Mummy's going to wear a skirt today , Thomas . 
a Rice_Krispie . 
what do you say about the Rice_Krispie ? 
you've found a Rice_Krispie . 
where did you find it ? 
on the table . 
had you dropped it out of the bowl ? 
landed on the table . 
Grandma and Grandad are calling into the shops on the way here today to buy Purdie some food . 
because when I went to feed her I realized that we hadn't got any Whiskas . 
no Whiskas . 
we (h)ad run out of Whiskas , Thomas . 
all done Whiskas . 
tin of pussy cat food . 
Purdie (h)as got whiskers on her face „ hasn't she ? 
what else has she got ? 
oh no . 
don't say that about Purdie . 
no . 
she hasn't . 
she's a little girl . 
she's a pussy cat . 
yes . 
that's right . 
she says she's a little girl pussy cat not a little boy pussy cat . 
we'll hafta try and find a fire engine that has an Open_Day soon , Thomas . 
and take you to it . 
well there was one a few weeks ago and we were away at the time . 
something like that . 
we were going away . 
we didn't find out about it until afterwards . 
would you like to go and have a look at a real fire engine ? 
because you like buss and we've been on a bus . 
you like trains and we've been to the Station . 
we've been on a train . 
and you like aeroplanes and we've been to the airport and on an aeroplane . 
we don't really want a fire engine coming to the house „ do we ? 
because that'll mean there's big trouble . 
it's better if we can go and see a fire engine at the fire station . 
right . 
is Mummy allowed to sit down with you a few moments and have some breakfast ? 
we get worse on Wednesdays , Thomas „ don't we ? 
rushing . 
rush [/] rush [/] rush . 
is that all we ever do ? 
rush [/] rush [/] rush . 
what a rush . 
so I'll leave that tray , Thomas . 
with Purdie's water bowl on it and a plate and a fork and then when Grandma comes with the pussy cat food we can feed her „ can't we ? 
and if Mummy forgets Grandma can feed her and you can show her where the things are . 
you can say that's Purdie's water bowl . 
this is Purdie's plate . 
and this is the fork we use . 
I can't see the fork . 
yes . 
I can . 
here we are . 
that very big one . 
is the toast nice ? 
is it not nice ? 
dirty . 
it's not dirty . 
it (h)as got Marmite on it . 
I was just shaking the duster outside because I used it last night . 
when I went to shake it the phone rang and I just left it on the washing machine . 
it's very windy out there this morning . 
it nearly blew me away . 
very windy . 
I bet there'll be a lot of leaves falling of the trees this morning . 
your swing's blowing in the breeze . 
can you see it ? 
and if you look out of the front window can you see all the leaves blowing of those trees near Sue's house ? 
more leaves falling . 
yes . 
it's nice to watch them „ isn't it ? 
another leaf fall over too . 
off Thomas's trees . 
yes . 
we've been watching leaves falling off the trees near Sue's house and when we look out of the patio door we can see falling off our own trees „ can't we ? 
do you remember going for that walk and picking up all the leaves ? 
and we collected some from Jo and Becky's house „ didn't we ? 
and some from our own garden (.) and some from the park when we were walking back from toddler group . 
your nose sounds very blocked up , Thomas . 
when you start to eat . 
are you stuffed up ? 
little nose blocked . 
oh look I've just seen some more marks on the tablecloth . 
that must be out of the green paper . 
we used green yellow and red paper . 
or was it green blue and red paper „ wasn't it ? 
and we used yellow paper but that was to cut a shape „ wasn't it ? 
pardon . 
it's dye from the red paper . 
it (h)as marked the cloth . 
I think it'll come out when we dry clean it . 
Postman_Pat . 
Postman_Pat's not on now „ is he ? 
is the toast nice ? 
no . 
Mummy made it especially for Thomas .
