I made a cup of coffee so I'm going to sit (.) and watch you have your bath . 
yes darling [>] . 
if I get bored do I wanna play with that ? 
well I will do yes . 
it's a lifeboat „ isn't it ? 
but it's not so +/. [+ IN] 
oh , what's that ? 
oh a Bug (.) that's right . 
this is a beetle or something like a beetle „ isn't it ? 
and you can fill that with water as well can't you and squirt that . 
no [/] not up there then . 
just squirt it back into the bath water . 
well yes or onto yourself . 
pardon [>] ? 
have you ? 
I said it's a life boat but I don't know what sort of boat it is really . 
it could be something like a naval ship because look . 
well I thought it was . 
but if you're giving me this to play with (.) this is an aeroplane . 
and &-um it could be an aircraft carrier „ couldn't it ? 
it's big enough to have an aircraft on board . 
what was that ? 
when someone wants a drink of water in the babbling seas ? 
yes . 
do you ? 
so when somebody wants a drink in the middle of the ocean . 
you say “open your mouth” . 
and you squirt your water [/] water jet into the mouth „ do you ? 
was it fresh water not sea water ? 
oh [<] fresh water that sounds good . 
&-uh [<] no thank you I think I'll stick with my cup of coffee . 
thank you for asking that's kind of you . 
yes . 
I think you're alright thank you very much . 
is he ? 
that's right the mixer from the building site . 
he's got a little face on him „ hasn't he ? 
do you think he's a thirsty [?] one or can he drink ? 
and what about the duck ? 
does he not ? 
right . 
well Guzzle_the_Teletubbie is here look . 
we've got all the Teletubbies in Dipsy's Hat . 
do you think they might want a drink ? 
come on let's sit them on this [/] this little sponge . 
who's first ? 
can it ? 
there's Tinky_Winky . 
there's Dipsy . 
who's next ? 
La_La ? 
oops a day quick rescue . 
Dipsy's in the water [>] . 
oh Po's in the &wat [//] Po's jumped in to rescue Dipsy . 
have you rescued them ? 
oh . 
Dipsy's gone straight back in . 
oh that's right . 
are they having a lie down now in the hospital ? 
there we are . 
they look quite funny „ don't they those two ? 
are you giving them all a little wash ? 
is it a wash or is it a drink you're giving them [>] . 
a [<] drink . 
right . 
well Dipsy and Po I think are in the hospital look lying down . 
xxx [>] . 
I think they need Lucozade not water if they're in hospital „ don't you ? 
give them some energy and make them feel a little bit better . 
be careful now , Tom , with that . 
you don't need a squirter „ don't you ? 
okay . 
and what's the Life_Boat going to do now ? 
so if anybody's in trouble it hoots his horn and tells them to get out of the way . 
well surely if anybody's in trouble (.) he should approach them gently and help them „ shouldn't he ? 
where's his crane ? 
at the end ? 
oh right . 
what does it do ? 
throws them down there ? 
and what's inside the Life_Boat ? 
is there a nice warm bed ? 
for people that it's rescued out of the sea [>] . 
yes [>] . 
will you ? 
thing is though if you've just been rescued from the sea you'd be cold and wet „ wouldn't you ? 
do you think it might be nicer to have a nice warm bath like you're having now ? 
rescue them from the sea . 
give them a nice warm bath . 
and then wrap them up in a fluffy towel . 
dry them . 
put them in warm pyjamas . 
and put them into a nice bed . 
with a hot water bottle and a nice warm drink . 
does that sound like +/. [+ IN] 
the sort of +... 
you don't do drinks oh . 
if they want a drink (.) they just get water squirted at them „ do they ? 
yeah . 
even if they've been (.) in the sea for a long time . 
and they're cold and wet ? 
they can but they get it squirted at them ? 
oh I see so if you squirt the water . 
and it drizzles [//] dribbles down them . 
one of the captains gives them a nice fluffy towel . 
yes . 
<would it not be easier> [>] . 
who's in trouble ? 
Dipsy and Po . 
would it not just be kinder to give them a nice warm drink in a cup ? 
oh dear . 
I think Dipsy's alright (be)cause he's floating on his back . 
but Po's lying face down . 
I think you'd better rescue her first . 
ah well she seems to have come round nicely . 
oh you're right it can fly . 
where's it flying to ? 
pardon ? 
oh I see . 
does it get them out of the sea and to bring them up to land ? 
it flies . 
it sounds like Chitty_Chitty_Bang_Bang the car . 
it sounds like Chitty_Chitty_Bang_Bang . 
that's a car that can fly . 
that car doesn't get stuck in traffic jams . 
it can be tootling down the road . 
and there's a traffic jam ahead . 
and it just puts out its wings and flies up in the air . 
fly's right across all the people queuing . 
is that what your boat's doing ? 
that must mean somebody's in trouble . 
it's parking up . 
oh that's a nice <little boat> [>] . 
he needs rescuing quick before he gets stuck on the rocks . 
you'd better watch out for icebergs as well , Thomas . 
pardon ? 
it's not Christmas so you don't think there's any icebergs then it's not Christmas . 
can you ? 
yeah . 
that's right . 
if you get stuck on the rocks you can fly straight back out into the ocean „ can't you ? 
oh_gosh you are clever . 
La_La looks like he's about to fall [//] or she's about to fall . 
that's right . 
here she is . 
oh straight on to the life boat . 
how nice . 
oh the life boat's flown . 
looks like Dipsy's about to fall in [//] not Dipsy Tinky_Winky . 
oh he's in [//] is he visitting the others ? 
is he going to see how Po +/? 
and Dipsy and La_La are ? 
do you think he's taken them some grapes to the hospital ? 
and some chocolates ? 
and some Lucozade ? 
and a card ? 
<well that should cheer> [>] . 
and some strawberries . 
well that should cheer them up „ shouldn't it ? 
very nice . 
what's happening now ? 
right . 
two people in trouble over there ? 
in the red and the blue boat ? 
pardon ? 
one you built ? 
you built it ? 
what did you build ? 
oh right [>] . 
it's your home ? 
well there seems to be two boats behind you . 
oh Tinky_Winky's coming back from the hospital . 
and he's (.) oops . 
La_La's fallen in the water . 
Tinky's in the water . 
Dipsy . 
Po . 
well they've all fallen in the water . 
oh now there's a big disaster . 
the aeroplane . 
it's crashed into the sea . 
can he fly out ? 
what if there are people inside trapped ? 
it can fly (be)cause look . 
oh yes . 
the Teletubbies don't look very well at the side of the bath . 
do they ? 
they look that [*] like they've all fallen out of the aeroplane . 
oops . 
what's happening now ? 
but what about the Teletubbies they don't look at all well , Thomas . 
just leave them ? 
does that mean he's realized and he's going back for them ? 
oh no . 
so the life boat itself is in trouble now . 
aah . 
it's a good job it can fly . 
it looks like a fish darting in and out of the water . 
doesn't it ? 
is your water still warm enough ? 
doesn't feel all that hot now , love . 
I don't want you getting cold . 
oh is that the submarine , Thomas ? 
he's like a submarine . 
submarines stay under water „ don't they ? 
and then when they come up to the surface they come up with a big fush@o . 
like a whale or a shark coming up . 
have you not seen pictures of submarines on the television ? 
no . 
and they make funny noises little poop@o .

I'll hafta see who is next to picture [*] the submarine . 
on the news or on the television .

that sounded like a noisy boy playing with his boat in the bath . 
0 [=! chuckles] . 
oh right . 
and what color is the big life boat ? 
I will . 
I think that's Thomas Lastname's life boat . 
xxx [<] .

whitawoo@o . 
when you go and stay with Nana and Grandpa Lastname you sometimes go towards Fleetwood „ don't you ? 
what do you see there ?

was it really loud [>] ? 
did [<] it ? 
was it so loud ?

and how many lorries did you see ?

I went [>] . 
+, on a very big ferry once . 
somewhere near Glasgow . 
I can't even remember where we were going to . 
oh I've never seen anything like it , Thomas . 
there were cars . 
you wouldn't believe how many cars they parked on a ship . 
well it was just like being in a multistory car park . 
but it was inside a ship . 
it was absolutely fabulous +/. [+ IN] 
oh_gosh is he still able to fly ? 
oh it is like a space rocket . 
it even looks like a space rocket . 
with [/] with the water drips off the boat . 
as you bring it in the air it looks like +...[+ IN] 
+, steam or smoke coming out of the bottom of the space rocket „ doesn't it ? 
the drips are fire . 
that's what I said it looks like smoke „ doesn't it ? 
I'll try not to I'll remember that +/. [+ PI] [+ IN] 
and where's the space rocket going to ? 
is it ? 
and is there anybody on board ? 
the captain of the ship ? 
does that mean we're going to the moon ? 
goodness me he leads an exciting life „ doesn't he ? 
back into the sea where he belongs . 
looks like a submarine now going underneath the water . 
what did we see when we were at York station ? 
it also goes under water . 
the Euro_Star . 
it doesn't actually go underwater but it goes through the tunnel . 
it's surrounded by water isn't it ? 
and what color was the Euro_Star ? 
can you not remember ? 
yellow and white . 
did it have blue on it ? 
did it ? 
oh dear he's gone under the water . 
and come out without some of his +... [+ IN] 
+, roof . [+ IN] 
<so if> [>] somebody wants to go to sleep they take the entire roof off the boat . 
I'm not sure that the Teletubbies are going to ride in that boat properly . 
no . 
it's just that the Teletubbies <would be> [?] ideal . 
but they're not the right size . 
look . 
and they look <as if> [>] they are in need of a lift . 
oh right . 
very nice . 
they'll be nice and snug in there „ won't they ? 
they look like xxx on the boat . 
they're hiding . 
oh there's only Tinky_Winky left now .
