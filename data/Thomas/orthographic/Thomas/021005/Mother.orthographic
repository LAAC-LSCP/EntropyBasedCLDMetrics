when you were a baby we had that cupboard through there . 
and then about the time +//. [+ IN] 
I can't actually remember what happened when you started walking . 
I don't think you really tried to open the cupboards . 
I can't remember . 
but then we had the fireplace put in „ didn't we ? 
you hadn't been walking all that long when we had the fireplace put in . 
and we moved that cupboard through here and we let you play with it . 
and you've played with it ever since „ haven't you ?

I don't think you know what you mean either „ do you ? 
oh is that what the dustbin wagon said ? 
is that noise he makes when he's lifting up the bags ? 
we saw him yesterday „ didn't we ? 
and going to toddler group this morning we saw all the bin bags out on the other housing estate . 
so we know that they have their bins emptied today . 
actually what we should do , Thomas . 
we should have a little walk up there later on . 
because we know that they weren't collected when we came home about twelve o'clock . 
it was about between twelve and half past when we came home . 
no we didn't manage to get it on tape yesterday „ did we ? 
yes that's right . 
because we'd just come home . 
after Jo and Becky had finished their lunch . 
we all walked to their house „ didn't we ? 
to pick up the dogs . 
to take the dog for a walk . 
and then when we were walking home we heard the dustbin lorry . 
and we'd just walked in the door when he arrived . 
so you watched him from the window but we hadn't got time to set a tape up yesterday „ had we ? 
like we normally do . 
we hadta do it much later on . 
after the dustbin man had gone home . 
but you saw him yesterday „ didn't you ? 
what have you done ? 
put your Quavers all round the side of your plate ?

the sausage rolls are houses . 
well it's a sausage roll cut into pieces . 
and the Quavers are dust(b)in bags . 
well [?] that's very exciting „ isn't it ? 
we've got some little cakes that need eating up , Thomas . 
we've got Sonia and Isabel coming on Thursday . 
I'll just have a look at these cakes and see if I think they're going to keep . 
and if they're not I might put them in the freezer . 
what date is it today , Thomas ? 
you've had Quavers . 
is that what the fire engine said ? 
well where's the fire ? 
up here ?

it goes round and round . 
we saw a cement mixer this morning „ didn't we ? 
just one . 
what was near it ? 
a skip . 
did the skip have a lot of bricks on it ? 
no . 
don't bang the dish . 
is it a firework ? 
no you mustn't . 
oh yes . 
I see what you mean . 
I think it's the air trapped in the beaker and it's making that sort of whoosh noise . 
isn't it ? 
that the firework makes . 
don't keep banging it , Thomas . 
the lid'll come off . 
no . 
no .

Daddy's six „ is he ?

her birthday's in October . 
and so does Uncle_David and Aunty_Sharon . 
and David . 
and then in December it's Grandma and Purdie . 
but you're the first one in the year two thousand . 
you're Bella „ are you ?

Charlotte will be two . 
Ben's three .

never mind . 
who's going to sweep it up ? 
Noo_Noo the vacuum cleaner .

ah . 
I'm not going to sweep Purdie all up . 
no . 
Purdie's my little pal . 
Grandad's pal . 
you're Grandad's pal now „ aren't you ? 
but if I sweep Purdie all up I won't have a pussy cat . 
that would make me very sad . 
I'd be more than cross . 
I'll be very very upset when anything happens to Purdie . 
who doesn't like me ? 
you don't like me . 
my hair's like a sausage . 
oh well I'm sorry . 
I will cry if you keep saying things like that to me . 
it's very upsetting . 
no . 
don't touch xxx . [+ PI]

that's not pleasant .

<we do that at night „ don't we> [<] ? 
is Daddy blue as well ? 
we do this at night „ don't we ? 
when you're going to bed . 
you often tell me that you're a snake . 
and I say +"/. [+ IN] 
+" what color is the snake ? 
and you say “I'm purple” and Mummy goes ugh . 
I don't like the thought of sharing a bed with a purple snake . 
you're a purple snake now ? 
you're not Bella you're a purple snake „ are you ? 
I've only got one thing to say to that . 
ugh ! 
you're putting your tongue out . 
ooh . 
put your tongue out again . 
what an awful color . 
oh it's the blackcurrant juice . 
I thought you'd got some deadly disease (be)cause your tongue (h)as gone black . 
I've just realized what it is . 
it's your blackcurrant juice . 
it (h)as made your tongue go a very dark purple black color . 
ugh . 
you came into Mummy and Daddy's bed this morning „ didn't you ? 
about quarter to five . 
I didn't know you were there till I woke up this morning . 
did Daddy lift you in ? 
did Daddy bring you through or did you come on your own ? 
did you come through on your own ? 
because Daddy said it was quarter to five this morning . 
did you wake Daddy up when you came in ? 
what did you say to him ? 
oh_gosh . 
no wonder he woke up . 
I didn't hear you . 
what can you see ?

and I don't mean trouble naughty trouble . 
if ever you got lost or you needed any help . 
a policeman's a really good man to ask . 
so don't be frightened of policeman „ will you ? 
because policeman only put naughty boys in the back of the van . 
and as long as you're being a good boy they're going to be nice to you „ aren't they ? 
so if ever you get lost . 
if ever anything happened like we were shopping together and you ran away from Mummy and got lost . 
don't ever be frightened of a policeman „ will you ? 
go up to him and say I've lost my mummy . 
because they'll be very kind to boys who are not naughty . 
so if ever you need help ask a policeman . 
yeah . 
well you could ask Mummy .

you could tell the policeman if a big bear ate Mummy all up . 
I'd be quite glad if you told the policeman .

+" Mister Lastname what was the big bear like that ate your Mummy up ? 
and you'd hafta give them a big description „ wouldn't you ? 
ooh . 
well if Mummy's hair looks like a sausage that's perhaps why the [/] the bear ate me up . 
because it didn't realize . 
thought I was a big juicy sausage . 
yes . 
but as I say , Thomas . 
if you need a policeman <they they> [/] they put naughty boys in the back of their van but they're very very happy to help good boys . 
they talk to good boys . 
so you could talk to them „ couldn't you ? 
pardon ? 
I'm not quite sure what you're saying . 
no [/] no . 
we once last summer we got in the back of a police van „ didn't we ? 
(be)cause we saw the policeman and the fire engine and the ambulance . 
and the policeman put you in the back of his van and he said +"/. [+ N] 
+" I never wanna see you in one of these again . 
didn't he ? 
do you remember ? 
that was the day we got the little tortoise that sits outside „ wasn't it ? 
do you remember in the summer ? 
oh we were looking at the tortoise yesterday „ weren't we ? 
is it your little friend ? 
what were you going to the [/] the tortoise ? 
(be)cause I said Freddie and you said no . 
you came up with a name . 
what was it ? 
Aunty sausage man . 
we can't call the tortoise Aunty sausage man . 
but you did say something like that . 
you did say sausage man „ didn't you ? 
well <shall we call> [/] shall we call the tortoise a sausage man . 
because then when you're grown up we can still talk about the sausage man and it'll <remind me of Mummy> [//] remind Mummy of all the time that you asked for sausages and talked about sausages . 
bit embarrassing though when friends ask you what your tortoise is called and you say sausage man . 
if you've finished shall I go and get La_La for you ? 
going to ask her to wake up ? 
aah . 
ah do you know . 
it's beautiful and sunny through there , Thomas . 
it's not really too good through here but through there +/. [+ IN] 
+, the sun's shining . 
policeman's looking at nice La_La ? 
yes . 
La_La's nice „ isn't she ? 
I bet La_La's not naughty . 
“hello La_La” the policeman said to La_La . 
that's a good one . 
oh yes . 
La_La (h)as got a pocket „ hasn't she ? 
La_La (h)as got a bag at the back . 
there you are . 
you've got all the Teletubbies now . 
<all four> [<] of them . 
Tinky_Winky asked the policeman what La_La was doing down on the floor ? 
and what did you say ? 
what was La_La doing on the floor ? 
looking at your crumbs ? 
yes you have made a few crumbs „ haven't you ? 
look . 
there's your police car there as well . 
oh what's Tinky_Winky telling you ? 
what's he telling you ? 
good words ? 
is he ? 
aah . 
oh that's so sweet . 
you gave Tinky_Winky a cuddle . 
shall I cuddle Tinky_Winky ? 
aah . 
hello Tinky_Winky . 
you're calling Dipsy Aunty_Dipsy ? 
is [/] is he alright ? 
aah you look sweet with Dipsy . 
who brought Tinky_Winky for you ? 
Aunty_Dipsy . 
who did &-uh Tinky_Winky come to you <(.)> [>] from ? 
that doesn't sound right . 
who brought Tinky_Winky for you I should say ? 
no . 
Father_Christmas brought Tinky_Winky „ didn't he ? 
Father_Christmas brought Po the first Christmas we had you . 
but that's the Po that sits in your cot . 
this is a different Po . 
you got one Po upstairs for Christmas . 
and then you got this Po for your birthday „ didn't you ? 
and then you got Dipsylast year . 
you got little Po for the first Christmas . 
you got big Po for your first birthday . 
you got Dipsy for your second birthday . 
you kiss [/] kissed Dipsy's hair ? 
then you got Tinky_Winky at Christmas . 
well I think we got La_La when we were on holiday . 
(be)cause La_La's a little backpack . 
Daddy bought you Dipsy [//] &-uh La_La „ didn't he ? 
so that you could <spill your drink> [?] . 
what do you want La_La to do ? 
to sit on the back of the police car ? 
she's a bit big . 
aah don't put her on the floor , Thomas . 
not in the crumbs . 
that's not nice . 
poor La_La . 
poor La_La . 
are you going to tell <Dimitra Mummy (h)as got a cold> [>] ? 
where's it very dark ? 
in the police car ? 
who lives in it ? 
well the naughty boy's in the back . 
and the policeman don't want people to look at them or them to look out . 
so they've got dark windows „ haven't they ? 
has it ? 
looks like an American police car to me . 
it is a nice police car . 
where did you get that from ? 
Isabel's party . 
yes . 
that was one of the prizes „ wasn't it ? 
<because you'd been a good boy> [?] [>] . 
well I washed your hair before going to Isabel's party . 
yes . 
we wash your hair anyway . 
but before you're going to anything special like that we wash your hair „ don't we ? 
yes . 
we went in Daddy's car to Isabel's party . 
it was very windy and wet that day „ wasn't it ? 
where ? 
oh you mean orange paint on the tablecloth ? 
that was from something we were doing way back in October November „ wasn't it ? 
when we were making those leaf pictures . 
do you remember ? 
we were sticking leaves with glue on to some paper . 
and we were sticking some on to some red paper „ weren't we ? 
when the paper got wet with the glue the red dye came out on to the tablecloth . 
but it's fading a lot now „ isn't it ? 
we keep wiping it and it looks more orange than red now . 
it is orange now . 
yes . 
no [/] no . 
the lights on top don't work neither . 
red lights and blue lights . 
<you can see a> [?] black light in the middle . 
do you want your big digger ? 
it's very dusty . 
Thomas Lastname . 
you've just this minute finished you lunch . 
no . 
<no no no no> [/] no . 
no [/] no . 
no . 
you're cheeky asking for your digger and saying you wanna dig something and then suggesting Smarties . 
<no no no no> [/] no . 
cheeky boy . 
you're a cheeky boy . 
aren't you ? 
oh your head feels quite warm . 
are you alright ? 
digging snow ? 
you wanna dig Smarties . 
I think you're so cheeky . 
you told me you'd had enough lunch . 
and suddenly you found room for Smarties . 
yes . 
cheeky boy . 
well I think what we oughta do now is get our coat on and have a little walk out to see if we can see the bin man . 
no . 
and then you can have a Smartie when you come home . 
cheeky . 
cheeky [/] cheeky boy . 
Smarties aren't cheeky . 
you're the cheeky one . 
is it ?
