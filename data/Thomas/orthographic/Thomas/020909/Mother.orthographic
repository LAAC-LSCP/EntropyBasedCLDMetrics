don't touch Purdie . 
hello . 
you're hiding my skirt . 
that's my dressing gown . 
hello , Thomas . 
are you ready for your breakfast ? 
are you ready for your breakfast ? 
are you not talking to me ? 
are you tired ? 
pardon . 
no . 
don't put Purdie underneath my dressing gown . 
no [/] no . 
no . 
come on . 
in your chair please . 
it's breakfast . 
come along quick because we've got to be quick this morning . 
it's Wednesday . 
we're always in a rush on a Wednesday „ aren't we ? 
you wanna tidy your boxes . 
well you can tidy your boxes after breakfast . 
yes . 
you can certainly do it after breakfast . 
but now we're going to have a bite to eat . 
what would you like to eat , Thomas ? 
cornflakes or Rice_Krispies . 
something nice . 
well that is nice . 
<how about> [<] [/] how about Rice_Krispies ? 
no . 
well what would you like instead ? 
some orange juice . 
right . 
well I'll get you some orange juice and then I'll do you some cereal . 
but before I do that I'm just going to pour this tea xxx . [+ I] 
it'll be getting very strong „ wouldn't it ? 
you're joking with Purdie . 
you're kissing her . 
well from a distance Purdie's on the floor . 
you were just blowing kiss on her . 
Purdie's a clever little girl . 
she is a clever little girl „ isn't she ? 
is Mummy a clever little girl ? 
oh why's Mummy clever ? 
Mummy's picking up pictures . 
what do you mean ? 
Mummy's picking up pictures . 
no . 
I don't know either . 
I'm actually undoing a bottle of orange . 
no . 
you can't have Coca_Cola for breakfast . 
Mummy's allowed one but I'm not having it . 
I've just poured myself a cup of tea . 
yes . 
he does . 
but Daddy (h)as gone to work „ hasn't he ? 
and I don't think Daddy has Coca_Cola for breakfast . 
I'm here . 
Daddy's at work . 
what's strong ? 
Daddy or the orange juice . 
nice and strong . 
there you are . 
you can certainly taste the orange . 
it's nice . 
does that taste good ? 
would you like some breakfast , Purdie ? 
she's just sitting there very patiently „ isn't she ? 
Old MacDonald had a farm . 
is that what you're singing ? 
and what did he have on his farm ? 
pardon . 
lots_of MacDonalds . 
Max . 
and Bella . 
no . 
it's usually Old MacDonald has a farm and then he has things like a dog „ doesn't he ? 
with a woof woof here and a woof woof there . 
are you going to sing it again ? 
your Rice_Krispies are crackling and poping . 
can you hear them ? 
snap crackle and +//. [+ N] 
&=laughs . 
you can hear that . 
there you are . 
I think I'll have cornflakes . 
right , Pussy . 
what would you like ? 
she'd like some food . 
she (h)as not really finished what we left her last night „ has she ? 
so I'll put it in a clean plate and put a few biscuits on top . 
and see if she notices . 
hello , Thomas . 
nice to see you as well . 
oh it's always nice to see Purdie „ isn't it ? 
there you are , Puss . 
there you are , sweetheart . 
you're telling her to go and eat her food . 
she must not be feeling hungry because she's looking at it . 
she knows where it is . 
she's not „ is she ? 
I've put some biscuits on it for her . 
when I've finished doing this washing up I'll lift a tin down . 
perhaps she (h)as realizes I haven't got a new tin out of the cupboard and opened a tin . 
perhaps she realizes it's left from last night , Thomas . 
and she's not very happy . 
well if Purdie doesn't eat it and we see the ginger pussy cat we can give it to him „ can't we ? 
I don't think he gets fed properly „ does he ? 
right . 
come along , Purdie . 
come on , poppet . 
ooh that's it . 
there . 
oh she likes that . 
she's eating that „ isn't she ? 
she is a clever girl . 
yes . 
I'm just putting those boxes on the floor , Thomas . 
and we can tidy them away after breakfast „ can't we ? 
is the orange nice , Thomas ? 
is the orange nice ? 
no . 
don't roll it because if the lid comes off and the juice spills there'll be trouble „ won't there ? 
there will . 
you've nearly eaten all your Rice_Krispies . 
are you enjoying them ? 
would you like some more ? 
what do you say ? 
that's better . 
you're so busy drinking you're not talking to me „ are you ? 
it's all very quiet outside „ isn't it ? 
we missed the postman this morning „ didn't we ? 
he (h)ad been by the time we got up . 
what did he bring today ? 
I think it was three . 
it was two letters and a little parcel „ wasn't it ? 
all for Daddy . 
is she eating some of her food now ? 
why don't you save some of that juice till later on , Thomas . 
because you'll be thirsty later on if you drink it all now . 
0 [=! coughs] . 
excuse me . 
come on . 
save some of that orange now till afterwards , Thomas . 
you're drinking it . 
has she finished ? 
bye bye , Purdie . 
I thought she might have wanted to go out but she's walking away from the door „ isn't she ? 
what do you think she's doing ? 
yes . 
she's going upstairs . 
do you think she's going back to bed ? 
yes . 
she's walking very slowly up the stairs . 
that must be nice „ mustn't it ? 
to have your breakfast and go back to bed . 
you don't wanna do that „ do you ? 
oh come on , Thomas . 
leave some of that juice now . 
and when it's all gone there's no more . 
you're only drinking it now because I told you not to „ aren't you ? 
because you keep stopping looking at +... [+ N] 
yes . 
I know exactly what you're doing . 
you keep stopping looking at the beaker to see how much is left and then drinking more . 
I think though sometimes when you've got a cold you do feel a bit more thirsty „ don't you ? 
you're drinking all your drink . 
cheeky „ aren't you ? 
yes . 
and you know it . 
you mean it . 
you mean to be cheeky . 
do you mean to be cheeky ? 
oh it's all gone . 
was it nice to have orange as a change from blackcurrant ? 
you've got it . 
right . 
come on . 
I'll go and wash it up if you've finished . 
what would you like ? 
no . 
you're not having coke . 
you're not having anything else to drink yet xxx . [+ I] 
no . 
have you finished with your Rice_Krispies now , Thomas ? 
what would you like ? 
something to drink . 
oh no . 
you'll be spending all day sitting on the potty if you have something else to [/] to drink (..) <won't you> [>] ? 
here you are . 
would you like one of those ? 
how about an apple or a banana ? 
what would you like ? 
no [/] no . 
you've hardly eaten . 
some bread . 
toast . 
I've discovered that you like mince pies . 
would you like a mince pie for breakfast ? 
no . 
you'd like some skin from the apple . 
there you are . 
would you like a piece of cheese ? 
apple and cheese go nice together . 
you don't fancy that . 
are you not hungry ? 
you're a bit like Purdie this morning „ aren't you ? 
she didn't seem too bothered about her breakfast „ did she ? 
oops a daisy . 
oops a daisy . 
I think we'll hafta go to the shop later to get some more apple . 
Mummy's going to work . 
and then she's coming home . 
and then she's going back again this evening for a couple of hours . 
and Daddy'll be looking after you . 
why are you laughing ? 
Mummy's not laughing . 
poor Mummy . 
you're not laughing . 
you don't like skin . 
you don't like peel from the apple . 
well you asked for it . 
I didn't make you have it . 
I'm not quite sure what I'm going to have now , Thomas . 
Mummy feels quite full after her cornflakes . 
oops a daisy . 
yes . 
I tripped over the kitchen stool . 
what's going round and round and round ? 
is she ? 
you wanna play with your train . 
well let me just wipe your hands . 
have you really [/] really had enough , Thomas ? 
the train's a bit scruffy . 
it is „ isn't it ? 
well . 
that was actually a train that Aunty_Edith gave you . 
and her grandchildren have played with it . 
and they live on a farm and I think they've played with it outside . 
and Grandma (h)as cleaned it up but it still looks a bit grotty . 
and actually just thinking I might give it a good scrub and put it in some Milton . 
yes . 
Milton . 
that'll sort it out „ won't it ? 
it's not nice that train . 
it's a bit scruffy . 
bit scruffy . 
it needs a wipe . 
look [<] . 
if it's a bit dirty don't get it on your food . 
that's not nice „ is it ? 
it is a nice train though , Thomas „ isn't it ? 
what else came with it ? 
that's the lid . 
you don't want it on . 
okay . 
there we are . 
did it have some more pieces ? 
what (h)as happened to them all ? 
they've all gone . 
you need Cranky_the_crane . 
well I think part of the problem is you need a chair moving a little bit nearer the table . 
how's that ? 
is that any better ? 
you can reach more easily . 
oh . 
you slept well last night „ didn't you ? 
oh pardon you . 
what do you say ? 
no . 
excuse me please . 
what do you say ? 
no . 
farty pants isn't nice , Thomas . 
you say <excuse me> [>] . 
yes [<] . 
no . 
you say excuse me please . 
can you see all that steam or smoke rising from the back of Sue's house ? 
it's steam . 
it looks like smoke . 
can you see it ? 
no . 
<it's just> [/] it's just condensation or +... [+ N] 
I don't know what to call it . 
&-um . 
hm: . 
it does look a bit messy „ doesn't it ? 
it happens every morning . 
you see . 
raining hard „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
it's coming from behind the trees . 
do you remember on bonfire night when we went for that walk ? 
and we could see all the smoke „ couldn't we ? 
from bonfires . 
rising above the trees . 
do you remember that ? 
yes . 
it's coming out of the trees . 
Sue (h)as left for work already „ hasn't she ? 
yes . 
no . 
there won't be any big bears in the trees . 
we've not been to Didsbury_Park for a long time „ have we ? 
hm: . 
it (h)as stopped now . 
look . 
I can't work out what it is , Thomas . 
perhaps (.) somebody (h)as got a tumble dryer or something that they hafta out a hose out of the window . 
it's at the back of Sue's house so we can't really see „ can we ? 
but it happens nearly every morning . 
we'll hafta ask her when we see her . 
we'll say what's going on at the back of your house , Sue . 
no needta look quite so concerned , darling . 
there's nothing wrong . 
it happens every day . 
it's not a fire . 
it's not a fire . 
there's nothing the matter . 
it (h)as stopped now though „ hasn't it ? 
darling , don't look so worried . 
please don't look worried . 
it's nothing to be frightened of . 
if it was a fire who would we needta call ? 
yes . 
who would be needta call ? 
Fireman_Sam . 
and what would he do ? 
he'd put the fires out . 
hm: . 
we'd need a fire engine with big ladders . 
that's right . 
and what would it say ? 
oh look at Molly on top of the conservatory . 
oh . 
can you see her ? 
she useta try and jump from the +... [+ N] 
oh_gosh she (h)as done it . 
that was clever . 
yes . 
<we nearly get Fireman_Sam out> [//] we nearly needta get Fireman_Sam out to get Molly down „ don't we ? 
gosh she jumped from the roof onto the fence „ didn't she ? 
it's not very far but the fence is ever so narrow from that height . 
she must have good eyesight , Thomas . 
to +/. [+ N] 
to have balanced properly . 
she landed safely „ didn't she ? 
I wondered what it was . 
I just saw something moving out of the corner of my eye . 
it was Molly . 
is there ? 
oh yes . 
yes . 
so there is . 
it's very strange . 
do you think it is ? 
do you think Thomas_The_Tank_Engine goes puffing past behind Sue's house ? 
the house next to Sue's has a sign outside again „ doesn't it ? 
it says “to let” . 
hm: . 
because the man who owns the house lives in Canada . 
that's a very long way away . 
so he +/. [+ N] 
it is . 
so he wants someone to live in the house while he's away . 
so the Estate_Agents put a sign up „ didn't they ? 
the other day . 
yes . 
on Monday morning . 
so Sue might have some new people living next door to her . 
just what I need . 
yes . 
I think she quite likes it actually when there's nobody there . 
would you like to eat this now , Thomas ? 
no thank you . 
the train wants to eat it . 
yum yum yum yum . 
there's no driver with that train now . 
I would imagine there must have been at one point because there's a little hole there that looks like a little man could have sat in it . 
I wonder if this train would go in the dish washer . 
do you think it would ? 
pardon . 
I can't tell what you're saying . 
I'm sorry about that . 
no . 
not at all . 
no . 
you don't want it to go in the dishwasher . 
well you've stood it up on it's end . 
look . 
don't bang it . 
where ? 
oh . 
I think that's Lisa with the paper „ isn't it ? 
that was a lot of banging „ wasn't it ? 
shall I go and see what it was ? 
don't bang , Thomas . 
oh Thomas , one of your friends is on the front page of the newspaper . 
look . 
The_South_Manchester_Reporter . 
and that is Jenny . 
and Carmel her Mummy . 
do you remember they keep doing things to [/] to raise some money „ don't they ? 
that's really nice . 
listen , Thomas . 
when babies are born +/. [+ N] 
and they're poorly they hafta sometimes go +... [+ N] 
can you see this picture here ? 
this clear plastic box . 
when babies are very poorly and they're newborn they hafta go in one of these . 
and then they get better . 
hm: . 
Jenny's three now but when she was a little baby she was helped by one of those little plastic boxes . 
that's your friend Jenny . 
we saw her on Friday „ didn't we ? 
you were at a music class with Jenny . 
oh that's very nice . 
that's lovely . 
actually we don't normally get this paper till Thursday „ do we ? 
and it says Thursday on the front . 
shall we see what else there is ? 
what's that ? 
it's a picture of a caravan . 
caravan and a car . 
oh . 
what an earth is that ? 
what is it ? 
it looks like a huge animal „ doesn't it ? 
but it says it's a huge rock . 
it said [?] it looks like a sculpture but it's actually just a rock . 
let's see what else we can see . 
a little girl . 
look . 
there's another caravan [?] there . 
please don't bang that , Thomas . 
it's getting on my nerves . 
is there another caravan ? 
yes . 
oh you're copying me . 
I'm licking my thumb „ aren't I ? 
before turning the page over . 
no . 
don't you do that . 
oh lots_of houses . 
a_lot of houses for sale . 
Cranky_the_crane . 
where ? 
let's have a look . 
oh yes . 
oh look , Thomas . 
they're advertising for a postoffice counter clerk . 
xxx postoffice . [+ I] 
you'd like that „ wouldn't you ? 
working in <a postbox> [//] a postoffice . 
can you imagine that all day ? 
seeing Postman_Pat coming and going and people posting letters and the box being emptied . 
and working with all those stamps [>] . 
policeman . 
I don't know who that is . 
it looks like the Lord_Mayor because he +... [+ N] 
look . 
can you see his big chain and medal round his neck ? 
and they look like policemen but I think they're xxx [>] . [+ I] 
<does he> [/] does he look like Grandad the Mayor ? 
yes . 
it's some soldiers from the Gurkka_Regiment , Thomas . 
look . 
is it ? 
which Grandad is it ? 
which Grandad ? 
Grandad Lastname or Grandad xxx . [+ I] 
what about that lady next to him ? 
could she be Nana ? 
no Nana . 
and look . 
what's he doing ? 
cutting a big cake . 
and these are soldiers . 
look . 
and they're playing bagpipes . 
can you see they've got big sashes around their fronts and across their shoulders with medals on ? 
oh it's Noddy . 
yes . 
where's that ? 
where's Noddy's fast food ? 
it doesn't say „ does it ? 
no . 
I've not see anywhere called Noddy's . 
it just says home delivery@q but it doesn't give an address . 
hm: that's funny „ isn't it ? 
seeing Noddy on the newspaper . 
it's really nice to see a picture of Jenny though „ isn't it ? 
no car . 
no . 
it's just a picture of Noddy „ isn't it ? 
and the Mayor . 
the Mayor . 
&=laughs . 
the Mayor's a very important man so he wears this big gold chain round his neck with a medal on it . 
that's not the Mayor . 
the Mayor's the man you said looked like Grandad cutting the cake . 
right . 
shall we put the newspaper away now because Daddy'll wanna read it when he gets home „ won't he ? 
and we'll be seeing Jenny and Carmel on Friday morning so we'll hafta tell them +... [+ N] 
I wonder why the paper's here today , Thomas . 
it's a day early „ isn't it ? 
did you want that ? 
no . 
no . 
the train's dirty , Thomas . 
no . 
no . 
not +... [+ N] 
don't put it in the train because the train hasn't been cleaned yet . 
what is it you're holding ? 
is it a fruit bar ? 
it's a type of biscuit you can eat at breakfast and it (h)as got fruit inside . 
what's the matter ? 
why are you looking like that ? 
what a funny face . 
&=laughs . 
what a funny face my little boy (h)as got „ hasn't he ? 
you're not going to talk to me now . 
Thomas , are you not talking ? 
why ? 
now you're not to do that . 
no . 
don't , Thomas . 
because it's dirty . 
the train is . 
it needs a good clean . 
right . 
I think we'll have a little break now because I needta go and get ready to go out . 
you want me to sit down . 
well are you going to eat that if I sit down . 
yes . 
oh well I'm going to go then . 
don't you ? 
oh if you don't want the bridge that's just the wooden trains . 
would you like your Lego train as well ? 
here . 
that's the Lego train . 
here you are . 
there's another train . 
black one . 
the black engine . 
there's the small green truck . 
it can go wherever you like , love . 
you'll hafta slot it in between one of these others „ won't you ? 
yes . 
I am because I feel a bit cold . 
it was alright when I was sitting eating but now I'm just sitting I fell a bit chilly . 
you're not chilly . 
but you're dressed . 
you've [/] you've had a bath this morning and you've got +... [+ N] 
well you'll hafta one of the other carriages in the middle . 
and after your bath you had a nice warm jumper on „ didn't you ? 
Mummy had been warming it on the radiator for you . 
so that's why you feel nice and snug . 
where are the trains going , Thomas ? 
to the airport . 
can you not reach ? 
the big train . 
oh that train . 
would you like any of the houses or shall we move those ? 
we can move them „ can we ? 
from the +/. [+ N] 
yes . 
how many trains ? 
you've got two engines . 
and you've got one two three four five carriages that slot on the back . 
you've got a big horse in the Lego train . 
and we've got two small wooden horses „ haven't we ? 
shall I put the two small horses in this truck and then you can take them for a ride ? 
we'll put one looking towards the front and one looking out towards the back . 
you want another horse . 
oh I think in the wooden train set we got +... [+ N] 
that is a horse . 
and then there's this funny [/] funny [/] funny animal . 
I'm not quite sure what that is . 
they would go in the trailer with the [/] the other horse „ wouldn't they ? 
it's big enough . 
do you think <the black> [/] the black animal is a cow ? 
is it ? 
it certainly looks more like a cow than a horse „ doesn't it ? 
I'm not sure what it is . 
very strange . 
it could be a black sheep I suppose „ couldn't it ? 
right . 
I'll just hafta stop the tape . 
do you wanna play with these trains , Thomas ? 
what else do you wanna do ? 
you wanna play at being a dustbin man . 
putting the rubbish in your lorry „ are you ? 
don't say that . 
put nappies in it . 
where's the what , darling ? 
the blue one . 
and the green one . 
oh it's over there behind the rocking chair . 
can you see it ? 
no . 
that needs to back in front of the television please . 
no . 
it needs to go back . 
it's a dirty nappie „ is it ? 
well I think it better go back , Thomas . 
you don't play with the footstool . 
no . 
no [/] no . 
in a few moments we've got to put all these cushions back and get the chairs looking [>] nice because Grandma and Grandad are coming . 
they won't have anywhere to sit „ will they ? 
if you've moved all the cushions . 
be careful . 
right . 
that's enough now , Thomas . 
I don't want you playing with that . 
no . 
no . 
no . 
it's not . 
you've got plenty of other things . 
you're not playing [>] with that one . 
don't say hey to me . 
you're not playing with it . 
no [<] . 
<you're not playing with that , Thomas> [<] . 
no . 
come on . 
don't be silly . 
you bumped your head . 
you bumped your head on my knee because you ran towards me when you were in a paddy . 
you're not very happy . 
well I'm not very happy when you do something when I tell you not to . 
give you a wipe . 
what needs wiping ? 
your nose and eyes . 
this is a clean tissue . 
don't get upset . 
I think it's because you've got a cold and you're not feeling very well . 
but listen [/] listen , Thomas . 
listen to me . 
<if you knock> [//] if you're playing with the cushions and pretending they're binbags that's fine . 
but only the cushions . 
you're not to start throwing other bits of furniture . 
because you've got four cushions and a beanbag . 
that's plenty . 
I can hear somebody talking . 
can you ? 
who do you think it is ? 
do you think it's Aunty_Linda next door ? 
we can't usually hear them talking though „ can we ? 
I wonder if we've left the radio on upstairs in our bedroom . 
no . 
go and have a look out of the window . 
do you think it's Sam's grandparents ? 
go and have a look . 
that's right . 
they come in a big caravan „ don't they ? 
or camper van I think it's called . 
that's Sam's Mummy letting herself in . 
oh look . 
there's his Grandma shuting the door . 
are you ? 
climbing up the ladder . 
are you going to watch Grandma get out of the car ? 
out of the camper van . 
no . 
she's still inside „ isn't she ? 
at the moment . 
what are you doing , Thomas ? 
you're taking all the parcels out of your green lorry . 
I thought they were dustbin bags . 
oh what are they ? 
oh are you postman now ? 
you were a dustbin man not so long ago „ weren't you ? 
you have a lot of toys . 
yes . 
are you going to put them back in the little box ? 
well until they go back you can't get anything else out „ can you ? 
you're throwing them out of the green lorry . 
what's the matter ? 
I take my slipper off . 
oh dear . 
are you going to put it back on for me ? 
the wind's blowing it off . 
I think I just took it off , Thomas . 
there we are . 
both slippers are back on now . 
is that nice ? 
no . 
don't touch that , Thomas . 
that's a good boy . 
can you see the sign that we were talking about this morning outside of Sue's neighbor's house ? 
there's Sam's Grandad now . 
is he like your Grandad ? 
he's climbing out of the caravan . 
I think it's called a camper van that . 
I called it a caravan but I don't think it is . 
inside they can sleep . 
it'll have a bed in the back so if they get tired when they're on a long journey they can have a sleep . 
I think they're driving off again now . 
or somebody is . 
yes . 
he's going backwards . 
look . 
the brake lights are on . 
can you see ? 
it looks like Grandma's sitting in the back . 
Grandad's driving . 
no Thomas . 
what do you mean no Thomas ? 
jumping the green lorry . 
have you ? 
yes . 
they've driven off . 
it's quite noisy „ isn't it ? 
you can hear it going . 
are you very busy ? 
I think it's the beanbag . 
the beanbag (h)as got lots_of polystyrene balls inside and they crackle „ don't they ? 
when it's moved . 
be careful . 
you can smell cat food . 
well there's cat food in the kitchen but I can't smell it . 
is that what you can smell ? 
no . 
don't say that . 
it's not nice . 
are you going to climb all over me now ? 
are you coming for a cuddle ? 
steady now . 
what are you doing ? 
you're hiding . 
hiding from me . 
bye bye . 
have you gone , Thomas ? 
are you going to come back ?
