you needta pull the toys out ? 
what have we got here ? 
you don't need any books ? 
what's not fair ? 
why do you want me to put it on the floor ? 
you wanna play with your train set ? 
well just before you play with your train set let's have a look at this . 
is it not fair ? 
do you remember this story about Thomas and the missing Christmas tree ? 
well do you remember what this story was all about ? 
can you remember ? 
it was Christmas time and Thomas_The_Tank_Engine was going to collect a Christmas tree „ wasn't he ? 
but what happened ? 
he got stuck in the snow „ didn't he ? 
you needta put it away now ? 
he got stuck in the snow „ didn't he ? 
the other trains and some men hadta come and rescue him . 
dig him out . 
and when he finally got the Christmas tree back to the station it was quickly decorated just before people began to crowd into the station . 
and then what happened ? 
they switched on the Christmas tree lights . 
Father_Christmas arrived . 
gave out presents to the children . 
and they had a carol party . 
and the last page of the book finishes with “all the engines had a marvelous party” . 
it's no fun getting stuck in the snow whispered Thomas . [+ R] 
but it was worth it for a party like that . [+ R] 
happy Christmas everyone . [+ R] 
look . 
Thomas has got balloons „ hasn't he ? 
he's decorated with balloons . 
well <next week> [//] next monday you're going to have a party „ aren't you ? 
and it's <going to be> [<] quite a lot of +//. [+ IN] 
we're going to hafta do some food . 
and we're going to hafta wrap some parcels up for Pass_the_Parcel . 
do you remember Pass_the_Parcel ? 
when you all sit round in a circle and music plays ? 
and when the music stops you open a layer of paper ? 
and there's usually something inside „ isn't there ? 
so we've got that to wrap . 
<and we've got to> [<] do things like Pin_The_Tail_On_The_Donkey . 
you don't wanna read any books ? 
oh that's a shame . 
because Mummy (h)as got lots_of books about birthdays . 
I thought we could work out +/. [+ IN] 
you don't wanna do that ? 
do you not remember this story ? 
this was a lovely story . 
you like this one . 
this was about a birthday party . 
we've not read these books for quite a while . 
you wanna read it now ? 
what's that ? 
a birthday cake . 
and how many candles are on that cake ? 
lots . 
there are one <two three four> [>] . 
four cakes on the candle . 
I mean +//. [+ IN] 
&=laughs . 
four candles on the cake . 
silly Mummy . 
I choose John's birthday present on my own . [+ R] 
can't I try them out , Mum ? [+ R] 
no Mum said . [+ R] 
we've bought them for John . [+ R] 
what have they bought for John's present ? 
some crayons . 
that's right . 
look . 
they're in a shop that sells all sorts of stationary . 
it (h)as got envelopes and books and pencils and pens and crayons and books and birthday cards . 
and look . 
they've obviously bought some wrapping paper because when they've got home Mummy's using the scissors to cut the wrapping paper . 
there's Sellotape on the table . 
and the little girl's holding the crayons . 
so that's what we're going to hafta do . 
we're going to cut up some wrapping paper to wrap some presents . 
and stick them with Sellotape . 
right . 
the little girl's getting ready for the party now . 
look . 
let's have your blue ribbon Mum said as she brushed her hair . [+ R] 
right . 
they've got to the party now „ haven't they ? 
can you see the balloons on the door ? 
mhm . 
shall we have some balloons on our front door next week ? 
whose party did we go to where they had balloons on the door ? 
Charlotte's . 
that's right . 
is that my present John said when we arrived . [+ R] 
happy birthday , John , Mum said . [+ R] 
she made me give him the present . [+ R] 
look . 
the little girl doesn't really wanna hand the present over to John „ does she ? 
because she bought them and she wanted to play with them . 
look . 
she doesn't look very happy „ does she ? 
John looks excited because it's his present . 
the little girl's Mummy looks excited but the little girl doesn't . 
I wonder whether we've got a name for the little girl . 
I don't think we have actually „ have we ? 
what shall we call her ? 
Lucy . 
okay . 
we'll call her Lucy . 
look . 
they're having a birthday party now . 
can you see ? 
what are they all doing ? 
they're eating crumbs ? 
what do you think they're eating ? 
food . 
they're eating food . 
what sort of food shall we have at your party next week ? 
sausages . 
and what else ? 
and bacon . 
do you want a birthday cake ? 
what sort of birthday cake do you want ? 
a blue one ? 
right . 
okay . 
&=laughs . 
you keep asking for this blue cake „ don't you ? 
well listen , darling , we've had a bit of a hiccup „ haven't we ? 
because in the past we were going to have either Bob_the_Builder or Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
and I think we decided on Thomas_The_Tank_Engine because you said you didn't want Bob_the_Builder . 
but when I went to the shop we couldn't find any Thomas things „ could we ? 
and we've ended up with the Tweenies . 
so I think what we'll try and do is buy a Tweenies cake . 
and then +/. [+ IN] 
and then +//. [+ IN] 
you wanna play with your train set now ? 
and then I think we'll perhaps have (.) on Sunday next week Grandma and Granddad are coming . 
because it's mother's day on Sunday . 
so you've got to make a fuss of Mummy . 
and Daddy (h)as got to make a fuss of Grandma . 
so I think what we might do is have a em Thomas_The_Tank_Engine cake . 
then for Mother's day and your birthday <with Grandma and Granddad> [>] . 
here's my cake John shouted . [+ R] 
he just left my present on the floor . [+ R] 
look . 
he (h)as been so excited by everything he (h)as got he (h)as thrown the wrapping paper on the floor . 
after tea we had games and balloons . [+ R] 
and running about and jumping and +... [+ IN] 
+, clomping [?] . 
look . 
they're having a great time „ aren't they ? 
with balloons . 
oh it's time to go home now . 
my dad collected me . [+ R] 
give her the balloon John's Mum said . [+ R] 
do you really want it John said . [+ R] 
yes please I said . [+ R] 
I do . [+ R] 
now you see when they arrived the little girl didn't wanna hand the present over to John „ did she ? 
and now they're leaving John doesn't wanna give the little girl a balloon to take home . 
and she really wants it . 
so this time the little girl's looking happy and the little boy's looking sad . 
that was a nice story „ wasn't it ? 
oh ! 
you don't want that ? 
you want that away ? 
what's that ? 
the wheels on the bus ? 
you don't like that ? 
oh dear . 
you're still not well „ are you ? 
this is called teddy's birthday surprise . 
on the morning of teddy's birthday the postman brought him a special letter . [+ R] 
teddy opened it quickly . [+ R] 
it was an invitation to a surprise party in his honour . [+ R] 
do you think we'll be seeing a lot of the postman next week ? 
oh it isn't actually next week . 
it's the week after „ isn't it ? 
it's a week on Monday . 
I think we will .

and ran through the woods where he found a big red bus parked decked with balloons . [+ R] 
all of teddy's friends were inside the bus having a wonderful time . [+ R]

and two carriages ? 
inside his house teddy found a beautiful train set . [+ R] 
teddy loved trains and wished he could be an engine driver one day . [+ R] 
the next day teddy's father took him to a real railway station . [+ R] 
and teddy met an engine driver . [+ R] 
you can wave the train off with my flag said the engine driver . [+ R] 
teddy stood on the platform and waved the flag as the train pulled away . [+ R] 
teddy was too small to drive a real train . [+ R] 
but you can drive the baggage cart said the driver . [+ R] 
teddy was delighted as he drove the baggage cart down the platform . [+ R]

and those are the cups we'll drink out of . 
who have they got on them ?

and then we've got to write one to Thomas &-uh well they hafta write one to Thomas . 
thank you for you invitation I will (.) will not be able to come . 
and there we hafta write our address „ don't we ? 
and telephone number .

and look . 
we've [/] we've got this as well . 
oh are we being a train now ? 
we've got a table cover with the Tweenies on . 
oh , Thomas , don't make such a lot of noise . 
do you want me to help you build a train track round the sofa ? 
pardon ? 
would you like Mummy and Daddy to buy you a few more pieces for your train set , Thomas , for your birthday ? 
all the way round the block ? 
well I wondered about trying to find you an engine shed . 
so that all your engines had somewhere to sleep . 
what do you think ? 
what's on the engine line ? 
a tree ? 
well this is a good shape „ isn't it ? 
I think we can manage to get +/. [+ IN] 
all the way round the block ? 
is that what you're saying ? 
all the way round the block ? 
oh [<] dear . 
it (h)as fallen off the table at that end . 
oh_gosh . 
I think the train track pressed against the police car and started the engine off „ didn't it ? 
we could put some bits of fence there look . 
and it'll stop the trains falling off the end . 
pardon ? 
another piece of wood over there ? 
right . 
well we'll put that there as well . 
oh ! 
there we are . 
we'll just move the police car because every time we move the train track it presses on the button . 
right . 
shall we set up some houses and things over here ? 
the train's putting his poop poop on ? 
his siren ? 
poop poop . 
oh I see . 
I'm the fireman on the train „ am I ? 
stoking up the fire to make some smoke . 
some warm steam ? 
that's clever . 
is it ? 
the table isn't really big enough „ is it ? 
we could really do this better on the floor . 
right . 
what [//] where do you wanna put your signs , Thomas ? 
one next there . 
one next to that . 
that is a good idea . 
yeah . 
shall we put some houses there ? 
near the church ? 
that can be a village there . 
the village there with lots_of houses . 
and over here (.) look (.) it's the shops and the school . 
does that look nice ? 
I'd quite to live in that village . 
somebody (h)as bashed the train ? 
you've dropped one ? 
who's a good person ? 
because I picked it up ? 
you said “you're a good person „ aren't you” ? 
&=laughs . 
I'm not a lady I'm a person ? 
&=laughs . 
no . 
I'm not a traffic sign . 
I'm a person . 
you're saying a lot of “stop and go” this morning „ aren't you ? 
and up and down . 
stop and go . 
and up and down . 
what about over and under ? 
do you know what over and under is ? 
over is this . 
when it goes over the bridge on top . 
and under is when it goes below the bridge . 
under the bridge . 
it is a good idea „ isn't it ? 
you calling me Milo now ? 
yes I know , Milo . 
where's the train going , Thomas ? 
Mummy's . 
it's going to stop at the village school ? 
it's going to stop at Manchester village ? 
right . 
Manchester's a city actually , Thomas . 
the city or the town is where they have shops . 
and a village is usually where they have houses and <perhaps a school> [>] . 
a chip shop ? 
well they could have a chip shop in the village or a town „ couldn't they ? 
villages are smaller than towns . 
and villages are mainly in country areas and there are fields and parks and trees . 
and churches and pubs and post offices and schools . 
leaves drop down ? 
yes . 
well leaves drop down in the city and the town as well as the village and the country „ don't they ? 
in autumn when the leaves are falling off the trees they fall off trees wherever they are . 
look . 
at this scene here <we've got> [/] we've got the shops and the school . 
and there're trees here . 
and over there where the houses are there are trees . 
but you can have houses in places that aren't villages . 
they can still be towns . 
in streets . 
I mean we don't live in a village „ do we ? 
no . 
we just live on a +//. [+ IN] 
well it's +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
Grandma and Granddad_Bealby useta live in a village . 
in a country village near York . 
they've moved to a town now . 
but when +/. [+ IN] 
oh that's right . 
we were watching Auntie_Mabel and Pippin and they were moving house . 
poor Pippin didn't wanna move house „ did he ? 
or did she ? 
I think Pippin's a girl . 
she wanted to stay where she was in the old house „ didn't she ? 
Auntie_Mabel doesn't look like she lives in a village because the [/] the bungalow that it shows is in +//. [+ IN] 
she looks very much as if she lives in the country on her own . 
I can't think of any other houses near Auntie_Mabel . 
but we live +//. [+ IN] 
our address is Streetname Drive . 
this is called the drive . 
or sometimes it's called a close . 
or a road . 
or a street . 
or a cul-de-sac . 
hasn't it ? 
where are the carriages for the train ? 
oh right . 
<why is it> [//] why's the little engine going of on it's own ? 
he's waiting [>] +... [+ IN] 
he's waiting and waiting . 
why is he waiting ? 
pardon ? 
I can't tell what you're saying , love . 
that's a long train that „ isn't it ? 
you wish you had a train set ? 
well (.) I can share yours „ can't I , Thomas ? 
I haven't got a train set of my own but I play with yours quite a bit . 
and Daddy plays with it a lot „ doesn't he ? 
I think Daddy really enjoys your train set . 
pardon ? 
you cry that he won't give it back to you ? 
course he'll give it back to you . 
it's your train set „ isn't it ? 
the carriage is going near the little mark on the tablecloth ? 
do you know what the little mark is , Thomas ? 
it's a pen mark . 
because I think somebody (h)as been drawing with a pen . 
somebody called . 
Thomas (.) Henry (.) Lastname has been drawing with a pen and missing the paper . 
is it Daddy ? 
I shall tell him off when I see him . 
I'll say naughty Daddy for drawing on my tablecloth . 
you're not naughty . 
no . 
as if . 
so what would Thomas like for his birthday ? 
balloons ? 
balloons on your jumper ? 
okay . 
you might get some little badges that say I am three . 
you can wear those on your jumper „ can't you ? 
we've got to work out who we're +//. [+ IN] 
oh , Thomas , have you got a splinter in your finger ? 
just let me have a look please , darling . 
please let me look . 
because it'll hurt . 
did it come from the wooden track ? 
the wooden train track ? 
oh please let me have a look , darling . 
because if we don't get it out it'll hurt . 
I can get it out in a second . 
get a pair of scissors ? 
no . 
I don't need a pair of scissors . 
<I just needta> [/] I just needta do that . 
better ? 
is that better ? 
let me give it a kiss . 
oh give you a kiss as well . 
oh , darling . 
you've been a poorly boy this week „ haven't you ? 
feeling a bit better today ? 
good . 
so you want some balloons ? 
what are you looking at ? 
what have you done ? 
<do you> [<] [/] do you want your potty ? 
you sure ? 
you'll tell Mummy „ won't you ? 
I know what it is . 
you've just discovered <you're not> [/] you're sitting in your chair that you sit in for meals . 
but you haven't got straps on „ have you ? 
oh you have ! 
you've done it yourself ! 
did you put the strap on yourself ? 
aren't you clever ? 
so we're going to have some balloons and you might have a badge . 
Thomas_The_Tank in Macdonalds ? 
oh . 
you're a good christian ? 
well those are the traffic signs . 
well there aren't any more , darling . 
there are three there . 
Thomas , why did you say you're a good christian ? 
you said this before . 
what do you mean ? 
you've got loads of traffic signs ? 
well where are they ? 
oh there's one . 
look . 
you had four . 
there we are . 
how's that ? 
you've got lots . 
two yellows and two reds . 
that's right . 
<this one> [//] this red one says do not enter . 
that yellow one shows there's a level crossing so pedestrians can cross . 
I'm really not sure what that means . 
but it's a yellow sign „ isn't it ? 
it means what ? 
Peter_Pointer not train on the sledge ? 
what on earth does that mean ? 
and that one says stop . 
yes . 
you're quite right . 
that one says stop . 
stop means stop . 
you can't go . 
it's like Julian at music lesson . 
he says go when he wants you to bang the instruments . 
when he wants you to run round or dance . 
but he says stop when he wants you to be still and quiet „ doesn't he ? 
we like music lessons „ don't we ? 
sang the scarecrow song „ didn't you „ this week ?

it sounds loud and low „ doesn't it ? 
where are the traffic signs , Thomas ? 
oh ! 
and which one is that ? 
what does that say ? 
that says do not enter . 
and what does that say ? 
that's the one we don't know what it means . 
we'll hafta find out . 
we'll hafta ask somebody what that sign means . 
it means the train not go under the tunnel thing ? 
hm: . 
where've the traffic signs gone , Thomas ? 
they've gone to bed ? 
under the bed ? 
you've put them under the arches of the bridges so they've gone to bed ? 
ah they having a sleep ? 
gosh . 
they'll soon wake up when the train goes over the bridge because it'll make an awful noise „ won't it ? 
oh yes .

you need some sweets ? 
you feeling up to sweets ? 
you've not really been eating much . 
although you've eaten a bit more today „ haven't you ? 
you had a ride on Bob_the_Builder in John_Lewis ? 
I think it was in Sainsbury actually though . 
Tesco .

you can't cut the piece of wood . 
it's the train track ! 
you silly_billy@wp .

I tell you what . 
we needta make a list of who we've got to invite , Thomas . 
<we could> [>] +... [+ IN] 
we could do with <a fire> [//] <&-uh a &pa> [//] a house as big as Fireman_Sam's fire station .

there you are . 
just on that side please . 
Mummy (h)as written on the other side . 
just keep it on the paper . 
not on the cloth . 
so it's just your close friends on your birthday . 
but then during the week we can invite other people because we're going to ask Abigail to come „ aren't we ? 
Abigail can come with Molly and Francis . 
because Abigail and Molly and Francis don't really know anybody else . 
and their two Mummy's would like to see each other . 
so I think we'll have a little tea party one afternoon . 
and then we've got to invite Lauren and Caitlin and Jenny . 
<at a separate time> [>] . 
does he ? 
well Fireman_Sam can come along . 
he won't take up much room . 
because Lauren (.) Caitlin and Jenny all go to nursery in the afternoon . 
they wouldn't be able to come on Monday . 
but they could perhaps come another day . 
one morning for some cakes or something . 
or some sausage rolls . 
yes . 
and then we've got Rachael (.) Lauren and Becky . 
they've got to come another time . 
&-uh not Lauren (.) Rachael and Laura and Becky . 
they could come one [/] one day „ couldn't they ?

that's a bit dangerous really , Thomas .

can he not drive <on the &dr> [//] on the road ? 
there might be people walking on the pavement . 
you and I might be going to the shop to buy some fruit . 
and if a fire engine suddenly comes along the pavement we'll get knocked down . 
oh goodness ! 
that would be a to do „ wouldn't it ? 
he's on the pavement „ is he ? 
oh look . 
there's a horse galloping on the pavement .

and another horse ! 
and a sheep .

well it was this morning but I don't think the telly was on this morning . 
<it was on the video> [<] . 
where's the pencil ? 
it's here . 
do you remember that man ? 
in his garden ? 
it was spring and he was having to rake all the grass to take out all the dead grass and all the <things that had blown over the winter> [>] . 
Uncle_Jake ? 
is that what the man was called ? 
oh right . 
and he said he was surprised the grass grew because of what had happened earlier in the year . 
and he was showing us in the summer children were playing on his grass and he was having a lovely time „ wasn't he ? 
but then it got so hot . 
and there was a shortage of water and he couldn't use his water sprinkler . 
and there was no rain on the grass . 
and the grass dried up „ didn't it ? 
and then what happened ? 
do you remember what got onto his garden and started eating the grass ? 
some sheep got onto his grass „ didn't they ? 
and started munching all the grass . 
and then it was autumn and all the leaves blew down and he hadta use his rake again to sweep up all the leaves . 
and he put his lawn mower away „ didn't he ? 
in the autumn . 
because the grass wasn't growing . 
it was colder . 
and then what happened in winter ? 
one morning he got up . 
he was having his breakfast and he opened the curtains and what did he find on his grass ? 
no . 
apart from sheep . 
what's white in winter ? 
snow . 
it was absolutely covered in snow . 
and the snow melted (.) the weather got warmer and it was spring . 
and the grass has grown just like our grass is growing . 
oh don't draw with your pen on your train set , Thomas . 
no . 
please may I have that now ? 
I needta do some <some writing> [>] .

looks like that . 
it's more like a slug ? 
well it's only a little snake .

looks more like a slug „ does it ? 
yes . 
I've seen you drawing on the cloth .

you've just drawn on my cloth and you've moved the paper so I wouldn't see . 
oh ! 
Thomas_Henry .

oh I see . 
that's my card . 
and that's the wiggly snake that you've drawn on it . 
oh it actually says on the back it says snake . 
shall I put it round my neck ? 
like that ? 
have you seen anywhere [//] anybody on television with a snake round their neck ? 
haven't you ? 
you've seen a yellow one biting my tummy ? 
oh look . 
look who's going along the train track . 
it's snake . 
hiss@o . 
that's what snakes say . 
they hiss .

under the bridge .

<ow ow> [/] ow . 
ah naughty snake .

ah . 
what are we going to call your snake ? 
Fred . 
oh I can hear Alice barking . 
I don't know . 
perhaps somebody (h)as gone to their house . 
do you think somebody's visitting ? 
who do you think it might be ? 
Auntie_Mabel moving ? 
oh you think Auntie Mabel she (h)as left the bungalow with Pippin and they're moving next door to live with Linda and Brian „ are they ? 
do you think so ? 
that would be nice if we had Auntie_Mabel and Pippin next door „ wouldn't it ? 
could I have a kiss now please ? 
ah poor Mummy . 
you need your snake back ? 
<what do you say> [<] ? 
there you are . 
are you going to draw something else ? 
what are you going to draw this time ? 
oh look who's on the fence . 
hello , Felix . 
Felix wants to join in your house ? 
he wants to come in the house „ does he ? 
I bet he does actually . 
because he likes coming in here „ doesn't he ? 
do you know why he likes coming in here ? 
because he eats +... [+ IN] 
Purdie's [<] food „ doesn't he ? 
hello , Felix . 
what are you asking Felix ? 
if he wants to join in ? 
oh I hope he doesn't eat the tree . 
did you ask him if he wanted to join in ? 
did you say “hello do you wanna join in” ? 
I think it's going to rain . 
you think it's not ? 
it was nice when we walked to bang^a^drum^time@c but it's going to rain this afternoon . 
I can tell . 
it is going dark . 
yes . 
yes . 
look at the sky . 
and the wind (h)as got up . 
because I can't get over how quickly the windmill's blowing . 
I'm really glad Daddy moved that windmill over there . 
this big flower windmill here . 
the different colors . 
what colors can we see ? 
it's hard to [/] to see when it's going round . 
what +//. [+ IN] 
oh I was just about to say white and orange and it (h)as spun so quickly you can't see the colors „ can you ? 
this big flower up here (.) no matter how quickly it goes you can always tell the color because it's just one color . 
it's just pink . 
but that multicolored one when it's spinning quickly you can't tell the colors . 
look at that . 
wow . 
it is „ isn't it ? 
is it ? 
I tell you what actually , Thomas . 
if Nana and Granddad are going to Fleetwood or Cleveleys I might ask them to get those windmills . 
because they would be nice to put in the party bag „ wouldn't they ? 
because we wanted something +//. [+ IN] 
you often get little knicknacks in party bags and we've got so many different people coming (.) different ages . 
but a windmill (.) one of those little windmills +//. [+ IN] 
they weren't very expensive . 
that would be a superb present „ wouldn't it ? 
if we put in the party bag +//. [+ IN] 
<we've got something> [//] we're going to give everybody a balloon with a Tweenie on it . 
and a chocolate bar with a Tweenie character . 
and if we put some blow bubbles and a piece of cake . 
then they've got bubbles (.) a balloon (.) chocolate bar (.) piece of cake and instead of putting a little toy in which we don't know what to put we could put in one of those windmills . 
what do you think to that ? 
big lolly ? 
is that a nice idea ? 
the only thing is with those windmills the might be a little bit too large to put in a party bag . 
I don't know . 
I don't think they are . 
but you've had such a lot of fun out of them „ haven't you ? 
and windmill [//] the [/] the Tweenies have the Tweenie clock „ don't they ? 
Tweenie clock +... [+ IN] 
+, where will it stop . 
they're not really like the Tweenie clocks „ are they ? 
those windmills . 
but (.) it does spin round . 
your feet feel cold . 
where are your slippers ? 
where (h)as your slipper gone ? 
you don't know ? 
oh no don't take that off . 
you've got some new slippers as well „ haven't you ? 
we haven't tried [//] well we have tried them on . 
we haven't started wearing them properly . 
they've got Thomas_The_Tank_Engine on them . 
look . 
the windmill (h)as stopped now . 
we can look at the colors . 
white (.) orange (.) blue (.) purple (.) red (.) green and a yellow centre . 
are those all the colors of the rainbow ? 
no . 
it isn't because there'd be pink . 
red and yellow and pink and green . [+ R] 
orange and purple and blue . [+ R] 
well the windmill (h)as got a white bit . 
and in a rainbow it would be pink . 
let me just have a look . 
perhaps it was pink and it (h)as faded a bit . 
because it does look a little bit pink „ doesn't it ? 
I think it is all the colors of the rainbow . 
and the leaves are a darker green „ aren't they ? 
how many colors in the rainbow , Thomas ? 
<no because> [//] well no it looks like it's going to rain but there's no sunshine . 
it (h)as clouded over „ hasn't it ? 
there (h)as got to be sun and rain together to form a rainbow . 
there are seven colors in the rainbow . 
red (.) yellow (.) pink (.) blue (.) orange (.) purple and +... [+ IN] 
+, green . 
what's your favorite color ? 
blue . 
I like blue . 
I wear a lot of blue . 
Nana likes what ? 
der^der^der@c ? 
what's der^der^der@c ? 
you want me to sit on the chair ? 
well I was just going to see what time it was actually , Thomas . 
I'll be back in a second , darling . 
<is it> [<] six o'clock now ? 
it's six o'clock so you needta watch Bob_the_Builder ? 
well I hope it's not six o'clock , Thomas . 
because we sat down just after lunch . 
if it's six o'clock we've been sitting down for four or five hours . 
do you ? 
okay . 
I don't think Bob_the_Builder's on but there's this video that Daddy bought at Christmas . 
it's quite funny „ isn't it ? 
because we lost this and then when I was cleaning your room we found it underneath your bed . 
Bob_the_Builder (.) Bob's white Christmas and other storys . 
you wanna put it in the machine ? 
in the video ? 
Bob's white Christmas and other storys . 
in Bob's white Christmas Bob decorates the yard with lights and a Christmas tree . [+ R] 
and even helps Santa_Claus <by dressing up as him for the school concert> [>] . [+ R] 
when you put it in the machine you could see a big Christmas tree „ could you ? 
suddenly it starts to snow heavily and farmer Pickles gets snowed in while Dizzy gets stuck in a snow drift . [+ R] 
can Bob rescue them both and still make it back in time for the school concert ? [+ R] 
gosh this is funny . 
because although it's March we were talking earlier on about +/. [+ IN] 
Bob_the_Builder's wearing a Santa outfit „ isn't he ? 
and is this Scoop the digger ? 
because he (h)as got all sorts of parcels . 
he's being used as Santa's sleigh . 
Bob_the_Builder's sleigh . 
now I was just saying , Thomas , we started off by talking about the em Thomas_The_Tank_Engine story where &-uh Thomas was trying to get a tree ready for the Christmas party . 
do you remember ? 
and he got stuck in the snow . 
and he got back in time and they decorated the <&ca> [//] Christmas tree and had a <carol concert> [>] ? 
let's open it ? 
and now we're going to watch a video about +/. [+ IN] 
Bob_the_Builder at Christmas . 
oh look . 
<what's inside> [>] ? 
let's have a look . 
oh look . 
there's even one called Bob's birthday . 
I think there was em Thomas_The_Tank_Engine book about birthdays as well „ wasn't there ? 
what can you see on there ? 
let's put it on . 
you wanna put the video on „ do you ? 
okay [/] okay . 
right . 
you needta sit down there ? 
not on my knee just on the chair ? 
that's okay . 
pardon ? 
what about the chair ? 
a wishing chair ? 
who (h)as got a wishing chair ? 
Dia +... [+ IN] 
Dia [//] Diadora has a wishing chair ? 
who's Diadora , Thomas ? 
oh <no no> [/] no . 
I know what you're thinking about . 
you're thinking about the episode of Auntie_Mabel and Pippin where they went to stay with Dora . 
Auntie_Mabel's friend . 
and when they were coming home Pippin forgot her suitcase . 
then Auntie_Mabel hadta write a letter thanking Dora for a nice time and saying but Pippin has forgotten her suitcase . 
so she started a letter by saying Dear Dora . 
that's right . 
that's right . 
Auntie_Mabel wrote the letter Dear Dora . 
then she put it in an envelope (.) sealed the envelope (.) wrote the address on the envelope and stuck a stamp on it . 
then her and Pippin went to the postbox and posted it in the postbox . 
and then what happened ? 
the postman came +/. [+ IN] 
he took the letter that Auntie_Mabel had written . 
he took it out of the postbox and put it in the sack in his van . 
and then he drove off . 
and then it went to the sorting office „ didn't it ? 
we watched it go through that machine very quickly . 
and then it went back into a different postman's sack and that postman delivered it too Dora . 
but I don't <quite know> [//] quite understand +//. [+ IN] 
oh dear [/] dear . 
I've just taken a tape out of the machine (.) and look at it . 
it's all chewed up . 
that's Daddy's tape . 
you've not been touching it have you , Tom ? 
promise me ? 
because Daddy will be ever so cross if you have . 
you've just pressed a button ? 
when did you press the button ? 
you don't know ? 
I'd keep quiet about pressing buttons if I were you . 
we needta rewind this „ don't we ? 
I think you watched this em (.) video the other day with Daddy „ didn't you ? 
it's the end of the tape we needta rewind it . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
I'm sure Daddy will be able to mend it . 
I don't think you've actually had the video out of the machine though „ have you ? 
we'll let Daddy sort that out when he comes home . 
but it's very [/] very important , Thomas , that you never ever press any buttons . 
because if you do this is what happens . 
look . 
the tape comes out of the cassette . 
and it means that you'll never ever be able to watch anything on tape if the machine breaks or the tapes break . 
come here , sweetheart . 
your eyes look heavy . 
are you a tired boy again ? 
you're <really really> [/] really tired . 
shall I let you into a secret ? 
oh . 
because I was just going to tell you I feel <really really> [/] really tired . 
<I feel> [/] I feel cold as well . 
do you feel cold ? 
you feel frosty ? 
you're a wiggily wobble [/] wobble ? 
what's a wiggily wobble [/] wobble ? 
oh , Thomas . 
you silly_billy@wp . 
we've just bumped our heads . 
that was a stupid thing to do „ wasn't it ? 
it was a silly thing to do . 
no . 
that's an even sillier thing to do (.) press buttons . 
look . 
who's this ? 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine ? 
did Daddy do that picture for you ? 
there's all sorts of different things . 
don't turn the television on now . 
all sorts of things on there . 
look . 
look . 
there's Terence_the_Tractor . 
and Cranky_the_Crane . 
and Bull_Strode . 
I don't know who Bull_Strode is . 
it's obviously a boat or a ship but I've not heard of him before . 
and troublesome trucks . 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
you needta put that <on the floor> [>] . 
that's Daddy's . 
yes . 
don't touch that . 
that's Daddy's . 
that's Daddy's instruction booklet „ isn't it ? 
for the video . 
Thomas , no [/] no . 
now you wait . 
what have I just said about pressing buttons ? 
if you keep pressing buttons Mummy and Daddy are not going to let you watch videos on television . 
do you understand that ? 
do you understand ? 
well you (h)ad better understand pretty quickly . 
right . 
let's see if Bob_the_Builder's coming „ shall we ? 
that the remote control ? 
a car wash ? 
oh I don't think that's the video . 
that's a different &-uh channel „ isn't it ? 
that's it . 
it's number nine for the video „ isn't it ? 
no . 
but it'll come on in a moment , darling . 
it's just the start of the video .
