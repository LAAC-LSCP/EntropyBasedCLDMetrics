and when people get old (.) lots_of changes happen . 
you know how you're growing from a baby into a little boy „ aren't you ?

+, taller [<] . 
do you ? 
oh right . 
well why would you like to reach that ceiling ? 
the camera ? 
oh that's a microphone . 
so you don't keep growing up . 
or growing taller but lots_of changes keep happening . 
and one of those changes that happens is that the color goes from you hair quite often . 
dark hair like Daddy . 
go grey when they get older . 
what color hair has Grandma_Bealby got ? 
white . 
and what color hair has Granddad_Beably got ?

what's the matter ? 
you're very tearful .

if you're a good boy . 
well you like bacon +/. [+ IN] 
oh he's just doing some work in his garden . 
and his head keeps bobbing up „ doesn't it ? 
what sort of sweetie would you like ? 
why don't you have the gingerbread man that Nana and Granddad bought you ? 
but , Thomas , it isn't a very good lunch „ is it ? 
just a bowl of plain pasta . 
and [<] sweeties . 
well I think you've got to eat a little bit more food first . 
do you know what Uncle_Brian's doing outside ? 
you know all that very tall grass at the window ? 
well he's digging it up for me . 
because I can't see the roses . 
we've got a beautiful hydrangea in the corner which we can't see . 
and all the roses +/. [+ IN] 
are getting choked with the xxx grass . [+ PI] 
and Uncle_Brain wants some of the grass for his garden . 
so he (h)as come to dig some up . 
and then he's going to plant it in a different part of the garden where there isn't something growing . 
Thomas , don't keep asking for sweeties . 
would you like a yoghurt ? 
well you can have a sweetie (.) but that's your pudding .

then you'll have your teeth brushed after lunch . 
what about a jam tart ? 
well a sweetie is not going to fill you up „ is it , Thomas ? 
it isn't . 
we've got this new bowl „ haven't we ? 
for [<] sweeties . 
a special sweetie bowl for a special boy .

well you did have quite a large breakfast „ didn't you ? 
and you've eaten all your pasta . 
but at teatime you've got to eat a proper meal .

not really . 
no . 
I don't like it when you ask for sweets all the time . 
mind you (.) you don't always get them „ do you ? 
in fact you ask far more then you get them . 
I can hear some people talking outside . 
I don't know who that is because it's not Uncle_Brian . 
it's some people talking at the back . 
yes . 
I don't think we can see them because they're tall trees . 
it sounds like where (.) the talking is coming from . 
I tell you what you'd like to eat , Thomas . 
that you could have sometime instead of sweet . 
do you remember little sultanas ? 
and raisin ? 
you useta eat a lot of those . 
in a little bowl .

it's not nice „ is it ? 
and we'll throw that ball away . 
and we'll wash those brushes . 
these (.) Purdie's brushes . 
we hafta keep brushing Purdie's fur „ don't we ? 
because she (h)as got very long fur . 
and can you see this ? 
Mummy's keeping this collar because this was the first collar that Purdie ever wore . 
and can you see how she chewed it because she didn't like something round her neck . 
well I think it useta irritate her . 
look and there's two glittery collars there . 
<a pink> [//] a red one and +... [+ IN] 
+, a [>] green one . 
0 [= laughs] . 
what did you say ? 
hold that for me , darling ? 
and pull ? 
was there ? 
a spider coming out of that little crack in the (..) skirting board ? 
is that what you mean ? 
yes . 
there's another cotton reel there . 
because (.) when it was new it had cotton all round it . 
have you seen Mummy when she's sewing a button on ? 
well the cotton (h)as gone now „ hasn't it ? 
you know there's cotton wrapped all the way round this cotton reel . 
and then when the cotton (h)as run out Mummy saves the cotton reels (.) put a bit of string through and I useta tie it to the bottom of the chair . 
well I don't think you can really play with them , Thomas , because those are +/. [+ IN] 
+, important letters „ <aren't they> [>] ? 
no . 
do you ? 
what I think we might do is <we've got some> [//] we've got pussy cats down here „ haven't we ? 
let's have a look at the pussy cats again . 
I'm going to get a bag to put all those collars in . 
well I don't think you better play with those because , Thomas , they've things like +//. [+ IN] 
you know when we take Purdie to the vet's for her injections ? 
those are certificates to say that she (h)as had her injections . 
and if we start messing about with them we might lose them . 
and then (..) when we try and take Purdie to the cattery and they say (.) can you prove she (h)as had her injections we won't be able to „ will we ? 
<I tell> [<] you what . 
pretend that's your mail sack . 
and I want you to put the letters into that bag very [>] [/] very carefully . 
please . 
there you are put them in (..) like that . 
so I'll do those and then you can (..) put the others in „ can't you ? 
right . 
that's it . 
you put those in . 
how's that ? 
and those needta go in as well . 
and then we'll get a different bag in a minute and we'll put the collars away . 
for next week ? 
xxx [<] collar „ isn't it ? [+ PI] 
well at the moment Purdie's not wearing a collar because +//. [+ IN] 
do you remember when she was poorly a few weeks ago ? 
she went to the vet's . 
and the vet hadta do a blood test „ didn't he ? 
and to do that he hadta shave some fur away from her neck . 
do you remember him doing that ? 
and so actually she (h)as got a little bald patch on her neck now . 
her neck's a bit sore . 
well no . 
it's not really [/] really sore but until her fur grows back she's scratching her neck quite a lot because it's tickling her . 
and so I don't think we should put a collar on her until she's properly better „ do you ? 
gosh we've got a lot of combs for Purdie . 
are you managing ? 
and I'm just washing the combs and giving her little balls a wipe . 
and then I shall wash the storage box out . 
yes . 
that's right . 
pop it in the bag please , darling . 
and then we'll get all the papers together . 
we've got information from the vet's and details of when she (h)as had injections . 
and we've got forms about her insurance . 
and there's some photographs there of Purdie . 
and a little book that we've written things in . 
are you doing a good job there ? 
you want me to post one ? 
right . 
which one would you like me to post ? 
this green one . 
right . 
okay . 
now be careful with those papers , Thomas , because they're quite important . 
okay ? 
right ? 
how's that ? 
that's okay ? 
right . 
now I'll put these little ping pong balls there to dry . 
before putting them back in the box . 
do you know what Purdie did one Christmas , Thomas ? 
can you see this little Christmas tree bauble here ? 
can you see it's covered with some thread ? 
and can you see this little grey plastic ball with a hole in it ? 
well shall I tell you what happened ? 
one day +/. [+ IN] 
it was as Sunday morning and Mummy had some friends staying . 
and it was before we lived in this house . 
we lived in a flat . 
it was before I knew Daddy . 
and Mummy's friends were staying in Mummy's bedroom and Mummy was sleeping on the mattress on the floor in the lounge . 
and it was just before Christmas and I had a huge Christmas tree in the corner of the room . 
and it was decorated with baubles like this . 
and +/. [+ IN] 
well it had +//. [+ IN] 
I don't know what it had on the top . 
I can't remember . 
<I don't> [//] it probably had some different sweets wrapped up . 
you know how we've had little things wrapped up in silver paper „ didn't we ? 
at Christmas . 
and Purdie ran right to the top of the tree . 
and before I knew it had happened the whole tree started to fall down toward where Mummy was sleeping . 
and it crashed on the floor . 
all the baubles fell off . 
did you ? 
that's right . 
yes . 
that's what you would have done if you (h)ad been around at the time (.) I'm sure . 
and do you know we found pine needles for weeks and weeks from that Christmas tree . 
but +/. [+ IN] 
+, once the baubles were on the floor Purdie then +//. [+ IN] 
she wasn't a bit bothered that she (h)ad caused all this chaos +/. [+ IN] 
+, then she ran round and round and round the room with the Christmas tree baubles using them like footballs . 
she was kicking them and playing . 
do you remember we saw her on Sunday run round the garden ? 
she was running really fast „ wasn't she ? 
playing . 
well [<] that's what she was doing this day with the Christmas tree baubles . 
is it windy now ? 
and we were busy cleaning up all this mess and we suddenly wondered what +//. [+ IN] 
wrapped round all the chairs was a very [/] very fine red sort of cotton wool thing . 
<it was> [/] it was a cross between a piece of cotton and wool . 
it was all thread and wound round . 
and do you know what had happened ? 
do you see this pink Christmas tree bauble ? 
it was a red one . 
all that fine twine had got unraveled and she (h)as wrapped it round and round and round the chairs . 
and that's what we were left with . 
this little grey ball . 
so I think she had a lot of fun , Purdie , doing that . 
look there's a picture of Purdie here . 
this is at Grandma's house . 
your sack's full ? 
well shall we shake +//. [+ IN] 
would you like Mummy to help ?

let's get one of these nice strong bags . 
that's a bit bag actually „ isn't it ? 
now would you like to put all Purdie's collars +... [+ IN] 
do you think that bag's big enough ? 
no (.) we do need a bigger bag „ don't we ? 
<the bigger> [<] bag's better . 
we'll use that for something else . 
and you can put that little disc in as well . 
let me just open the sack . 
right now what are you going to pretend the collars are ? 
you could be posting +//. [+ IN] 
what do you think they look like ? 
they look like blue ? 
well it's a blue collar . 
do they look like wiggly worms ? 
we won't put the lead in we'll put that +/. [+ IN] 
we'll put the lead somewhere <else I think> [>] . 
are they ? 
yes . 
that's a nice glittery red one „ isn't it ? 
because we've had Purdie a long [/] long time , haven't we ? 
and some of the collars +//. [+ IN] 
when we've used flea bands which we don't tend to use now +//. [+ IN] 
we've thrown those away when she (h)as finished wearing them . 
but some of these nice ones (.) are very expensive collars and they were bought as presents . 
and we always useta get Purdie a nice shiny collar at Christmas . 
yes . 
she useta get two collars a year .
