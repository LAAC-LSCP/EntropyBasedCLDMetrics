and they weren't the dandelions with the yellow leafs „ were they ? 
they were the white . 
<dandelion clocks> [>] . 
what did we do ? 
we blew them and the petals came off . 
you show Mummy what you did with the dandelions . 
that's right . 
I'm making a little hole in the stalk and let's put the daisy . 
right [<] . 
yellow . 
look . 
that's called a daisy chain , Thomas . 
when you string a lot of daisys together it's called a daisy chain . 
are you going to put that in Dobbin's hair as well ? 
Dobbin got flowers in his hair . 
oh that's lovely „ isn't it ? 
more ? 
we haven't got any more . 
we haven't got any more . 
shall Mummy go and get some more ? 
well if we get some more let's fill an egg+cup with some water [>] and put the daisys in there . 
because otherwise they'll die „ won't they ? 
if they're left out of the water ? 
no we aren't going to get any more . 
let's just get an egg+cup of water and put the daisys and the buttercup that we've picked . 
oh . 
not in the washing+up now Thomas . 
no . 
I know it's water but that's water but that's not quite what Mummy had in mind . 
oh now [?] here's an egg+cup . 
let's fill it with water . 
right . 
we go back through here . 
yes . 
what's this ? 
there we are . 
Mummy (h)as got the egg+cup with water now . 
you put the daisys very gently into the egg+cup . 
that's right . 
one and +... [+ IN] 
two . 
lovely [?] . 
now go and find the buttercup that's on Dobbin's head . 
that's right . 
it's yellow . 
you put them in there as well . 
look at all these flowers . 
they're floating in the water „ aren't they ? 
aren't they pretty ? 
yeah aren't they small compared to those big lilys that Mummy (h)as got on the mantelpiece ? 
that's right . 
they're floating in the water . 
the stay alive longer „ don't they ? 
wow . 
put it onto the water . 
that's right . 
they're very pretty flowers aren't they ? 
six ? 
no there's three . 
two daisys and one buttercup . 
when Grandma comes tomorrow you can show her these flowers . 
and you can say “Grandma picked you some flowers” . 
no ? 
do you not think she'll like them ? 
we're going to see my Mummy on Thursday and she is called Daisy . 
so you could take my Mummy some daisys „ couldn't you ? 
no ? 
oh dear . 
what a mess . 
we've spilt the water „ haven't we ? 
yes we have . 
why do you keep saying no ? 
where (h)as the yellow gone ? 
it's there . 
it just floated behind the daisy for a moment . 
can you see now how the petals are closing up ? 
can you see how these daisy petals +/. [+ IN] 
<yes [?] they're> [<] pretty flowers „ aren't they ? 
buttercups and daisys . 
I'm sure we know xxx but I can't think of it . [+ PI] 
wash . 
that's right . 
we needta get the cloth out because we spilt most of the water on the floor „ haven't we ? 
so buttercups and daisys grow on the grass „ don't they ? 
oh a good boy . 
aren't you a good boy ? 
you're bringing the hand towel to wipe the floor . 
you must have been here the other night when Daddy spilt that bottle of milk . 
you were . 
because he went running for the hand towel to try to clean it up so that Mummy wouldn't know . 
but Mummy did know , didn't she ? 
oh that's right . 
are you passing me the towel ? 
that's a good boy . 
Bow's food oh dear . 
I don't think I can see any dandelions Thomas on the grass . 
we saw those really [?] when were going for a walk „ didn't we ? 
where (h)as the gone ? 
in the egg+cup here . 
yellow . 
there we are . 
Mummy's just washing this beaker . 
can you see the flowers on this mug ? 
they're like daisys „ aren't they ? 
can you see the petals on the flowers ? 
and inside in the centre there's a circle . 
look at the colors on this . 
and this , Thomas . 
no . 
put that back . 
just have a little piece . 
xxx a little piece . [+ PI] 
you can have some but just a little piece . 
oh look . 
this is your bib . 
you wore this at lunch+time . 
it has flowers growing on a garden and a picture of the sun . 
there are two flowers . 
they look like daisys . 
they each got yellow centres . 
in a way they look more like pansys because they've got two eyes and a smily mouth . 
but they've got petals . 
this one has red petals . 
this one has blue petals . 
and they have stalks and leafs . 
so when we're next going out for a walk Thomas we'll see if we can see some more dandelions [?] . 
and you can blow them „ can't you ? 
choc_choc@f ? 
you'd like some choc_choc@f ? 
no ? 
I think you probably would . 
let Mummy just give you a little piece , Thomas . 
just a little piece . 
you can't have all that . 
you can't have all that . 
that's right . 
break your piece up . 
good boy .
