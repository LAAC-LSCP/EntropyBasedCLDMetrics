ah [=! chuckles] . 
one [<] of her kitten's called Bamboo „ isn't it [>] ? 
she probably wouldn't take any notice . 
but Georgia will know when Purdie dies . 
because she only lives opposite „ doesn't she ? 
because we'll tell her . 
he is . 
is that what it says on that piece of wood ? 
Thomas danger . [+ R] 
quite dangerous having a Thomas in the house . 
it's quite dangerous having a Thomas in the house . 
isn't it ? 
that fits very well at the bottom of that slide , , doesn't it ? 
I don't think you should use that as a hammer , Thomas . 
because that's part of another toy . 
and if it gets broken [>] +/. [+ IN] 
well the other part's missing „ isn't it ? 
so one part's missing [>] . 
yes [<] please . 
one part's missing . 
and if this part's broken . 
then we'll be in a right mess with the toy „ won't we [>] ? 
won't work at all then . 
it sounds a very strange factory for [//] to me . 
sausages coming down from the sky and +... [+ IN] 
it doesn't seem right . 
well I've never seen a fire engine fly . 
I've seen sometimes +... [+ IN] 
television pictures of when there's . 
say a bad forest fire . 
and shoot water out „ don't they ? 
they jet water down . 
but I've never seen a fire engine . 
swinging in the sky like that . 
0 [=! chuckles] . 
is [<] there actually a fire at the sausage factory ? 
or is it just putting the oven out ? 
well surely it would be better just to +... [+ IN] 
+, turn the oven off „ wouldn't it ? 
and let it cool down . 
you really need the fire brigade to come out ? 
so does this happen every single day ? 
that the foot [//] sausage factory's working ? 
but what happens if there's a cat stuck up a tree ? 
or an accident or a proper fire ? 
and the fire engine's busy putting your +... [+ IN] 
+, oven out . 
is that not dangerous ? 
well that must be very expensive . 
but what I was meaning was if . 
if there was a house fire . 
and you needed the fire in an emergency and they . 
they said “oh sorry the fire engine's busy” . 
+" putting the oven out . 
and somebody could be hurt . 
while the fire engine's busy <doing that job for you> [>] . 
you seem to be having more and more fire engines . 
the ladders ? 
just gently don't break it , Thomas . 
well [<] just do it &gent +//. [+ IN] 
pass it to me . 
just do it gently . 
well don't +//. [+ IN] 
that's it . 
that's it . 
just very gently . 
slide it back in . 
because this is the only fire engine with +... [+ IN] 
+, ladders that works now „ isn't it ? 
well would you like to pass it to me , Thomas ? 
and we'll sort it out . 
rather than forcing <it and breaking it> [>] . 
there you are . 
<they don't> [<] (.) seem to be very stable fire engines . 
those toy fire engine ladders . 
oh [<] well they hafta „ don't they ? 
at least I would hope they would be . 
this [/] this does seem to happen with all yours . 
and I don't (.) quite understand what the problem is . 
<there we are> [<] . 
they don't hate being your toys . 
<you're a nice little boy> [<] . 
there you are fixed . 
perhaps the poor ladders are worn out if they . 
hafta keep putting <the &fa> [//] the oven out in your factory . 
could &or [//] imagine ordinary fire engines proper fire engines . 
wouldn't hafta use the ladders every time . 
because some fires that they go to . 
they wouldn't needta use ladders . 
yes but that's what I mean if they hafta . 
put the ladders up to put your fire out . 
every single day . 
poor ladders are probably worn out . 
mind all those things . 
I don't think the fireman would be very pleased . 
because if he thought while he was trying to put it out . 
you were in the control room making it hotter „ do you ? 
now what's that do ? 
does it ? 
what because your botty's [: bottom's] hurting ? 
I don't think <<they'll deal> [?] with that> [>] . 
well I thought we were playing this . 
in a few minutes I think it's time to go and brush your teeth . 
and then we'll get you changed . 
because we're going out later „ aren't we ? 
Thomas , no . 
no . 
come here please now . 
Thomas , I shall get cross . 
turn it off now . 
do as you're told . 
you're not allowed to <touch that> [>] . 
what's your favorite program ? 
not just yet . 
I thought you were still playing with this ? 
well you needta pick all these things up . 
before you can watch television . 
why don't you park everything at the side . 
put the fire engine away . 
and this piece of wood and then you . 
can move the other things to the side . 
don't hide it under there because we won't +//. [+ IN] 
Thomas . 
come on because we won't know where it is . 
and is this still at the factory ? 
this little sound . 
and what does that do ? 
because if you're packing up the factory . 
surely you don't want the oven getting hotter now ? 
it isn't „ is it ? 
well will it not go on the box ? 
well it belongs on that box , Thomas . 
well if you put it on the box [>] +/. [+ IN] 
well [<] it's only a +... [+ IN] 
+, moment to move it „ isn't it [>] ? 
<Thomas , I'm just putting it on this box here> [<] . 
listen if it's left lying around +... [+ IN] 
you don't hafta move anything . 
to get it out you just . 
pick it off the top of the box . 
it's not even in the &bo +/. [+ IN] 
now [<] listen . 
if you leave it on the floor . 
Daddy will get annoyed . 
or worse still he'll accidentally tread on it . 
because it's [//] you've just said yourself it's . 
not [/] not very stable „ is it ? 
<and if he> [<] treads on it you won't have a toy then . 
it'll hafta go in the bin . 
I will , love . 
where is it ? 
right . 
come on . 
<put the xxx back on> [<] . [+ PI] 
this is team effort , Thomas . 
I'm holding the (.) sweeper [//] the +... [+ IN] 
+, dustpan and you're brushing up „ aren't you ? 
yes [<] I think I'll let you get it all into a pile . 
before I (.) <stand there> [>] holding that . 
you look like somebody who's blind with a white stick . 
it's the handle from the brush „ isn't it ? 
oh yes being on crutches is . 
hurts under your arms a lot to be on crutches . 
well because you're putting all the weight on the +... [+ IN] 
you're using your arms instead . 
of your legs to walk „ aren't you ? 
well you can use one leg but &-uh +... [+ IN] 
+, you [<] needta put your weight on the sticks . 
right [<] . 
would you like me to put the brush head back on ? 
<and then after this> [<] . 
you don't play with it again , Thomas . 
because it's going to get broken . 
no [<] . 
Thomas [<] , that's been sweeping the floor . 
don't put it in your hair . 
there you are . 
no . 
my arms are fine .

keep sweeping quick [/] quick .

oh here's Purdie in . 
quick [/] quick , Thomas . 
oh now your brush head's fallen off . 
just use the brush head to sweep it in by hand . 
Purdie doesn't sound happy „ does she ? 
well you didn't manage that in the time „ did you ? 
that reminds me of that Bob_The_Builder book . 
you got for your birthday . 
where you've got to turn the timer . 
and you've got so many seconds . 
to do all the jobs on each page . 
do you remember ? 
you turn the timer round . 
and each page asks you to do a little task . 
and you've got to do it before the . 
sixty seconds are up and the pinger goes bing@o [/] bing@o . 
right . 
<I'm going to> [<] +/. [+ IN] 
no . 
well I'd like you to just <carry on tidying that up> [>] . 
okay . 
don't rush so much , Thomas . 
that by rushing so much you make more of a mess . 
just do it slowly and gently . 
take your time [>] . 
I will when it's finished . 
is this what you make the men do at the factory ? 
at the end of the day xxx sausages ? [+ PI] 
it isn't . 
you've nearly finished . 
right [>] . 
are you going to go and tip them back into the box now ? 
it is . 
well shall I put them back in the box for you ? 
you look after that one . 
I will . 
watch your fingers , Thomas . 
<I can> [<] hear the pitter@o patter@o yes . 
have you ? 
who said that ? 
oh [>] . 
your bottom's nice . 
because you've got a brush attached .

are you going to put those away now ? 
put the handle back on the +... [+ IN] 
the head back on the brush , darling . 
no . 
put the head back on , Thomas . 
<before you put it away> [>] . 
because when we wanna use it again especially in a hurry . 
it won't be ready „ will it ? 
no . 
you'll hafta do it before it's hooked up , Thomas . 
no . 
it's going to fall off again . 
<come on let's do it properly> [>] . 
<come on> [<] . 
<Thomas , don't> [<] it's been useta brush floors . 
do you know what these little rough bits are <for there> [>] ? 
if you needta scrape the brush for any reason . 
if you needta give the brush a quick clean . 
you rub it along there . 
that's what they're for . 
right [<] . 
you're puffed out ? 
right . 
are you going to park your breakdown truck ? 
or whatever you were calling it today ? 
what was it a delivery truck ? 
I can't remember . 
what was it , Thomas ? 
did you not ? 
why don't you stand the lego tractor and trailer in the back ? 
and then that's tidied it all up . 
well thank you .

musical mayhem is trampling [?] Sergeant Major . [+ R]

Sergeant Major was patrolling his garden . [+ R] 
to make sure that everything was straight . [+ R] 
he didn't like anything that wasn't . [+ R] 
straight square or even . [+ R] 
he would often do a round on his hands . [+ R] 
and knees measuring the height of the grass . [+ R] 
and snipping off any blades that were too high . [+ R] 
one day a butterfly landed on one of . [+ R] 
Sergeant Major's daffodils and made the . [+ R] 
stem bend a little . [+ R] 
shoo butterfly said Sergeant Major loudly . [+ R] 
Sergeant Major always spoke very loudly . [+ R] 
because he'd been in the army so long . [+ R] 
stop bending my flower . [+ R] 
he ordered . [+ R] 
0 [=! gasps] . 
the butterfly fluttered off to Trampy's garden . [+ R] 
where he wouldn't be disturbed . [+ R] 
in Trampy's garden nothing was straight . [+ R] 
square or even . [+ R] 
flowers and bushes grew just how they wanted to . [+ R] 
the grass was never cut . [+ R] 
it was a very relaxed sort of garden . [+ R]

there were no plants hanging over the fence . [+ R] 
between Sergeant Major and Trampy's garden . [+ R] 
Sergeant Major was always on the look out for . [+ R] 
any untidiness coming from Trampy's side of the fence . [+ R] 
Sergeant Major was very pleased to see all . [+ R] 
the tidiness and started . [+ R] 
to march around the lawn . [+ R]

he hummed marching along cheerfully . [+ R] 
but then his concentration was broken . [+ R] 
by a strange sound coming from Trampy's garden . [+ R] 
a strange soft (.) whistling sound . [+ R] 
Sergeant Major marched to the fence . [+ R] 
what's that din he bellowed ? [+ R] 
Trampy ? [+ R] 
what is that racket you're making ? [+ R] 
Trampy was sitting in an old deck chair relaxing . [+ R] 
he was holding a long thin musical instrument . [+ R] 
he held it up for Sergeant Major to see . [+ R] 
it's a penny whistle he said . [+ R] 
a what ? 
bellowed Sergeant Major a look of amazement on his face . [+ R] 
a penny whistle . [+ R] 
replied the relaxed Trampy listen . [+ R] 
he put the whistle to his lips . [+ R] 
and played a little tune . [+ R] 
that was like a wind . [+ R] 
like the wind tinkling through a crystal chandelier . [+ R] 
that's [<] horrible that is said Sergeant Major . [+ R] 
can't you play any proper music like a good march ? [+ R] 
Trampy stopped playing and looked at Sergeant Major . [+ R] 
I don't like marches he said . [+ R] 
Sergeant Major was speechless . [+ R] 
for about three seconds . [+ R] 
you don't like marches he bellowed . [+ R] 
in a voice that was even louder than before . [+ R] 
well we'll see about that . [+ R] 
he did a smart about turn and marched into Drill hall . [+ R] 
his house . [+ R]
