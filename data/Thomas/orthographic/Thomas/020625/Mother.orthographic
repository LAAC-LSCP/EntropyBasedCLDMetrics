is that the noise +/. [+ N] 
a lot of steam ? 
whoosh ? 
that <sounds more> [>] like a train than a bin bag lorry , Thomas .

so you're definitely talking about steam trains „ aren't you ? 
Gordon's cross ? 
Gordon's grumpy ? 
<are you> [>] +... [+ N] 
and <&Gra> [//] James is cross and Gordon's grumpy .

no Bertie there ?

and Toby's one of the little engines as well „ isn't he ?

or is it your Thomas_The_Tank_Engine book ? 
no thanks ? 
no . 
I'm asking where you've been reading [//] hearing about all these engines . 
you've got several Thomas_The_Tank_Engine books „ haven't you ?

oh right . 
what did you do in Sainsburys ? 
no Marks ? 
did you go to Marks and Spencers ? 
oh Grandma said you had . 
oh did [/] did you not go in . 
perhaps it was just Grandma and you Granddad waited outside „ did you ? 
Marks and Spencers was shut ? 
I don't think it was . 
perhaps they saw Grandma coming and closed the doors „ did they ? 
because they thought oh she'll be bringing that Thomas_Henry Lastname . 
oh you told me about that little baby you saw yesterday . 
he couldn't stand up . 
it was only nine weeks old . 
and he couldn't stand up „ could he ? 
and what was he called ? 
he was called <Thomas> [?] . 
and his Grandma asked you what you were called . 
and you said +... [+ N] 
you said “Thomas_Henry Lastname two and a half” . 
she said “what's your name” ? 
and you said “Thomas_Henry Lastname two and a half” . 
she hasn't got a big tummy .

which shirt would you like to wear ?

would you like that one ? 
or would you like that one ? 
well it's one of them . 
you wanna sleep first ?

you can't sleep across the road . 
well that was when we were doing one of the leaf pictures on a piece of red paper . 
and <as the glue got wet it made them both> [//] as the glue hit the paper it made the paper wet and the red dye came out „ didn't it ? 
are you going to tell me which shirt please ? 
oh this one . 
it's a bit warmer . 
you've got to put a shirt on . 
or would you like the other one on ? 
oh , Thomas . 
you've got to put a shirt on .

and then everybody can see your big tummy . 
if you haven't got <your vest on> [//] your shirt on we can see your vest and your big tummy . 
got a little sore place behind your knee . 
does it hurt , Thomas ? 
the leaf (h)as fallen over ? 
the bin bag lorry (h)as got to come ? 
no . 
I don't think the bin bag lorry would come just for one little +/. [+ N] 
Tellytubbies and Thomas_The_Tank_Engine ? 
no Teletubbies . 
ouch . 
these are new trousers and they're a bit big „ aren't they ? 
I'm going to hafta roll the bottoms up a bit . 
Thomas .

oh you've gone off kissing people „ haven't you ? 
can Mummy kiss you instead ? 
I can't ? 
I can ! 
I can and I will . 
isn't that what the engine says ? 
Thomas I can and I will . 
I can and I will . 
I can and I will . 
xxx [<] . 
Dimitra (h)as had a drink ? 
it's done ? 
it (h)as gone in her tummy „ has it ? 
oh . 
you've got a scratch on your face . 
and what happened to you ? 
the zip hurt me ? 
the zip hurt you „ didn't it ? 
you were fastening the zip on your coat and as I pulled the zip up you put your head down and we had an accident „ didn't we ? 
and the zip bit you „ didn't it ? 
it won't bite you again . 
no . 
when we're doing zips now we're very [/] very careful „ aren't we ? 
oh who's a smart boy ! 
yes ! 
no . 
no shoes on yet . 
well let's put your slippers on because you're playing inside „ aren't you ? 
this morning . 
you're not running away . 
you're very loud this morning , Thomas . 
leaves blowing off the tree ? 
can you see that +/. [+ N] 
no . 
it won't . 
some of them might be crunchy . 
but when we went for a walk the other day it had been raining „ hadn't it ? 
and the leaves had got soggy and they didn't crunch „ did they ? 
in fact they were quite slippery to walk on „ weren't they ? 
your hair will be better when it settles down . 
Dimitra <is sitting down> [>] . 
you want Dimitra to join us at the table „ do you ? 
oh you are cheeky , Thomas . 
right . 
Mummy's going to wash her hands now . 
look . 
you got this yesterday when you were out shopping . 
one of the shops was giving these away . 
oh I thought you (h)ad show Dimitra what you got . 
xxx . 
Mummy's washing her hands . 
yes . 
I'm squirting something on the table to give it a clean . 
is Dimitra at the table too ? 
Daddy_Rod ? 
no . 
Daddy_Rod isn't here . 
who's Daddy_Rod ? 
Isabelle's Daddy is called Rod . 
it's Isabelle's Daddy and Sonia's husband . 
we've seen quite a lot of them „ haven't we ? 
oh you're talking about +/. [+ N] 
last week +//. [+ N] 
or it might have been earlier this week you were building some lego with Isabelle . 
and it got knocked over because the bricks fell down . 
what did you shout ? 
oh no . 
there you are . 
would you like to dry your hands on the towel please . 
you going to calm down a little bit ? 
well I think you've thrown the other one down „ haven't you ? 
what's on the front of this bib ? 
a caterpillar . 
that's right . 
and sunshine . 
and a piece of leaf too ? 
would you like some Cornflakes or Rice_Krispies , Thomas ? 
some bread ? 
some toast ? 
right . 
there's no needta shout . 
<no no> [/] no . 
yes we can . 
I know you can . 
that's from Bob_The_Builder „ isn't it ? 
because he [//] somebody says “can we fix it” and Bob says +... [+ N] 
+, yes we can . 
oh what's that ? 
is that the toasting machine ? 
the toaster ? 
what else does the toaster say when the toast is ready ? 
pop . 
don't shout . 
shh . 
oh it will hurt if you bite . 
in a minute it'll be ready . 
what would you like on your toast ? 
no marmalade . 
no . 
but what about marmite ? 
no ? 
what about cheese ? 
jam ? 
just toast ? 
oh , Thomas Lastname . 
just dry toast ? 
no . 
xxx just dry toast „ do we . 
jam ? 
which ? 
oh no way ! 
<I should think> [<] we all like it . 
but do you know why it's in the fridge ? 
it's in the fridge because it was the only place I could think of last night to hide it from you . 
and you've seen it . 
well you can have one piece each . 
what do we do with an orange ? 
tap it . 
and unwrap it . 
that's what the advert useta say . 
tap it and unwrap it . 
only I can't actually . 
I'm going to just +... [+ N] 
now if you have this you've got to eat your toast . 
right . 
it's all gone now . 
we're saving the rest for Daddy . 
all gone . 
what <a thing> [>] to have +... [+ N] [+ PI] 
tasty ? 
or did you say “taste it” ? 
what a thing to have for breakfast , Thomas . 
oh ! 
no . 
that's not nice . 
www . 
strawberries ? 
we don't have any strawberries but you can have some strawberry jam . 
you've finished as well ? 
I see . 
and was it nice ? 
you enjoyed it ? 
good . 
I'm very pleased . 
no more chocolate now though . 
who would like one ? 
yes . 
Mummy would like one . 
but it's a little early in the morning , Thomas . 
I'm going to &-uh +... [+ N] 
I like a piece of chocolate with a cup of coffee at night <once you've gone to bed> [>] . 
once you've gone to bed Mummy and Daddy have a cup of coffee „ don't we ? 
and that's when I like to have a chocolate . 
Mummy usually just has one chocolate so a box lasts Mummy a good long while . 
but Daddy can't put them down „ can he ? 
in fact we thought Daddy must be ill last night because we offered Daddy a piece of chocolate orange and he said “no thank you” . 
thought Daddy was ill . 
excuse me . 
www . 
oh that was Sue from work . 
pardon ? 
pass the fire engine please ? 
oh right . 
we'll I'll get your fire engine . 
because the firemen usually likes to share a piece of toast with you „ doesn't he ? 
Thomas please don't shout . 
would you like some cheese with that ? 
no +... [+ N] 
no +... [+ N] 
what's the little word ? 
no thank you ? 
and what do you say now I've brought you this ? 
thank you . 
that's better . 
much better . 
and the policeman ? 
I knew you'd want the policeman . 
for the past last few meals that's all you wanted . 
to share it with the fireman and the policeman . 
now you've got to share your toast <with them> [?] . 
and the postman ? 
you'd like to share your toast with the postman „ would you ? 
has the fireman been busy ? 
what (h)as he been doing ? 
he (h)as been doing what ? 
climbing the ladders ? 
was that to put a fire out ? 
or to rescue a pussy cat ? 
I think if the fireman's called out to rescue a pussy cat he probably doesn't put his siren on , Thomas . 
or his flashing lights . 
here you are . 
there's some cheese . 
it smells very strong . 
I'm going to pinch a piece . 
please may I ? 
would you like one ? 
can you find his face ? 
his face goes all over „ doesn't it ? 
that's when he's very hot . 
when he (h)as been racing in his car and he's all hot and bothered . 
and that when he's just driving along quietly . 
there you are . 
if he's resting now having his breakfast he's probably got a white face . [+ I] 
<his pale face> [>] . 
that's when he gets all hot and all 0 [=! makes noise] hot and bothered . 
hot and bothered . 
you dropped the policeman ? 
Thomas bite it too ? 
peel an apple for you . 
do you think Dimitra would like an apple ? 
would you like an apple Dimitra ? 
oh I've got more apples . 
would you like one ? 
pardon , darling ? 
don't worry . 
policeman having some cheese ? 
yes . 
bite it too . 
we're going to go to the supermarket later today , Thomas . 
and I think tomorrow we'll go to the Beehive . 
because we haven't had any playgroups to go to this week . 
and there's no bang^a^drum^time@c tomorrow because it's half term . 
is it going backwards ? 
I think the policeman's sitting in the fire engine and the fireman's sitting in the police car . 
have they swapped round ? 
or are they sharing ? 
like we tell you and Isabelle to share ? 
the fireman's sharing the police car . 
and the policeman's sharing the fire engine . 
that's nice „ isn't it ? 
when they share ? 
and are they sharing your breakfast ? 
you're a good boy letting them share „ aren't you ? 
“in a minute” you're eating cheese ? 
they're coming back for some more „ are they ? 
is the jam nice ? 
what kind of jam is it ? 
red jam ? 
strawberry jam ? 
no ? 
I think it is . 
were you making a tower out of the cheese „ were you ? 
it's lovely <when all> [?] these clip together „ isn't it ? 
that's really very nice . 
yes . 
they've stopped now . 
I can hear a noise . 
do you think it's Linda and Brian doing some vacuuming ? 
no ? 
Gordon grumpy ? 
and James cross . 
Thomas is cross too ? 
do you mean you're cross ? 
or Thomas_The_Tank_Engine's cross ? 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine's cross . 
why is he cross ? 
pardon ? 
who's being a nuisance ? 
being a nuisance in the dark ? 
who's being a nuisance in the dark ? 
hit [?] the wood ? 
it sounds like you're talking about shake . 
but I don't know +//. [+ N] 
it must be a story you read or something you've heard . 
they've come back for some more ? 
what are they doing ? 
eating cheese ? 
I can see the flashing lights on the police car but the fire engine doesn't seem to have any lights . 
the fire engine's hose moves „ doesn't it ? 
as it's going along . 
can you see ? 
and what comes out of the hose ? 
water ? 
water . 
to put the fire out . 
they just seem to be driving up and down the road , Thomas . 
have they not got a fire to go to ? 
oh they're going to Pippin's house „ are they ? 
where's the fire ? 
there ? 
they're at Pippin's house now „ are they ? 
have you bumped your foot ? 
you didn't . 
you knocked your juice over . 
your foot's here . 
this is your foot . 
you've got a scratch on your face . 
how did that happen ? 
you don't know ? 
it's like a steam roller „ is it ? 
Bob_The_Builder ? 
I think Thomas is saying nappie change because the pot looks like the pot of cream that we use when Thomas has his nappie changed . 
oh you say craner@c when you mean crane „ don't you ? 
oh what (h)as happened ? 
oh lovely . 
thank you . 
oh presents . 
whose birthday is it today ? 
Grandma's ? 
it's Grandma's birthday „ isn't it ? 
oh <that's lovely> [>] . 
I'll put mine there for later . 
aren't they pretty ? 
did you fall over ? 
oh [<] . 
gosh just be careful . 
Mummy will take Purdie and go and get some food for her . 
come along , Purdie . 
Purdie's going to go out before having some breakfast , Thomas . 
no . 
don't try and pick her up . 
oh , Thomas .
