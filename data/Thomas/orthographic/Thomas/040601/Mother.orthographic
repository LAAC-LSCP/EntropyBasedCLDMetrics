you won't do this yet (be)cause you can't reach but +... [+ IN] 
quite often (.) when people visit other people's house [*] +... [+ IN] 
do you know how you always wanna go upstairs ?

you know where [//] the cupboard we've got in the bathroom ?

I don't know why people look in them . 
I don't do it . 
but I know people have done it here (be)cause you can tell .

and because this man knew that his friend sometimes peeped in his cabinet +... [+ IN] 
when he was having a party (.) he stuffed his cabinet full of little white ping pong balls . 
do you know the plastic ping pong balls ? 
so when his friends came round and opened the cupboard what happened ? 
all [<] the balls fell out .

(be)cause they were trying to put them all back and it's really hard trying to stuff a cupboard full of ping pong balls (be)cause you can't do it with the door open . 
so you hafta sort of do it quick then shut the door . 
so that's xxx [>] . [+ PI] 
so that's a bit naughty (be)cause you shouldn't really look in people's cupboards „ should you ? 
but (.) he knew his friends were doing this and he got them back „ didn't he ?

that they'd seen ping pong balls (be)cause they shouldn't have been there in the first place .

when medicine's in there you're sposta have it locked „ aren't you ? 
<I know> [<] . 
I've just done that . 
no . 
our medicine cabinet isn't locked (be)cause I don't don't keep the medicine in the bathroom . 
I just keep talcum powder and soap and toothpaste and things in there . 
our medicines are in this big cupboard in the kitchen . 
and that's locked „ isn't it ?

it's only round the corner . 
quarter of an hour walk at the very most . 
well perhaps a little bit longer .

you and Daddy had eaten quicker than me and you'd eaten yours . 
and I had just a little bit left and that seagull just came along and swooped . 
and took it out of my hand „ didn't he ? 
it really frightened me . 
actually he scratched my hand as he flew off and that hurt for a long time afterwards . 
were you quite shocked ? 
(be)cause when he swooped off with my sandwich he flew right above your head „ didn't he ? 
hm . 
I think he'd been watching me for a long time and he must have thought (.) I'm going [?] to have the sandwich from that woman . 
no .

he can't have had all of it because we've just had a little piece „ haven't we ? 
so do you really not want that sandwich ? 
I'll pop it in a box for later .
