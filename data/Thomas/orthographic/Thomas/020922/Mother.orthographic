you jumping ? 
right . 
let's get you dressed . 
xxx . 
oh dear . 
we've hadta just sit you in the bath „ haven't we ? 
because you've come back from playgroup . 
and you were a little bit wet . 
oh dear [/] dear . 
you want a sweetie ? 
well we've got some sausage rolls for lunch „ haven't we ? 
we're going to have those in a moment . 
no thanks ? 
you can't have sweeties . 
you've had a couple of biscuits while you've been walking home „ haven't you ? 
because Jo was giving Becky biscuits . 
and she gave you some „ didn't she ? 
is that Mummy's ring ? 
I keep scratching you „ don't I ? 
I'm very sorry , sweetheart . 
oh it hurts . 
you've got to go in an ambulance „ have you ? 
well I can understand me scratching you with this ring . 
because this is the one that Daddy bought Mummy for Christmas . 
and it's quite big . 
but this one (.) the engagement ring (.) we've had this on ever since we had you . 
I've been wearing this all long as I've had you . 
and I <don't think I've scratched you before> [>] . 
well not yet , Thomas . 
no . 
after lunch perhaps . 
and then when we've had lunch today (.) we're going to go to Didsbury .

there we are . 
would you like to lie back , sweetheart ? 
oh nice pillow . 
you look nice and comfy . 
are you not ? 
oh it's hot ? 
why is it hot ? 
it's a dustbin bag . 
it doesn't look hot too me . 
dustbin bags are full of doggy poo ? 
Jess ? 
you've got marks all underneath your chin . 
and do you know what I think it is ? 
little spots . 
I think it's that hat you wear . 
isn't it ? 
because it fastens with velcro . 
and I think it must be rubbing under your chin . 
you've got lots_of little spots . 
is it sore ? 
it's not sore ? 
that feels sore ? 
well you've scratched yourself on your chest „ haven't you ? 
you've got two little places on your chest that have been bleeding . 
because you've scratched them . 
I'll hafta start putting some mittens on you . 
like I did when you were a baby . 
when you were a tiny baby we <useta> [<] put some little cotton mittens on you called scratch mittens . 
so that you didn't scratch yourself . 
and hurt yourself with your nails . 
I don't understand it though . 
because your fingernails are really very short „ aren't they ? 
we cut them often enough they're +//. [+ IN] 
looking at them now they're ever so short . 
no . 
I'm not cutting them now . 
we cut them the other day „ didn't we ? 
and your toenails . 
do you remember when we cut your toenails ? 
it didn't hurt . 
it shouldn't have hurt . 
the only time it might hurt is if you're wriggly piggily . 
and the scissors slipped . 
but I don't think we've done that „ have we ? 
what am I doing now ? 
I'm just getting you dressed . 
does that hurt , darling ? 
no ? 
there we are . 
you can see chocolates round there „ can you ?

<what have> [<] you done ? 
bumped your chin on my head ? 
you not like heads ? 
well it was quite painful I would imagine „ was it ? 
you bumped your teeth ? 
oh you bumped your chin ? 
right . 
we'll put your track suit bottoms on . 
then we'll dress you in some other trousers before we go out . 
and I think we (h)ad better give your shoes a bit of a wipe „ don't you ? 
right , sweetheart . 
would you like to sit down ? 
you're cold ? 
well let's put your slippers on your foot . 
you've no socks on .

it'll keep you nice and warm „ won't it ? 
there you are .

no ? 
oh . 
you don't like sausage rolls ? 
well you asked for them when we went to the Spa shop especially to get them . 
and unfortunately because we're very boring we have sausage rolls every Tuesday . 
because it's quick and easy . 
oh it is easy , Thomas . 
because Mummy <doesn't have too> [>] +... [+ IN] 
Mummy doesn't hafta think about what she's going to give you . 
would you like some baked beans with them ? 
with sausage rolls ? 
the other thing I'm going to do . 
is just wet this hairbrush . 
and brush your hair . 
because your hair (h)as been sticking up all morning . 
I think it's because you've had your hat on . 
so I'll just wet your hair a little bit . 
how's that ? 
you like water ? 
it (h)as not really stayed down yet „ has it ? 
it's that little tufty bit there . 
oh has it splashed onto your track suit bottom ? 
oh dear . 
it's on ? 
you can see some little drops where the water splashed ? 
you rubbing yourself with the towel now .

a lady went past riding a horse .

<clippity_clop@o> [/] clippity_clop@o . 
that's right . 
no . 
it was a lady rider . 
she had a rider hat on . 
that's why you couldn't see her hair . 
and then as we went through the park she went through the park . 
and as we got quite near playgroup we thought she might be going to the playgroup . 
but she wasn't „ was she ? 
she carried on . 
and when we got to playgroup you were riding around on tricycles and tractor things „ weren't you ? 
bicycles . 
and a car . 
0 [=! sneezes] . 
excuse me . 
well Ben and Charlotte weren't there . 
Charlotte was there with her Mummy „ wasn't she ? 
and Lynne . 
that's right . 
and who else did you see ? 
we saw Karen with Laura . 
and Louise with Rachael . 
and Natalie with the other Rachael . 
why am I saying Natalie ? 
I mean Sian was there with Rachael and her sister Natalie . 
who's a tiny baby . 
and we saw Juliette with Michael and baby Jack . 
it's your scarf . 
no . 
don't put it on the floor , Thomas . 
that's a naughty boy . 
it is . 
because Mummy had it in her hand ready to hang on the coat stand . 
and you took it off Mummy and threw it on the floor . 
and when it came to song time and story time +/. [+ IN] 
they lit the birthday cake and sang happy birthday to someone .

and they gave her a birthday card . 
and we've got to go to Isabelle's party on Saturday . 
pardon ? 
what am I getting ? 
I was just going into the cupboard to see if we had any crisps .

I don't actually think we've got any crisps either , Thomas . 
I think you've eaten them all . 
but I'll just +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
I'm sorry . 
you've eaten them all . 
you've got some little cheese biscuits though , Thomas . 
would you like those ? 
<we're going to have> [<] to tidy this cupboard out „ aren't we ? 
I don't know what (h)as happened . 
but when you open the cupboard everything comes tumbling out . 
I'm looking for crisps . 
oh look . 
here's a few . 
oh this is a packet that you must have opened before . 
because I've put a little seal on it . 
let me just taste them . 
see if they're still fresh . 
mhm . 
there you are . 
put them on a plate for you . 
what's happening ? 
here's a sausage roll as well . 
I'll cut it up . 
how's that ? 
does that look nice ? 
there we are . 
and there's some apple . 
and a few grapes in the fridge . 
you didn't eat these at breakfast time „ did you ? 
do you not want them now either ? 
hm: . 
well leave them there just in case . 
why are you not eating fruit , Thomas ? 
you really useta eat such a lot of fruit . 
have you gone off fruit ? 
what would you like to drink ? 
Coke ? 
oh , Thomas . 
that's Daddy . 
because Daddy never useta +//. [+ IN] 
well we never had Coca_Cola in the house . 
and ever since Daddy (h)as been on a diet he (h)as been buying Diet_Coke as a little treat for himself . 
and he keeps leaving it on the worktop so you see it „ don't you ? 
you can have a tiny [/] tiny bit . 
and then if you need another drink you've got to have blackcurrant . 
there you are . 
what do you say ? 
it's dirty beer „ is it ? 
yes it is . 
there we are . 
I'll put it behind there . 
I'm just going to come and sit with you now . 
you like Coke ? 
yes . 
but when it (h)as gone <that's it> [<] , Thomas . 
so (.) don't drink it all now . 
have a little bit of sausage roll and then have a drink later . 
that's a sausage . 
out of the sausage roll . 
you can see on the <&ba> [//] beaker you've got James and Thomas and the fat controller ? 
pardon ? 
pardon ? 
oh bunny rabbits .

I hadn't realized that . 
yes . 
on the bottom of the drinking beaker . 
there's some grass and some bushes and some flowers . 
and some bunny rabbits . 
and they've got little white tails „ haven't they ? 
you've not seen Coke like that before ? 
oh [= laughing] . 
was it nice ? 
very fizzy ? 
hm: . 
you like beer ? 
well you mustn't drink a lot of it . 
it (h)as got too much sugar in it . 
you must be careful of your teeth as well „ haven't you ? 
we've brushed your teeth before going to playgroup this morning . 
and we'll be brushing them before going to bed . 
shall we brush them after lunch ? 
just one ? 
just one beer . 
because <if we> [/] if we brush them we'll get all that sugar in the Cola off your teeth „ won't we ? 
and you don't hafta go and see the dentist quite so often . 
mind you (.) having said you don't go often now . 
you just go for a check up „ don't you ? 
but we don't want them to hafta do any work on your teeth . 
hm: . 
you're having another sip of beer „ are you ? 
when we went to see Jo and Becky yesterday (.) Becky was calling her drink beer „ wasn't she ? 
that's Coca_Cola . 
it's not beer . 
have you ? 
right . 
there's no more now . 
<if you want> [<] another drink you've got to have orange or blackcurrant or water . 
well eat a bit more sausage first please . 
you've got to eat your meals . 
not just fill up on drinks . 
you don't like beer ? 
yuck ? 
little pips ? 
no . 
it's the pastry on the sausage roll . 
sausage rolls don't have pips in them „ do they ? 
are you enjoying that ? 
it's a nice big mouthful „ haven't you ? 
mhm . 
you can't talk . 
I was just thinking you've got so much in your mouth . 
I cut it into small pieces and then you put two pieces in together „ haven't you ? 
don't kick the table . 
pardon ? 
you're putting your feet under the table ? 
yes . 
well there [//] that's where they should be . 
under the table . 
but you mustn't start kicking the table leg . 
no , Thomas . 
don't be naughty . 
yes . 
stop it . 
you're cheeky „ aren't you ? 
mhm .

it's a nice day . 
the sun's out now „ isn't it ? 
it's lovely . 
where ? 
well look out of the window . 
well you're not going to see it if you screw your eyes up tight „ are you ? 
and we saw Maureen and the dog „ didn't we ? 
today ? 
she was walking through the park . 
is that all you're going to say to me “mhm [/] mhm” ? 
oh that was a different dog . 
yes . 
biting and sniffing the dustbin bags . 
yes . 
because we have our bins collected on Mondays „ don't we ? 
but [<] just behind us (.) the estate going up the hill (.) they have their collections on Tuesdays . 
so when we walked to toddler group we've always got to walk past a lot of bin bags on the side of the road „ haven't we ? 
and there was an elderly lady taking her doggy for a walk . 
and she was having an awful job trying to pull the dog past the bin bags . 
because the dog just wanted to sniff „ didn't he ? 
I wonder what was in the bin bag . 
no . 
I don't think there would be that . 
no . 
you don't put that in the dustbin . 
so that lady was having a job trying to get her dog to walk past . 
because he wanted to sniff . 
<I had> [<] a job to get you past because you wanted to watch the dustbin bags . 
Purdie's upside down ? 
you're tipping your chair back „ aren't you ? 
watch you don't fall off . 
there you are .

well what would you like ? 
blackcurrant or orange juice ? 
blackcurrant all day long ?

I like it . 
it's nice . 
you'd like blackcurrant in it now ?

I think we needta do it over here , Thomas . 
because the water's over here . 
can you keep it still ? 
put it flat on the table please . 
no . 
you're not to drink it yet . 
that's the Ribena juice . 
that's very [/] very strong . 
it's too strong to drink .

okay . 
water in from the water filter .

yes . 
you can drink it now . 
as long as you're very careful . 
and don't forget you've still got your second sausage roll to eat . 
so I don't want you going out this afternoon and being hungry . 
I think I'm going to eat a banana now . 
Thomas , would you like a banana ? 
alright then . 
well you finish your sausage roll then . 
when you've had your drink . 
oh [>] . 
what's like , daisy ? 
my Mummy's like a daisy ? 
my Mummy's called Daisy . 
why did you say that when I started to peel a banana ? 
why did you think of Grandma_Bealby ? 
there's a little sticker on the banana . 
did you think that looked like a daisy ? 
it's from the Winwood_Islands . 
<I think> [<] it's sposta be a palm tree on an island .

oh excuse me . 
very sorry .

if you put the lid on you've got to have a straw . 
why don't you eat some more sausage roll and then [>] you can have you drink later . 
I know you're having it now .

cheese and ham sandwiches ? 
at Jo's house ?

I'm very pleased . 
you've got a little red mark on your face now . 
where you've been lifting the beaker up to your mouth . 
I enjoyed that , Thomas . 
+" excuse me ? 
is that what you're saying “excuse me” . 
because you're coughing . 
I'm coughing as well . 
I think it's because it's quite cold outside . 
when we've been walking about . 
neither of us have a cough or cold „ do we ? 
but both our noses are a bit +/. [+ IN] 
because it's beautiful and sunny today . 
it's really quite nice .

eat some more sausage roll first , Thomas . 
I know you're thirsty . 
but you can't have any more to drink until you finish the sausage roll . 
this is why you were wet when you came back from playgroup . 
because you're really drinking far too much . 
and not eating enough . 
and you useta eat a lot more fruit than you're eating . 
and you +//. [+ IN] 
if you're eating juicy oranges and grapes (.) you don't feel quite so thirsty .

it's a street lamp „ is it , now ?

Auntie [<] +... [+ IN] 
Auntie_Mabel on the television program ? 
when they were showing Auntie_Mabel and the street lights episode . 
Auntie_Mabel said you must never touch street lamps in the street „ didn't she ?

do you remember her saying that ? 
Pippin wanted to sniff the street light „ did he ? 
and what did Auntie_Mabel say ? 
no@q . 
+" it's very dangerous ? 
you're building a street lamp ? 
by putting the lid on the beaker ? 
please have some more lunch now , Thomas . 
it's a little soldier boy rather than Father_Christmas . 
but he (h)as got a beard like Father_Christmas . 
although his is black . 
Father_Christmas has a white one . 
and he's wearing red and white like Father_Christmas „ isn't he ? 
I'm Father_Christmas and you're checking my street lamp ? 
street light ? 
very easily ? 
you're saying “very easily” because the lid went on very easily ? 
you're checking my street lamp ?

you've not had a lot to eat . 
just a bite to eat ?

what about some grapes ? 
or a piece of apple , Thomas . 
big fire ? 
what are you doing ? 
wrapping the little solider boy in your bib ? 
it's a fire ? 
lots_of fires in it ? 
it's a week today since Fred and Rachael's house caught fire „ isn't it ? 
that was Tuesday . 
but it was Tuesday tea time . 
not Tuesday lunchtime . 
because we were sitting having our meal „ weren't we ? 
and Mummy was getting ready to go out . 
I didn't go in the end . 
because we couldn't get out . 
because of the fire engine . 
and also we were looking after baby Miles „ weren't we ? 
yes &-uh (.) their house had a lot of smoke in it . 
you couldn't leave a baby in a house with a lot of smoke . 
is there smoke coming out of it ? 
well that's very clever of you <to be putting it out> [>] . 
he's your Fireman_Sam now „ is he ? 
the solider boy ?

you're Fireman_Sam and you're putting the fire out . 
you're putting lots_of water on the fire and the smoke . 
well that should sort it out , Thomas . 
certainly . 
is it better now ? 
well I'm very pleased . 
you've got your paper in your mouth ? 
you mean you've got your bib in your mouth ? 
why have you put it in your mouth ? 
it's your water +... [+ IN] 
water tray ? 
Purdie's tray ? 
<I'm not> [>] +... [+ IN] 
I'm not quite sure what you mean . 
Purdie has a litter tray . 
but she also has a tray in the kitchen . 
that we put on the floor . 
and on that tray we have her plate with her cat food . 
and a little bowl with water in it . 
<so what> [<] do you mean it's your tray and Purdie's tray ? 
not sure of what you mean , Thomas . 
it's Thomas_The_Tank now „ is it ? 
you mean the beaker is Thomas_The_Tank_Engine ? 
<oh no but listen , Thomas> [<] . 
just be careful with him . 
because if he falls on the floor he's going to smash . 
I'm not quite sure what Thomas_The_Tank_Engine is doing . 
is he ? 
oh because you're lying the beaker down ? 
you're saying he's having <a bit> [//] a nappie change ? 
we lie you down on the table „ don't we ? 
bit of leaf ? 
well I think that's a little bit of a label on the bottom of the beaker . 
because we tried and tried to get it off when it was new . 
and it just didn't seem to wanna come off . 
so there's a tiny bit of sticky still on the bottom „ isn't there ? 
I'm just folding up these blankets . 
<for your cot> [>] . 
you wanna make some big wooden bricks down on the floor ? 
building [<] your train ? 
right . 
well just give me one second to finish folding these . 
somebody strapped you in ? 
you wanna get down but somebody (h)as strapped you in ? 
well I strapped you in . 
because you're sitting in your booster seat . 
and we always strap you in when you're at the table . 
so that you can't get down and start wandering off . 
those blankets +//. [+ IN] 
we've washed them in a special wool wash .

yes . 
they smell beautiful . 
so they're lovely and soft and clean .

what about a tape ? 
not put the tape in the microwave ? 
well no . 
we're doing a tape now , Thomas . 
it's in the little mini disc recorder . 
oh do you +//. [+ IN] 
you mean you wanna play with your tape recorder ? 
right . 
are you sure you've finished this lunch ? 
absolutely sure ? 
you've finished Thomas_The_Tank work ? 
right . 
well I'll just wipe the table . 
then we'll wash our hands and face . 
and then I think +/. [+ IN] 
well they maybe not sticky but you still needta wipe them , Thomas . 
even though they're not sticky you've been eating crisps so they'll be a little bit salty . 
and you've been eating sausage roll pastry . 
so you've got the flaky bits on your fingers „ haven't you ? 
I'm going to put those blankets in the airing cupboard I think . 
to make sure they're properly dry . 
what are you putting on the floor ? 
crumbs ? 
oh don't do that , Thomas . 
because then we'll hafta get Noo_Noo out „ won't we ? 
and Noo_Noo's upstairs . 
so Mummy won't be very pleased if she (h)as got to walk all the way upstairs to carry the vacuum cleaner down . 
there we are . 
just a quick wipe on the table . 
that's all that's needed . 
I think most of the crumbs went on the plate anyway „ didn't they ? 
your jumper's all clean „ is it ? 
good . 
what have you done ? 
brushed the crumbs off your jumper ? 
are you ? 
you checking your tummy ? 
is everything in order ? 
bye bye . 
is everything as it should be , Thomas ? 
good . 
you're stuck ? 
why are you stuck ? 
you can see your fingers ? 
you're peeping it ? 
what have you done ? 
pulled your jumper head [//] jumper over your head ? 
right . 
now come on . 
let's quickly wipe your hands and face . 
and then we were going to brush your teeth „ weren't we ? 
no . 
but we've had Coca_Cola . 
we've had sticky things . 
and you had a biscuit at playgroup . 
you've had a lot of juice . 
I think a quick brush would be alright today . 
you do . 
because you're going to see your friends . 
Jake George and xxx this afternoon . [+ PI] 
<yes alright> [>] . 
you can get down once we've brushed your teeth . 
if you're going to kiss Georgia this afternoon she won't want you kissing her with smelly breath „ will she ? 
so there we are . 
you'll smell nice and fresh and minty . 
if you have you teeth brushed . 
it's only a quick brush . 
I'm not going to spend a long time . 
how's that ? 
let's do some rinsing . 
you're Thomas_The_Tank and a snake ? 
you're a snake „ are you ? 
I'm a lady ? 
oh very nice . 
right . 
we'll just give your hands another wipe . 
and your face . 
and then you can get down . 
you're crawling about over leaves ? 
what you mean when you're pretending to be a snake ? 
you're crawling about over leaves ? 
and grass . 
is that what the snakes were doing in Petsmart ? 
on Saturday ? 
or have you seen some snakes on the television ? 
no . 
I see . 
at Petsmart . 
you didn't see them on the television .

aren't they lucky having a room where they can sit with nice chairs .
