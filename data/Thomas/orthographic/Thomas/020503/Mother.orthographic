bin bag lorry .

yes . 
they should be back in a minute . 
well you've been asleep this afternoon „ haven't you ?

yes . 
but they [//] they've got all the bags together and look +//. [+ IN] 
they've put one pile here near our tree . 
and another there near Steven's house . 
and I can't see over at Sue's house because there's a car parked there . 
but I would imagine they've gathered some near Sue's house . 
so you missed that . 
and you missed the +//. [+ IN] 
what are you laughing at ? 
and you missed seeing the man coming round with the new bin bag for next week . 
but I'm sure the big lorry will be on it's way in a minute . 
and then when he (h)as been I think we should go for a walk . 
because it's such a beautiful afternoon . 
what did we do this morning ? 
no . 
we didn't go to big playgroup this morning . 
no . 
we haven't been to the playgroup . 
no . 
we haven't been to a party . 
you were helping me in the garden . 
and then we went round the estate on your bicycle . 
do you remember ? 
do you remember you were riding and I was pushing you with that special handle ? 
what's that funny noise ? 
I think it's probably the bin man on his way , Thomas . 
with the sound of the lorry „ won't it ? 
noise on it ? 
funny noise ? 
there is a funny noise „ isn't there ? 
the bin bag lorry .

so when the bin man +//. [+ IN] 
I can't say it . 
bin bag man (h)as been we'll go out . 
<we'll take> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
funny noise coming through the back door ? 
the back garden . 
well I think it's just the bin man coming round the back , Thomas . 
he'll be in front of the window in a minute . 
I think that's what you can hear . 
collecting the rubbish . 
yes . 
that's what he's doing . 
yes ? 
yes , darling ? 
what's going on ? 
that's right . 
well you're holding out the blue handle for your riser blocks that Mummy uses when I wanna push you round with „ isn't it ? 
can I have it back now please ? 
because it's not a toy „ is it ? 
big blue one toy ? 
no . 
it's a big blue handle . 
it fits onto the back of your bicycle . 
when you're just riding around on your own you don't need it . 
but when Mummy's pushing you she does . 
so I think we needta put it somewhere safe „ don't you ? 
oh and now you've got the extension hose from the Dyson vacuum cleaner . 
they're both big sticks „ aren't they ? 
big metal sticks . 
two ones . 
I've got a blue one .

oh you're pointing to the back garden . 
and you're talking about flashing lights . 
can you see the flashing lights on top of the bin bag lorry ? 
tell you what . 
please may I have this ? 
because it's not a toy „ is it , darling ? 
come on . 
yes . 
it'll be back in a minute . 
please may I put this back on the vacuum cleaner , darling . 
come on . 
you have that . 
why don't you hold Lala ? 
then Dipsy at the window . 
to see the bin bag lorry . 
and Molly . 
that's right . 
and you can't hold the vacuum cleaner thing as well . 
because Dipsy will be really interested in watching that . 
and have you shown Lala ? 
flashing lights from the bin bag lorry ? 
yes . 
no . 
it's not a bee bah . 
it doesn't have a siren „ does it ? 
fire engines police cars and ambulances all say bee^ba@o [/] bee^ba@o . 
but things like breakdown trucks and refuse lorrys have flashing lights . 
but they don't have the bee^ba@o to go with it „ do they ? 
rubbish .

we were brushing them off and Brian came back from the optician's and came to talk to us „ didn't he ? 
but you know what will happen , Thomas . 
the bin bag men will take the bin bags away . 
and one of them will burst . 
and there'll be rubbish all over the path . 
and then we'll hafta go out with the brush again .

I'm sure there must be some .

there's nothing more to see . 
Thomas .

I'll hold you up . 
but you don't climb in on your own . 
you'll end up going through that window . 
yes . 
but it's not worth going through a xxx window , Thomas . [+ PI] 
just to look at the bin bag lorry „ is it ?

you can cry all you like . 
just sit on the back of the chair .

I'll bet it's nice lying on the floor in the sun „ isn't it ? 
mhm . 
I thought you looked to be enjoying yourself . 
sounds like Uncle_Brian's cutting his grass again „ doesn't it ? 
can you hear that noise ? 
it sounds very loud . 
but I think we've got the bedroom windows open „ haven't we ? 
there is a big noise . 
yes . 
oop . 
another big noise now . 
what's that ? 
no . 
it's somebody reversing their car . 
one side of your face is very red , Thomas .
