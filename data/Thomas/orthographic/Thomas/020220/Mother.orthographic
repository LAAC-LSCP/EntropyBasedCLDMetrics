who's coming ? 
Nana choc_choc@f .

the fireman (h)as fallen out now and rolled on the floor . 
it's a little hole in the fire+engine so that it clips on to the police car like that . 
I don't think the policeman can really see where he's going Thomas because he's sitting in the car the wrong way round „ isn't he ?

what are you saying ? 
are you saying Jo time ? 
Jo time .

well sorry poppet . 
Mummy's ironing today but it's not because we're going to see Jo .

and she was very happy crawling around on the floor „ wasn't she at toddler group ? 
but then when we were coming home she went to sleep straight away in her pram „ didn't she ?

Purdie's outside . 
you were very very loving to Purdie last night before bedtime „ weren't you ? 
I think you were very tired and you were wondering along cuddling your blanket and you lay on the floor next to Purdie and you said night_night Bow . 
and you gave her a kiss on the top of her head . 
you were ever so gentle . 
you didn't attempt to pull her tail or squeal at all or do anything .
