you don't know ? 
well what have you just been doing outside in the garden ? 
you've been playing at a fireman „ haven't you ? 
you've had the hosepipe . 
and you've been going up and down the slide pretending it's a ladder . 
and you've had the hosepipe and you've been pretending to put out fires . 
bonfires . 
we've been doing <all sorts> [>] . 
is that what he does ? 
when you're watching Fireman_Sam on the television ? 
right . 
well Mummy went out to peg some washing up „ didn't she ? 
and [<] you came out with me . 
you've been playing in the garden .

I think he'll come in a few moments „ don't you ? 
you think he'll go fast ? 
you've got dirty hands „ haven't you ? 
been busy in the garden ? 
well once the dustbin man (h)as been we'll go back outside and hang some more washing up . 
are you going to help ? 
no ? 
you're not going to help me ? 
that's not nice „ is it ? 
well I'll go out on my own then . 
shall I go on my own ? 
not yet . 
what else have we done this morning ? 
we've been for a walk „ haven't we ? 
you looking at all the litter ? 
I think the men are coming now . 
our blinds have broken „ haven't they ? 
so +//. [+ IN] 
oh there they are . 
now you must wave . 
when he looks wave . 
see if he waves back . 
well normally we pull the blind back „ don't we ? 
so he can see you . 
but today the blind's broken . 
oh no . 
he (h)as not looked „ has he ? 
oh dear . 
nor has the other man . 
in goes the rubbish . 
oops . 
<he did „ didn't> [<] he ? 
oops . 
they've dropped a bag in the road . 
a box went in as well „ didn't it ? 
they're going now „ aren't they ? 
bye [<] [/] bye . 
right . 
they're going to pick up rubbish near Sue's house . 
there's another dustbin man . 
look . 
this one here .

not the driver . 
there's another man with lots_of black bags on him . 
can you see him ? 
can you see , Thomas ? 
look through this gap . 
right .

right . 
shall we go back outside and finish those jobs ? 
and then we'll come in and have some lunch ? 
yes ? 
would you like that ? 
no [/] no ? 
well I think we (h)ad better get on while the weather's still nice . 
because it might rain later on . 
a raspberry ? 
it's not a raspberry it's a battery . 
it's a battery „ isn't it ? 
you thought it was a raspberry ? 
well you've got some raspberries in the fridge . 
would you like some at lunchtime ? 
you need one now ? 
well it is lunchtime . 
let's go do our jobs and then we'll have lunch . 
okay ? 
yes . 
you're being a dustbin man „ are you ? 
okay . 
well I shall go out on my own and we'll talk later . 
I wonder if I'll see Fireman_Sam today ? 
do you think I will ? 
well I did hear something . 
yes . 
is it ? 
well I wonder if Fireman_Sam would like to come and have something to eat . 
he (h)as got flashing lights [>] ? 
Fireman_Sam would you like to come and join me to have something to eat ? 
I can't tell what you're saying , Thomas . 
pardon ? 
what are you saying ? 
a@p ditterwa@c ? 
what's a ditterwa@c ? 
I don't know what you're saying . 
pardon ? 
Fireman_Sam +... [+ IN] 
&=laughs . 
what are you saying ? 
I don't understand . 
oh were you in the garden ? 
you were being Fireman_Sam in the garden „ weren't you ? 
you had a hose . 
you had the hosepipe . 
well yes . 
you were pretending your steps on your slide were a ladder „ weren't you ? 
and +/. [+ IN] 
when we went into the shed we found that big pink windmill „ didn't we ? 
I think we took that down in the summer , Thomas . 
so that we could put the parasol on the patio table . 
and I think we must have forgotten all about it <and put it in the shed> [>] . 
we have got a shed . 
round the corner . 
you know the green dustbin where you keep all your toys ? 
things like your lawn mower and your wheelbarrow ? 
well that's standing outside of the shed . 
right . 
there you are . 
we've eaten already „ haven't we ? 
we've had something cooked today . 
so +/. [+ IN] 
<there's some> [>] . 
a hot meal . 
some pasta . 
so [>] +... [+ IN] 
alright . 
so there's some sandwiches and some crisps . 
we'll just have a little snack type tea . 
we've had a busy day . 
because we've walked all round the Randalls_Chain_Factory „ didn't we ? 
all round the railings . 
looking through the rails to see what rubbish people had dropped . 
and then we spent a long time in the garden . 
while Mummy pegged the washing out . 
that's funny . 
pardon ? 
we saw the dustbin men as well . 
that's right . 
Mummy was pegging washing out . 
and I cleaned down the patio table and chairs . 
and cleaned out the dustbin . 
and you were running round the garden and the dustbin men came „ didn't they ? 
and we watched them . 
and then (.) we had a little play inside . 
and we've been to Tesco with Jo and Becky just now „ haven't we ? 
that was good . 
we went in the car „ didn't we ? 
we were only there about half an hour but +/. [+ IN] 
Purdie's Pippin ? 
and am I Auntie_Mabel ? 
right . 
okay . 
and you're Fireman_Sam ? 
right . 
are those sandwiches nice ? 
are they your crisps ? 
yes . 
I haven't got any crisps . 
I think I'll have some , Thomas . 
now , Purdie . 
are you alright , sweetheart ? 
do you wanna go out ? 
and you've been such a good boy to Purdie over the past few days „ haven't you ? 
ever since we did that chart with stars . 
what did Mummy buy you in Tesco for being a good boy ? 
well what have we just bought ? 
jelly babies . 
because you've been a special boy „ haven't you ? 
a very good boy . 
a really [/] really good boy ? 
mhm . 
yes . 
I think you've been a really [/] really good boy . 
is the food nice ? 
come on , Purdie . 
if you're going out you must go because we don't want the door open „ do we ? 
going to go outside for a moment ? 
no ? 
is Purdie fed up of outside ? 
she perhaps is , Thomas . 
well we've certainly had a lot of fresh air „ haven't we ? 
mhm . 
having fresh air . 
are we having a party ? 
well that's because we don't normally have sandwiches and crisps at this time of day „ do we ? 
is it like going to a birthday party ? 
actually talking of birthday partys we've got some cards to post . 
we must do that tomorrow . 
we've got one to Michael . 
one to your cousin Tim who is twenty one on Wednesday . 
so we needta write a cheque and put that in the card and send that in the post . 
and then we needta write another one . 
the one that I bought in Tesco tonight . 
we needta write that to <Nick> [//] Uncle_Nick . 
because he was forty on Sunday . 
<we sent him> [//] Daddy sent him a little electronic mail message yesterday „ didn't he ? 
to wish him a happy birthday . 
but Mummy's seeing him on Tuesday night . 
I'm seeing him tomorrow night so I think we needta give him a card . 
it's a special birthday when you're forty . 
mhm . 
Tim ? 
Tim's his name . 
like you're called Thomas . 
<my nephew> [//] your cousin is called Tim . 
and he'll be twenty one on Wednesday . 
pardon ? 
like my mother ? 
Timothy's mother is my sister . 
it's my sister's little boy . 
called Daniel ? 
no . 
we saw Daniel in Tesco „ didn't we ? 
with Julie . 
well Julie means +//. [+ IN] 
the lady's called Julie . 
that's why we call her Julie . 
we say “hello , Julie” . 
+" how are you , Julie . 
+" bye bye , Julie . 
just like people see you and say “hello , Thomas” . 
that lady guessed your name „ didn't she ? 
we were talking to a lady in Tesco and she suddenly said “I can guess your name” . 
+" I bet you're called Thomas . 
now how did she know that ? 
how do you think she knew that ? 
no . 
I don't know . 
she must have heard me say it too you . 
she was a very clever lady „ wasn't she ? 
to guess that . 
and what was the lady buying in Tesco ? 
margarine ? 
was she ? 
I can't remember . 
I didn't see what was in her basket . 
what did she put on the counter though ? 
and you said “what's that” ? 
and she told you and you went and told Becky what it was . 
mhm . 
a [<] pineapple . 
that's right . 
that's right . 
no . 
you said “what's that , Mummy” ? 
and I said “it's a pineapple” . 
and when we finished our shopping we went to meet Jo and you said “look , Becky , there's a pineapple” . 
and that lady was really impressed „ wasn't she ? 
that you (h)ad remembered it was a pineapple . 
can you see the big pink flower blowing in the wind ? 
no . 
you mustn't keep saying “silly woman” . 
and the other windmill's blowing as well . 
the brightly colored one over there . 
and <all the little ones> [//] all the small windmills are going round . 
Mummy reported those „ didn't she ? 
put them in a pot with all those stones . 
can you hear that noise ? 
it's a noise . 
it sounds like somebody might be sawing something . 
cutting something down . 
you [<] think it's a hammer „ do you ? 
no . 
it's not going bang bang bang . 
<it's a> [//] it sounds like an electric saw . 
it sounds like some sort of machine . 
what is it ? 
a what , Thomas ? 
a contatta@c ? 
what's a contatta@c ? 
you do talk a lot of rubbish . 
what are you talking about ? 
you cheeky little boy . 
what are you talking about ? 
contatta@p a@p bashing a wall . 
who's bashing the wall ? 
Fireman_Sam ? 
well he's always bashing something that one „ isn't he ? 
and what about the bin men today ? 
we saw them „ didn't we ? 
no . 
they didn't wave „ did they ? 
it's different men though „ isn't it ? 
the men who collected all the bags together and brought round clean bags for next Monday they always look in and wave at you „ don't they ? 
it's the new men who don't seem to know you here . 
they're flashing at you ? 
I think what you mean is they've got the orange lights on top of the lorry „ haven't they ? 
flashing . 
well I think it's to warn other drivers . 
the dustbin lorry drives a few yards and then it stops „ doesn't it ? 
to pick up all the rubbish and it keeps weaving between one side of the road and the other to pick up bags . 
mhm . 
it does that when it's lifting the bags up into the back . 
but I think the flashing lights are there to warn other people on the road that it's moving slowly . 
and that it might be going from side to side and it'll be stopping . 
they're hazard lights . 
warning lights . 
emergency vehicles like the police the fire brigade and the ambulance all have blue flashing lights „ don't they ? 
but maintenance things like the road sweeper (.) dustbin lorry and breakdown trucks they have orange lights . 
that's the difference . 
no . 
we haven't got any lights on our car „ have we ? 
no . 
and you've no lights on your bicycle . 
xxx bicycle will . [+ PI] 
you'd like that „ wouldn't you ? 
a bell ? 
on the handlebars ? 
so you can go <ding^a^ling^a^ling@o> [/] ding^a^ling^a^ling@o . 
Jo read a story „ didn't she ? 
today . 
about a birthday . 
that's right . 
it was bear's birthday „ wasn't it ? 
and he was very excited because it was his birthday . 
but every house he went to there was nobody there . 
and he rang on people's doorbells ding^a^ling^a^ling@o . 
and he knocked on people's doors rat^a^tat^tat@o . 
he did all those sorts of things and nobody was in . 
and he was ever so disappointed . 
yeah teddy cried . 
he was upset . 
and then he went back home . 
and when he walked in his front door what happened ? 
surprise ! 
a big tortoise . 
that's right . 
the tortoise fetched him „ didn't he ? 
and took him back home . 
and all his friends had laid on a special party . 
and it was a big surprise when he walked through the doors „ wasn't it ? 
he thought everybody had forgotten . 
but the reason people weren't at home when he went to their house was because they were at his house waiting for him to come home so they could say “happy birthday” . 
we went to a birthday party „ didn't we ? 
a couple of weeks ago . 
Charlotte ? 
that was nice „ wasn't it ? 
the dustbin lorry dropped a big huge bag ? 
they did actually drop one today „ didn't they ? 
I think what happened (.) one man threw it so high it completely missed the wagon . 
but then the two men crashed into one another because the driver got out of his cab and ran round the back of the dustbin lorry . 
and the other man round the back didn't know he was there and ran round the corner to pick up the dustbin bag . 
and they bumped into one another „ didn't they ? 
they [<] nearly fell on the road . 
that's right . 
they did . 
we shouldn't laugh really „ should we ? 
you think we should ? 
but they might have hurt themselves . 
they looked a little surprised „ didn't they ? 
I've just got to ring Jo . 
I've just remembered something I must tell Jo . 
it's very important . 
so I'll just give her a quick ring . 
well there's just something I must tell Jo and I forgot to tell her when I saw her before . 
pardon ? 
well because they both ran . 
they both ran in the same direction . 
but one was behind the dustbin lorry so he couldn't see the driver getting out of his cab . 
and because the driver had just jumped out of his cab he couldn't see the other man behind . 
and they bumped into one another „ didn't they ? 
have you just been telling Jo about that on the telephone ? 
because [<] when Mummy spoke to Jo you insisted on having a quick word with her „ didn't you ? 
you needta eat my crisps „ do you ? 
yes . 
well I would like you very much to eat a sandwich please . 
what about a hot cross bun ? 
you needta eat them quickly ? 
just as long as you eat something other than crisps . 
there's some nice cheese on your plate as well . 
ah dear , Thomas . 
I don't know about wearing you out with fresh air . 
I'm absolutely exhausted . 
you can smell sausage ? 
sausage ? 
you can smell sausage coming out of the beans ? 
we haven't got any sausage or beans ? 
oh [<] . 
yes . 
we've got sausage in the freezer and we've got beans in the cupboard . 
but we haven't got any sausages and beans here at the moment „ have we ? 
no . 
Daddy hasn't eaten them all , darling . 
we just haven't got any . 
does that taste good ? 
yes . 
why did the dustbin man fall over ? 
are you enjoying that ? 
pardon ? 
they didn't fall over the lorry , darling . 
they fell over one another „ didn't they ? 
well pretend that's the dustbin lorry and the driver got out of his cab that way and started to run . 
the man behind the dustbin lorry started to run to pick up a bin bag and they went +//. [+ IN] 
oh ! 
piff^paff^poof@o they collided . 
but then they [//] that man threw the bin bag so high it completely missed the back of the rubbish lorry and it landed on the floor . 
do you remember that ? 
yes . 
it nearly touched his flashing light „ didn't it ? 
so those flashing lights should warn motorists that the dustbin lorry's going very slowly . 
and that's weaving from side to side . 
and they might very well be hit on the head with a flying dustbin bag . 
yes ? 
Fred and Rachael had a lot of bin bags outside „ didn't they ? 
yesterday ? 
we only had two „ didn't we ? 
and what was Uncle_Brian doing ? 
what was he doing outside at the front ? 
he was washing his car „ wasn't he ? 
well he was washing Linda's car as well . 
he was washing Linda's car when the dustbin men were here . 
but when we went out for a walk afterwards he was washing his own car . 
and he had the vacuum cleaner inside „ didn't he ? 
because you where shouting “hello , Brian” and he didn't really hear you „ did he ? 
never mind . 
who's going to bite my nose ? 
Thomas_Henry Lastname is going to bite my nose „ <is he> [>] ? 
are you going to eat another sandwich ? 
how comes you always eat the sandwiches that Nana and Granddad buy in Sainsburys ? 
<when I'm at work> [>] +... [+ IN] 
pardon ? 
oh Tesco . 
yes . 
but you don't eat the ones I've made . 
come on . 
it's nice fresh bread . 
nice ham and cheese . 
no ? 
why are you fed up ? 
oh [=! laughs] . 
you're fed up because you've got no more crisps ? 
well you've eaten them all . 
that's why ? 
your hot cross bun is nice though „ isn't it ? 
does that taste good ? 
it's not dirty . 
it's very nice . 
no . 
eat properly at the table , Thomas . 
stop it ! 
Thomas ! 
don't be silly . 
that's not nice „ is it ? 
that's not very nice „ is it ? 
I am looking at you . 
I'm just thinking what a silly boy . 
it's not very nice table manners . 
Thomas ! 
don't . 
you'll make yourself sick eating a meal when you're doing that . 
twisting yourself round „ won't you ? 
yes . 
you see . 
you've gone quiet . 
you've gone a funny color „ haven't you ? 
would you like a yoghurt now ? 
Thomas ! 
what's that ? 
it's not anything ? 
it's an aeroplane ?

what does Harold_the_Helicopter do ? 
what did you say about your holidays and a big huge fish ? 
oh_gosh .

the lid comes off and then there's trouble „ isn't there ? 
there will be trouble .

you're shouting .

would you like a yoghurt now ? 
Thomas ! 
<you don't call me a silly woman> [>] . 
that's naughty . 
no . 
it's not a silly yoghurt either „ is it . 
it's a nice yoghurt . 
no . 
that's not nice saying “silly Mummy eat silly yoghurt” . 
no . 
you'd like your lego train ? 
but would you like a yoghurt , Thomas ? 
Thomas ! 
would you like a yoghurt ? 
yes please ? 
what color would you like ? 
we haven't got blue ones . 
we've got red (.) pink and orange . 
I think . 
I (h)ad better check actually . 
I haven't checked what we've got in the fridge . 
but we don't get blue yoghurt . 
here we are .

I just glanced up and there she was .

more yoghurt to eat ? 
you're making [/] making lots_of slurping sounds „ aren't you ? 
it's being a fence for a big huge fox „ is it ?

do you mean round Auntie_Mabel's chicken shed ? 
to try and keep the fox away from the hens ?

no more jelly babies for little boys who say that . 
who [//] where's the waistcoat ? 
Mister_Sonia ? 
Bella_Lasagne's husband ? 
oh right . 
well the fat controller wears a waistcoat „ doesn't he ? 
in Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
Fireman_Sam's checking under Thomas_The_Tank_Engine ? 
to see if he's alright . 
okay . 
let's just wash your hands now <if you> [>] +... [+ IN] 
mhm . 
everybody (h)as got a huge [/] huge nose .

your huge [/] huge nose is covered in yoghurt „ isn't it ? 
my face is covered in crisps ? 
there we are .

now , Thomas , you're being silly now „ aren't you ? 
she is here . 
she's sitting quietly there .

<she's> [<] minding her own business . 
she's being a good girl . 
she's being a good Purdie „ isn't she ? 
now are you going to be a good boy and help Mummy arrange the flowers that we bought in Tesco earlier on ? 
right . 
right <you telling> [>] +... [+ IN] 
you're having a real little conversation there with Purdie „ aren't you ? 
it sounded at first as if you were telling Purdie we were going to put some flowers in some water . 
but then I'm not quite sure what you went on to say after that . 
now I'm just going to put the bread away while I think about it . 
otherwise it'll dry out and it won't be very nice to eat „ will it ? 
you wanna kiss Purdie ? 
well I must say , Thomas , you've been a much better boy towards Purdie recently . 
you've been a very [/] very clever boy . 
I'm proud of you . 
would you like to have a look at the birthday card we bought this morning ? 
yes . 
you can hold it . 
it says it (h)as got a badge on it . 
oh that does sound like a helicopter „ doesn't it ? 
more like Harold_the_Helicopter ? 
well there's a badge on the front . 
but it isn't like a badge you get on your birthday cards . 
it doesn't play a tune . 
<it says> [//] the badge says “yesterday I was thirty nine” . 
and the card says “cheer up” “being forty isn't all that bad” . 
and it shows a picture of a ginger cat on the wall looking very sad „ doesn't it ? 
little sad cat ? 
and then we open it up and it says “if you were a cat you'd be two hundred and eighty” . 
happy birthday . 
well <Nick> [/] Nick has a cat called Toby_Tuppence . 
his cat's called Toby . 
your pussy cat's called Thomas_Henry Lastname ? 
your pussy cat's called Purdie . 
and she wants to go out . 
look . 
no . 
she doesn't . 
she's just trying to make her mind up . 
right . 
I'll get some flowers . 
well to put in a vase . 
right . 
you threw the card away . 
but it's alright I've got it . 
I've got it quite safe . 
the daffodils are called Di ? 
well they're not daffodils „ are they ? 
they're pink carnations . 
they're quite a deep pink . 
you don't normally get them quite as deep as these . 
that's right . 
well there's some flower food with them . 
so I'm going to just +/. [+ IN] 
you wanna look at the huge [/] huge pot . 
well I'm putting that powder in . 
that special food for the flowers . 
look . 
have a look in there . 
yes ? 
can you see ? 
right . 
now I'll put some water on it . 
fill the vase up . 
do you ? 
well I tell you what . 
there's a big fork . 
can you see now ? 
now put the fork in and give it a quick stir . 
you give it a quick stir . 
that's right . 
to dissolve the powder . 
that's right . 
we'll give it a quicker stir . 
that's it . 
<stir stir> [/] stir . 
mix it up . 
mix it up and make it nice . [+ R] 
pop goes the weasel . [+ R] 
more stir . 
that's right . 
one more stir .

okay . 
good boy . 
one more stir . 
you stir it once more . 
some fish ? 
I don't think there's any fish in there . 
right . 
now <let's cut down the> [//] let's cut the flower stems off . 
oops a daisy . 
Mummy nearly spilt it then „ didn't she ? 
now [<] if we put it there . 
we'll stand it on that cloth . 
and if I cut the bottoms off would you like to arrange them ? 
you'll be a daffodil man . 
our daffodils were in bud yesterday . 
and I noticed when I came home from Tesco yesterday with Jo some of them are in flower „ aren't they ? 
let me just pop one in to check the height . 
yes . 
I think that's alright „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
you can put them in . 
I was just checking that I (h)ad cut enough stem off . 
there you are [>] . 
pardon ? 
nearly pricked you ? 
I don't think there's anything really sharp on carnations . 
but what you must be careful of , Thomas , is when you come in the front door . 
because we've got a big rose bush outside . 
and when we cut it down the thorns on the roses are very [/] very sharp . 
and you could hurt yourself quite badly . 
if you prick yourself with a rose thorn . 
just let me cut a tiny bit more off that . 
there you are , love . 
you're busy ? 
oh I'm Auntie_Mabel again „ am I ? 
I tell you what , Tom . 
I'm going to just chop a tiny bit more off there . 
there you are . 
would you like to pop them back in the water . 
I'm sorry . 
I took them out because I realized they looked a little bit too tall . 
that's it . 
don't touch the flower solution . 
because there's powder in it „ isn't there ? 
you've gone quiet . 
are you concentrating ? 
you concentrating ? 
here you are , love . 
another one . 
oh thank you . 
you're being a good help „ aren't you ? 
there you are . 
now there's just one more . 
one more . 
now aren't they pretty ? 
haven't you done a good job ? 
you really have , Thomas . 
that's beautiful . 
now we've got some leaves here . 
shall we put the leaves in ? 
yes . 
you do it . 
certainly , darling . 
you do it by all means . 
yeah . 
&-uh hm: . 
there we are . 
another leaf . 
let's put that there . 
you needta be a palm tree ? 
<there we are> [>] . 
no [<] just +//. [+ IN] 
no . 
don't pop that in yet , darling . 
no . 
we've not trimmed it . 
there you are . 
we needta just trim the ends off the stalks „ don't we ? 
what are you saying now ? 
are you talking gobbledygook again ? 
now they look nice „ don't they ? 
no . 
we don't put that in . 
that's a little bit of the stalk we've cut off . 
it's a leaf . 
is it a leaf ? 
a daffodil ? 
no . 
there's no daffodils in these flowers , Thomas . 
I think that looks very nice . 
you're a good boy , Thomas . 
you're a clever boy . 
don't put it on the floor . 
by gum . 
<we do good work> [<] . 
we did good work . 
and you helped Mummy when you put it on the floor . 
right . 
you going to pick all these leaves up ? 
and bits of stalk and put it into the paper ? 
please . 
and then we can throw it all away together „ can't we ? 
we've missed the dustbin collection today „ haven't we ? 
but the flower stalks can actually go into the compost bin outside „ can't they ? 
and the leaves . 
it's just the plastic wrapping and <the food> [//] <the plant food> [//] the flower food wrapper that we've got to put in the bin . 
thank you . 
good boy . 
let's just wipe the table . 
and I think we could do with wiping your hands again . 
<couldn't we> [>] ? 
you wanna give Purdie lots_of kiss ? 
<you wanna give her> [<] a big cuddle as well ? 
that's nice . 
you wanna cuddle her tummy ? 
that sounds nice . 
you've certainly been a good boy to Purdie . 
and I'm very proud of you , Thomas . 
it's much nicer when you're good to Purdie „ isn't it ? 
and kind to her . 
don't you think ? 
and it (h)as been lovely having all these little rewards . 
there you are . 
good boy . 
thank you , Misses_Der_Der_Der@c ? 
oh you're giving me a lovely cuddle now . 
isn't that nice ? 
xxx [>] . 
<you're kissing> [<] my tummy button ? 
let me kiss you . 
oh . 
oh I'm not kissing that . 
by gum . 
no . 
certainly not . 
I don't +//. [+ IN] 
I don't think we wanna do that . 
do you know what Thomas_The_Tank_Engine's driver would say ? 
I don't like that at all . 
you were asking to play with your lego train before „ weren't you ? 
would you still like to ? 
on the table ? 
okay . 
what does Milo say ? 
silly_billy@wp ? 
sooly_booly@wp ? 
oh , Thomas . 
I give up with you . 
I don't know what you're saying half the time . 
oh [?] . 
hello , puss . 
Purdie's crying now „ isn't she ? 
well she's meowing . 
perhaps she wants feeding . 
let's just find a plate for you , pussy cat . 
there we are . 
there's Purdie's special plate . 
we bought some more food in Tesco for Purdie today „ didn't we ? 
xxx [>] . 
Auntie_Mabel <&sa> [//] would like another cup of tea ? 
I would quite like a cup of tea , Thomas . 
oh sorry . 
<are you> [<] [/] are you a fireman or are you an engine driver ? 
oh right . 
I was just thinking you (h)ad asked for you wooden train so I thought perhaps you were a train driver . 
I'm not really warm „ are you ? 
&-uh (.) I beg your pardon [>] ? 
you want some little biscuits like Purdie's ? 
you can't eat biscuits like Purdie's „ can you ? 
you've just this minute finished your meal . 
don't you ? 
no . 
no [/] no . 
we can't put Purdie's biscuits in the bowl . 
<no no> [/] no . 
goodness me . 
you wanna put some biscuits in Purdie's bowl ? 
you wanna put some biscuits in the bowl so the pussy cats eat them all up ? 
you're going back to last week when you were looking after Ginger_Furball and Gingells and +... [+ IN] 
+, Jess . 
the three pussy cats . 
&=laughs . 
okay . 
okay . 
you've got me ? 
you're cuddling me „ aren't you ? 
ah [<] . 
look . 
there's another pussy cat outside . 
but not a real pussy cat . 
can you see the black cat ? 
it's standing on the water . 
yes . 
well the black cat is perched on top of the flower tub with soil in it . 
and for some reason it (h)as flooded „ hasn't it ? 
there's water standing on top . 
yes . 
<well there's &wat> [<] +... [+ IN] 
there's a lot of water on the patio because a certain young man called Thomas_Henry Lastname was tipping the water on the patio „ wasn't he ? 
no ? 
how dare you say no@q . 
it's raining ? 
Thomas Lastname it is not raining outside . 
but somebody had a watering can and a tub of water . 
and what was he doing ? 
you were watering everything in sight „ weren't you ? 
you were pretending to be Fireman_Sam putting out fires . 
and then you were a window cleaner man . 
and then you were washing your fire engine . 
you're a messpot . 
<that's what you are> [>] . 
you were washing the path ? 
you were washing everything I think . 
but that pussy cat there is a metal pussy cat . 
and it (h)as got glass eyes . 
and it's sposta scare off other pussy cats . 
and we bought it because last year the big ginger cat . 
Ginger_Battersby wasn't very nice to Purdie . 
he kept upsetting her „ didn't he ? 
by coming in the garden . 
and we thought +//. [+ IN] 
oh it is raining now . 
very [/] very fine rain . 
can you see it ? 
and we thought if we stood it in the garden we could scare him off and stop him coming in . 
but it didn't „ did it ? 
what shall we call it ? 
we've not really given the black cat a name „ have we ? 
no . 
what shall we call the black cat in the garden ? 
hm: . 
we can't have two Purdies in one family , Thomas . 
otherwise I'd be calling “Purdie [/] Purdie” and they'd both come in . 
how about Sooty ? 
Sooty's a dog . 
Jo and Becky's dog's called Sooty „ isn't he ? 
well what else could we call him ? 
you think of a nice name and we'll call that pussy cat whatever you want . 
Ginger ? 
we can't call a black cat Ginger . 
because we call the ginger cat Ginger . 
we'd get even more confused „ won't we ? 
I'll shout “Purdie [/] Purdie” and we'll get two Purdies running towards us . 
and then we'd go out and shout “Ginger [/] Ginger” and we'd have two ginger cats running . 
only one would be ginger . 
one would be black . 
think of a different name , Thomas . 
Felix ? 
well no . 
because Uncle_Brian's pussy cat's called Felix . 
and we'd shout “Felix [/] Felix” and we'd have Felix (.) black and white Felix from next door . 
and we'd have the black Felix from our garden . 
think again . 
Sooty a^burb^a^burb@c ? 
no . 
I'm not standing on the doorstep shouting “Sooty a^burb^a^burb@c dinner time” . 
shall we call him Henry ? 
oh because <you're Henry> [>] . 
am I ? 
oh , Thomas . 
that's not nice . 
you dropped your train on the floor ? 
well I'll leave you to think of a suitable name for the pussy cat . 
shall we call him Puss ? 
we could just call him Puss „ couldn't we ?
