we'll read that book in a minute , Thomas . 
I just wanna dry this . 
this is a glass storage jar that we keep sugar in . 
and we've run out of sugar . 
that's right . 
yes . 
Granddad has it in his coffee „ doesn't he ? 
we don't have sugar in our drinks . 
but Granddad likes a spoonful in his coffee . 
and Granddad's coming tomorrow . 
so I've washed the <storage jar> [>] . 
oh yes . 
is that your book ? 
has he spilt the juice ? 
we'll read that in a moment . 
there we are . 
we'll leave that to dry . 
and when it's dry properly . 
we'll put some sugar in there . 
Nana and Granddad a spoon ? 
does he have a spoon of sugar ? 
he stirs <the sugar> [>] in his coffee ? 
no . 
he doesn't have it in tea . 
I think it's just in coffee . 
and then does he use a spoon to stir it up ? 
well shall we sit in that chair ? 
and we'll read this book . 
if we sit in this chair . 
<and we're> [>] facing the window . 
if anything very exciting happens when we're reading . 
we can leap up quick „ can't we ? 
Tom and Pippo . 
that's right . 
this book's about a little boy called Tom . 
like you . 
his real name's probably Thomas . 
but he's called Tom . 
and he (h)as got a toy monkey „ hasn't he ? 
and what's the monkey called ? 
yeah . 
but what's the monkey called ? 
Pippo . 
that's right . 
so we'll read these storys . 
yellow . 
that's right . 
the first page is yellow „ isn't it ? 
and this one's green . 
and it's called Tom and Pippo's day . 
when I wake up early in the morning first I give Pippo a hug . [+ R] 
yes he (h)as got his juice . 
then we go to see if Mummy and Daddy are awake . [+ R] 
Daddy hasta hurry with his breakfast . [+ R] 
sometimes I give Pippo some of mine . [+ R] 
but he's so clumsy and he makes a mess . [+ R] 
what (h)as happened there ? 
the juice has been spilt „ hasn't it ? 
we can see the cup upturned and the <juice running down the table> [>] . 
Thomas do it ? 
yes . 
you do that sometimes with your juice „ don't you ? 
Pippo and I do things together all day . [+ R] 
until Daddy comes home . [+ R] 
when it's bedtime I sometimes don't know where Pippo is . [+ R] 
and I hafta look everywhere until I find him . [+ R] 
because when it's time to go to sleep . [+ R] 
I needta be with Pippo . [+ R] 
ah look . 
they're asleep in bed . 
and he's cuddling Pippo . 
who does Thomas have in his cot ? 
you have Jess the cat . 
and who else ? 
a big bear . 
you've got Daddy's blue teddy bear „ haven't you ? 
and your teddy bear sits at the bottom of the cot . 
but who else ? 
Thomas . 
yes . 
you're in the cot . 
but there's somebody very special who you can't go to sleep without . 
she's red . 
who is she ? 
no . 
who is she ? 
yes . 
she's red . 
but who's your special friend ? 
how about Po ? 
Po . 
Po goes to bed with Thomas „ doesn't she ? 
now this one's called Tom and Pippo in the washing machine . 
look . 
that looks like us „ doesn't it ? 
Cornflakes ? 
no . 
I think it's a packet of washing powder . 
looks like Cornflakes „ doesn't it ? 
but I think it's a box of washing powder . 
Mummy uses little tablets or liquid . 
so you haven't seen a box like that . 
one day Pippo played in the mud and get really dirty . [+ R] 
Mummy said we would hafta put him in the machine . [+ R] 
with the washing . [+ R] 
I said goodbye to Pippo . [+ R] 
because I thought he might never come out of the machine . [+ R] 
poor Pippo went round and round . [+ R] 
I hope she didn't feel sick . 
when Pippo came out of the machine he was really wet . [+ R] 
will Pippo ever get dry I asked Mummy . [+ R] 
Mummy said he'd soon be dry if he went on the line with the washing . [+ R] 
Pippo . 
can you see Pippo hanging on the line ? 
and who's that in the garden ? 
a pussy cat . 
yes . 
the Mummy's bending over . 
getting the washing out of the basket . 
Tom's looking at Pippo drying on the line . 
and there's a pussy cat looking up as well . 
I told Pippo he'd be dry by bedtime if the sun came out . [+ R] 
and the wind kept blowing . [+ R] 
the trouble is I know Pippo's going to get dirty again . [+ R] 
I can't stop him playing in muddy places . [+ R] 
oh sounds like you . 
you . 
you . 
Thomas Henry . 
oh now this one's called Tom and Pippo make a mess . 
when Daddy is at home I watch the way he does things . [+ R] 
and I try to do the same . [+ R] 
that's Tom's Daddy look . 
Daddy Rod ? 
you think his Daddy's called Rod ? 
like Isabelle's Daddy ? 
Mummy's called Sonia . 
okay . 
so in this book shall we say the Mummy's called Sonia ? 
and the Daddy's called Rod ? 
when Daddy writes a letter I go and get my pen and write a letter too . [+ R] 
when Daddy shaves I pretend I'm shaving . [+ R] 
Pippo thinks I shouldn't waste the shaving cream . [+ R] 
one day Daddy was doing some painting . [+ R] 
while he was out of the room I did some painting to help him . [+ R] 
Daddy said I had made a mess and was cross . [+ R] 
anyway it was Pippo who said we should help Daddy . [+ R] 
and I hadta be cross with him . [+ R] 
Mummy cross . 
yes . 
Mummy gets cross quite easily „ doesn't she ? 
what does Mummy get cross about ? 
yes ! 
Mummy gets absolutely furious about you brushing the trees outside . 
you don't really brush them . 
you just pull the leaves off . 
but Mummy goes absolutely potty when you do that „ doesn't she ? 
what [/] what +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
you're more than cheeky . 
what else do I get cross about , Thomas ? 
oh you're giving me a kiss . 
pardon ? 
what else do I get cross about ? 
you splashing (.) in the bath ? 
and what else ? 
throwing . 
I don't like you throwing . 
because what (h)as happened today ? 
we hadta get the vacuum cleaner out „ didn't we ? 
because +/. [+ IN] 
you were sitting in your chair . 
at the table . 
and you said you were feeding the ducks . 
and started throwing all your food on the floor . 
but since when , Thomas , have we had quack^quacks@c on our dining room floor ? 
yes . 
precisely we haven't „ have we ? 
so you made a mess . 
and was Mummy cross ? 
and what does Mummy say when she's cross ? 
yes . 
and do I say naughty@q ? 
and do I say “oh that's silly” ? 
mhm . 
<so what else> [>] . 
<we haven't finished this story> [>] . 
oh yes . 
the blue balloon . 
it's losing it's air . 
it's going down . 
here we are . 
I'm going to finish this story now . 
Daddy said he's going to work in the garden tomorrow . [+ R] 
I hope he wants me to help . [+ R] 
Dadda help . 
now this is a story about Pippo getting lost . 
it says “Pippo gets lost” . 
there you are . 
&=laughs . 
you've sneaked to the back and then you've found him . 
sometimes Pippo gets lost and I hafta look for him . [+ R] 
&=laughs . 
is that what you shout ? 
Pippo ! 
where are you ? 
I ask Mummy if she (h)ad seen Pippo . [+ R] 
and she said I should look again in the toy box . [+ R] 
Pippo wasn't there . [+ R] 
but I found his scarf . [+ R] 
Dadda said “have you looked under your bed” ? [+ R] 
but all I found there was Pippo's hat . [+ R] 
I got really worried about Pippo . [+ R] 
and thought I might never see him again . [+ R] 
Thomas , you're stabbing on my head . 
Mummy's going to get cross . 
no . 
Mummy cross . 
Mummy said Pippo couldn't be far away . [+ R] 
and we should look for him in the sitting room . [+ R] 
and that's where he (h)ad been all the time . [+ R] 
in the bookcase . [+ R] 
if Pippo is going off on his own I told him <he really should let me know> [>] . [+ R] 
oh has Mark come back ? 
has Mark come back from work ? 
is his car there ? 
oh you see I told you . 
if we sat in this chair we could keep an eye on what was going on . 
we've got to keep up our reputation of being nosy neighbors , Thomas „ haven't we ? 
none of the neighbors think we're nosy . 
but everyone listening to this tape thinks we are . 
that's +/. [+ IN] 
that's Sam's Mummy . 
Sam's Mummy (h)as gone in the house . 
who's going now ? 
is Mark going now ? 
has he got in his car ? 
don't know . 
is Sue's car not there ? 
you can see more than me . 
because you're standing up . 
I'm sitting down . 
oh now this is one called “Tom and Pippo read a story” . 
this is like Tom and Mummy reading a story now . 
I like to look at books . [+ R] 
but best of all I like to look at books with Daddy . [+ R] 
Daddy likes to look at his paper . [+ R] 
but he doesn't mind reading my books with me . [+ R] 
Mummy's books . 
Daddy's books . 
when Daddy (h)as finished reading to me . [+ R] 
I think Pippo would like to hear a story . [+ R] 
so I bring Pippo and ask Daddy to read to him . [+ R] 
when Daddy says he really can't read anymore books . [+ R] 
I read to Pippo . [+ R] 
I hope one day Pippo can read on his own . [+ R] 
you know this story „ don't you ? 
this is the last one in the book . 
and it's called “Tom and Pippo see the moon” . 
when does the moon come out , Thomas ? 
when it's dark ? 
yeah . 
yes . [+ SR] 
shining the moon ? 
the sun stops shining and the moon comes out „ doesn't it ? 
and what about stars ? 
in the sky ? 
one night when it was dark I saw the moon shining in the sky . [+ R] 
that's right . 
Tom's sitting on his potty . 
looking out of the window . 
watching the moon „ isn't he ? 
when are you going to sit on your potty ? 
when you brush your teeth ? 
you usually sit on your potty after you've brushed your teeth „ don't you ? 
I asked Daddy all about the moon . [+ R] 
Daddy told me a man had been on the moon . [+ R] 
and he hadta get there in a rocket . [+ R] 
I asked Daddy if there was anyone on the moon now . [+ R] 
and Daddy said no . [+ R] 
I think Pippo and I will go to the moon one day . [+ R] 
we will go in a rocket . [+ R] 
I asked Daddy if Pippo and I could go to the moon . [+ R] 
and Daddy said maybe . [+ R] 
but the moon's very far away . [+ R] 
maybe . 
perhaps . 
if Pippo and I go to the moon one day I think Daddy should come as well . [+ R] 
anyway tonight I think we shall just go to sleep . [+ R] 
perhaps we will go to the moon tomorrow . [+ R] 
well that's a nice book „ isn't it ? 
on the back page it says Pippo is Tom's special friend . 
and the two of them do everything together . 
they read a story . 
and make a mess . 
and see the moon . 
it's fun being at home with Tom and Pippo . 
we have another book „ don't we ? 
about the same people . 
called “out and about with Tom and Pippo” . 
and that time Tom seems to do more things with his Mummy „ doesn't he ? 
I can't think what now . 
but I think +//. [+ IN] 
don't they take the dog for a walk ? 
and the doggy gets messy ? 
and they hafta bathe the dog when they get home ? 
and I can't think what else they do . 
perhaps we'll read that book another day . 
but this one's called at home with Tom and Pippo . 
by Helen Oxbury . 
we could write one about Thomas Henry and Po . 
couldn't we ? 
Thomas Henry . 
Thomas Henry . 
are your shorts coming down ? 
oh don't . 
you'll pop the balloon , Thomas . 
are you going to pull your shorts up ? 
Mummy do it ? 
you hafta come here then if you want your shorts pulling up . 
oh look . 
you see . 
you've missed somebody . 
there's a lady and we don't know who she is . 
oh dear . 
mhm . 
I can hear Linda . 
but that wasn't Linda walking past . 
that was an older lady „ wasn't it ? 
Linda one ? 
you playing with your car ? 
what's up in the air ? 
oh the digger's up in the air . 
oh I see . 
you're playing with your digger . 
and you've got the red car +/. [+ IN] 
+, in the bucket „ haven't you ? 
<dig dig> [/] dig . 
you sound like you're in the boy scouts , Thomas . 
<dib@n dib@n> [/] dib@n . 
<dob dob> [/] dob@n . 
oh . 
gobble [/] gobble . 
you're talking about turkey now „ aren't you ? 
what do we say ? 
the turkey is a funny bird . [+ R] 
it's head goes bobble bobble . [+ R] 
and all it knows is just one word . [+ R] 
and that is +... [+ IN] 
+, gobble [/] gobble ! 
that's right . 
now I said you sounded like you were in the boy scouts because you were saying <dig dig> [/] dig . 
and boy scouts say <dig dib@n> [/] dib@n . 
<dob dob> [/] dob@n . 
apparently . 
oh this lady's coming back now , Thomas . 
she can't have been very far „ can she ? 
I'll let you look out of the window at her . 
because she might think I'm nosy . 
&=laughs . 
and that's why I've got such a big nose , Thomas . 
because I keep &-uh (.) poking it into other people's business . 
what my darling ? 
digger and down ? 
are you going to watch me put the sugar in this container ? 
not that's terribly exciting to watch . 
look sugar comes in a paper bag like this . 
can you hear it rattling ? 
can you hear it ? 
it's going in there . 
yes . 
just leave that there . 
that's right . 
we put that on . 
that's a rubber seal round the rim of the jar . 
that's right . 
so when the lid's shut it keeps the air out . 
sugar hasta be kept dry . 
otherwise it goes all funny . 
which reminds me . 
we've got to fill the salt pot up as well . 
yes . 
spoon . 
yes . 
Granddad likes salt as well as sugar . 
tell Granddad he likes everything that's bad for him . 
<will you tell him that> [<] ? 
so later on we'll wash the salt pot and leave it to dry . 
and then we'll fill it with salt . 
alright . 
what color do you think sugar is ? 
white ! 
there . 
can you see it ? 
it looks like snow „ doesn't it ? 
oh we didn't need the spoon „ did we ? 
because the bag wasn't full . 
and we could just pour out what there was straight into the storage jar . 
and look what's on the back . 
a yellow and a red cup . 
it's showing a yellow and a red cup on a saucer . 
and I think they must be really hot drinks . 
because can you see the steam coming off ? 
well I'll shut the lid . 
would you like to put the empty sugar packet in the bin please ? 
that's right . 
now let's [/] let's just have a look at this „ shall we ? 
oh it's sometimes easier to sweep it up then wipe it up „ isn't it ? 
there look . 
this is a special jar . 
you push the lid down . 
and put that wire clip over there like that . 
and then you press down on that . 
oh ! 
that's it . 
all tight now . 
the sugar can't get out . 
and it'll keep nice and dry . 
<there we are> [>] . 
when you get to that tub there tomorrow . 
when <Granddad> [>] comes and wants his cup of coffee . 
you can tell him can't you ? 
that you've got +//. [+ IN] 
we filled <a sugar pot for him> [>] . 
oh no . 
you can't play with it . 
you can see it „ can't you ? 
when you see that jar up there now you'll always remember that you helped put the sugar in the jar . 
we've got some other things „ haven't we ? 
storage things . 
look at these . 
look at these white boxes . 
showing a loaf of bread . 
pardon ? 
two lids please ? 
oh be careful . 
there we are . 
we'll take the labels off these . 
and then we'll hafta wash them later before we can put any food in „ won't we ? 
oh they drive me mad when they put these sticky labels on that don't come off . 
the ones (.) on the side of the boxes +/. [+ IN] 
thank you , darling . 
the ones on the side of the boxes +//. [+ IN] 
oh there's the bus look . 
xxx [>] . 
well that's a special sort of bus , Thomas , because there's a little boy who lives round the corner whose legs don't work quite as well as yours . 
yes . 
and you know how you sit in your pushchair ? 
when you're feeling a bit tired +//. [+ IN] 
when your legs are feeling a bit tired and you don't wanna walk you sit in your pushchair „ don't you ? 
well that little boy has poorly legs . 
and his legs feel tired most of the time . 
so he hasta sit in +//. [+ IN] 
it's like a pushchair but it's called a wheelchair . 
and he goes to school every day . 
even in the holidays in that bus . 
it comes and collects him . 
it's a special bus . 
it's a special bus . 
you know how we can wheel our pushchair onto a bus ? 
well that special bus comes and picks him up . 
and wheels his wheelchair . 
and we see it every morning and every afternoon „ don't we ? 
that's right . 
you help rip these labels off . 
the big labels comes off really easy „ doesn't it ? 
it's these horrible sticky labels on the bottom . 
oh that one's coming off better . 
look at that . 
oh ! 
it nearly all came off that one „ didn't it ? 
a big pop ? 
well I'll put these in the kitchen . 
we'll leave them to soak . 
and then we can put some in the xxx . [+ PI] 
look . 
what have we got here ? 
let's have a look at this one . 
this isn't a plastic box „ is it ? 
Thomas [>] +/. [+ IN] 
oh . 
what's this ? 
what is this , Thomas ? 
it's a box . 
a cardboard box . 
and inside it (h)as got some bookends . 
there we are . 
a pair of bookends . 
two bookends . 
and they're quite heavy „ aren't they ? 
they're black wire mesh . 
oh they're a bit trendy for us though . 
xxx gosh trendy ! [+ PI] 
Thomas and Mummy have gone trendy . 
oh we'll put one upstairs on the landing . 
because your books stand on the dresser at the moment . 
and some of them lean against the wall . 
and the others keep falling over . 
so we'll put that [>] at the end . 
oh you've got a sticky label stuck to your shorts , Thomas . 
and the other one +//. [+ IN] 
oh be careful . 
I shall put in the kitchen . 
to hold the cookery books in place on the shelf . 
yes . 
oh that's nice isn't it , Thomas ? 
look at that . 
that's very smart . 
and usually you have +//. [+ IN] 
you need two bookends +//. [+ IN] 
a pair of bookends . 
two ones . 
a pair . 
but seeing as our books are leaning on a wall at one side you can get away with just using one of the xxx . [+ PI] 
and what else have we got here ? 
and we've come back with all sorts of things . 
yes . 
this is something else covered in sticky labels . 
what's that for ? 
now this is a magazine file . 
now be careful , Thomas , with that . 
because it'll hurt your fingers . 
no . 
right . 
you're going to really hurt your finger now . 
this is what you do with this +/. [+ IN] 
what got here ? 
oh you're going to xxx in it „ are you ? 
oh I see . 
well that's upstairs in your bedroom . 
we've got a blue plastic storage box that we keep all your books in . 
but we wanted another one for things like jigsaw puzzles . 
so I bought a matching one today . 
and it is . 
it's big enough for you to sit in „ isn't it ? 
this is for Daddy . 
can you see that ? 
it's a magazine rack . 
now can you see these magazines ? 
they're standing there like that . 
oh that's smart „ isn't it ? 
instead of them falling all over the place . 
thank you . 
the shop . 
yes . 
we go to the shop to buy magazines „ don't we ? 
most of the newspapers come through the door though . 
the boy delivers them . 
or the girl . 
Lisa comes „ doesn't she ? 
but these magazines we buy in the shop . 
are you falling over the beanbag , Thomas ? 
rubbish ? 
bin bags ? 
yes . 
well on Tuesday mornings +//. [+ IN] 
it didn't happen this week . 
it's next week . 
but all the newspapers and magazines that we've finished with we put in a white bag „ don't we ? 
like a bin bag . 
but it's white . 
and we put it outside . 
and the paper recycling people come and collect it „ don't they ? 
yes . 
rubbish . 
and they tip it into that truck „ don't they ? 
this is something else with a sticky label on it , Thomas . 
are you a bit tired now ? 
bang^a^drum@c ? 
oh I see . 
you're running your fingers over the mesh bookcase pretending it's a musical instrument „ aren't you ? 
I'll just take the labels off these boxes that we're using for your jigsaws . 
are you going to sing while you're doing that ? 
this label's coming off easily look . 
oh ! 
pop . 
so that can go upstairs „ can't it ? 
there's some more labels on the lid . 
the sun's shining now . 
backside ? 
it says important notice . 
do not sit or stand on this product . 
ha^ha@o ? 
can you remember that ? 
can you remember that , Thomas , not to sit or stand on it ? 
yes . 
I bet you can't . 
right . 
I'm putting that in there now . 
because all these things needta go upstairs when we next go „ don't they ? 
and we've got xxx [>] +/. [+ IN] 
that's a jigsaw . 
yes . 
I'll get it for you . 
just a moment . 
and we've got a ring binder „ haven't we ? 
so that when Dimitra starts bringing all your utterances typed up we can put them straight into there . 
because at the moment we've just got them lying around . 
they're going to get messed up „ aren't they ?

but don't lift out . 
the bee bah is driving off ? 
are you playing with the fire engine on the floor ? 
you're driving off . 
now Mummy (h)as still got one box to unwrap „ hasn't she ? 
well one's a green bus . 
and one's a yellow minibus . 
I can't see , Thomas . 
you'll hafta put it down .

I hadn't thought of that . 
oh be careful , Thomas .

be careful . 
it's not a toy .

not a toy . 
but I certainly hadn't thought of that . 
oh look .

could you pass me that piece of paper please . 
that's a rubber band .

and what did she hafta say to you ? 
oh . 
sounds interesting . 
I don't think we really need that leaflet . 
do we now ? 
it's keeping you amused „ isn't it ? 
that's right .

so that these +//. [+ IN]

they hafta hook on there . 
look . 
you're concentrating so much on what you're doing that you're not talking „ are you ?

you're not being gentle , Thomas . 
don't just throw them down there like that . 
wrong way round .

whoops a daisy . 
are you alright ?

I thought it was you that came crashing through . 
goodness me . 
you bumped yourself ? 
you're alright „ aren't you ? 
crash . 
actually that lid on that box , Thomas , that I said had some scratches on it is actually xxx on one side „ isn't it ? [+ PI] 
which isn't really very good . 
oh ! 
that little red car moves on it's own „ doesn't it ? 
what're you saying about the digger ?

you missed that , Thomas . 
the red car hasn't got a driver „ has it ? 
but the digger has a little man wearing a yellow helmet . 
a hard hat . 
and the racing car has a man wearing a red crash helmet . 
the man in the digger needs a hard hat because he works on a building site like Bob_The_Builder . 
and if something [<] heavy falls on his head . 
it could hurt without his hat . 
and the racing car needs a helmet . 
because he drives very [/] very quickly .

you could have some milk . 
and Mummy might have a drink . 
and then we can go for a walk .

what's the matter ? 
did you nearly trap your fingers ? 
and shall we have pasta for tea tonight ? 
Thomas's favorite . 
you've not really eaten a lot of food „ have you ? 
since the weekend . 
I think you (h)ad better be a bit careful playing with that , Thomas . 
don't trap your fingers . 
no trap fingers . 
it would hurt „ wouldn't it ? 
there we are . 
that's all the washing folded up . 
it's dry . 
and then Mummy (h)as got to iron it . 
unless you're going to iron it for me „ are you ? 
would you like to do that ? 
yes ? 
oh now steady , Thomas .

I should say the straps of your drum are caught around the clothesline . 
the sun's shining now .

yes . 
when it's lying flat on it's side . 
it looks like a ladder „ doesn't it ? 
are you climbing up the steps ? 
as long as you don't try and climb on it when it's upright . 
oh no [/] no . 
it'll collapse . 
no . 
right . 
that's enough now . 
can't keep dropping it , Thomas . 
it'll break . 
well you hold it . 
but if you throw it again it's going away . 
yes ? 
if you're putting it down gently . 
apart from not wanting it to break . 
it's going to trap you . 
what's Brian doing ? 
I don't know . 
but I can hear him sawing some wood . 
what do you think he's making ? 
he (h)as been doing some work in his kitchen „ hasn't he ? 
kitchen cupboards . 
can you see him ? 
can you really ? 
oh , Thomas . 
no . 
you're not to climb up on the table . 
no . 
you can't see him from there . 
you're too small . 
no . 
you <can't> [>] see . 
no . 
we can just hear him „ can't we ? 
where's Purdie ?

you don't want the new box in your cupboard . 
that's fine .

well if you don't want it I don't think I need it for any reason . 
I think we'll break it down . 
put it in the bin „ shall we ?

Thomas making a mess with all these boxes ? 
in his cupboard ? 
oh dear [/] dear . 
that's not a bad mess though „ is it ? 
because you're just pulling them out of the cupboard and putting them on the floor . 
we can easily pick them up . 
we've got a lot of things in this cupboard „ haven't we ? 
oh it's empty now . 
are you going inside ? 
shut a cupboard door ? 
it's dark „ isn't it ? 
well if you sit inside the cupboard and shut the door it's very dark .

I'll bring Po to you .

oh that's not very nice . 
I thought you were going in the cupboard with Po . 
I didn't think +/. [+ IN] 
if I was thinking you were just throwing Po in the cupboard and shuting the door .
