we've had a busy week , darling , driving around the place . 
lots_of journeys here and there . 
it's not easy „ is it ? 
you should be useta being busy though , Postman_Pat . 
because it's not long since we've had Christmas . 
and you were a very busy postman at Christmas „ weren't you ? 
I'm having a few problems with these microphones today . 
because when Mummy listened to the tape +/. [+ IN] 
I don't know why , darling . 
I'm a little bit worried about it . 
would you like some Rice_Krispies or some Cornflakes ?

I haven't got any little biscuits , darling . 
I'm terribly sorry . 
I haven't got any , love . 
I'm sorry . 
no [<] I haven't . 
I promise you I haven't got anything . 
I honestly haven't . 
Grandma had some little biscuits . 
but Mummy hasn't . 
Grandma hasn't sent any back with you „ has she ? 
I'm terribly sorry , love , I haven't got any biscuits . 
can you hear that aeroplane ? 
did you ? 
you're making up silly words today „ aren't you ? 
oh look . 
Mummy's going to have a nice big bowl of Cornflakes . 
I think I'll have some milk on it . 
some milk on there I should say . 
would you like some milk on your Rice_Krispies ? 
we can hear them go snap@o crackle@o and pop@o then „ can't we ? 
don't you ? 
okay [<] . 
alright . 
well I'm going to put some milk on my Cornflakes (.) but Cornflakes don't sound the same „ do they ? 
you're Bob_the_Builder now „ are you „ having your breakfast ? 
lots_of cement „ is it ? 
is [<] that what the Rice_Krispies are ? 
a bowl full of Rice_Krispies looks [>] like a lot of cement ? 
<it taste> [>] +... [+ IN] 
it tastes like cement ? 
it's lovely ? 
I've never tasted cement , Thomas . 
I wouldn't know . 
I would imagine it would make your teeth stick together . 
Rice_Krispies won't but cement would . 
if you're eating cement . 
it's nice „ isn't it ? 
I thought you must have been hungry really because you've been a busy boy . 
you were a busy postman . 
yes . 
and you've watched Auntie_Mabel „ haven't you ? 
they were having a conversation . 
and she was actually with the hens outside with Pippin when she heard the telephone ringing . 
so she ran inside quickly to answer the telephone . 
and it was her sister and they got talking . 
but she (h)ad gone into the house so quickly she (h)ad forgotten to close the gate . 
and Pippin could see that a fox was getting nearer and nearer and nearer and he was frightened . 
because if a fox gets into the hen house +/. [+ IN] 
she did . 
because <if her> [//] if a fox gets into her hen house +//. [+ IN] 
oh it's terrible , Thomas . 
because the fox really upsets the hens . 
well the fox is hungry . 
and sometimes he likes to eat the hens . 
so Pippin went to get Auntie_Mabel . 
and he was tugging at her skirt trying to tell her there was something wrong . 
you remember like the episode where Auntie_Mabel was stuck in the cupboard when her chip pan was on fire ? 
and Pippin rushed to the fireman „ didn't he ? 
and he barked <and barked> [/] and barked until the fireman realized there was something wrong . 
well he did the same on today's program with Auntie_Mabel . 
he tugged <and tugged> [/] and tugged at her skirt until she realized that he wasn't playing . 
I keep saying he . 
Pippin's actually a girl . 
she realized that Pippin wasn't playing and that there was something wrong . 
and she went running out after Pippin and she could see the fox . 
and she went shoo^shoo@o . 
and the fox got away . 
and then her hens were safe . 
her eggs were safe . 
and Pippin was safe (.) everyone was safe . 
and then do you know what they were going to have for their tea ? 
what were they going to have ? 
eggs . 
did she ? 
did she give Pippin some egg ? 
<in his> [//] in her bowl ? 
well you don't like egg sandwiches . 
oh . 
but perhaps we should try you with something else . 
because the last time I tried you <with a boil> [//] with a boiled egg and scrambled egg you didn't like it . 
but that was quite a few months ago . 
I might try again . 
tell you what I really +//. [+ IN] 
oh steady .

today might be a little bit difficult . 
what do you mean you need the numbers on the trailer , love ? 
some numbers ? 
I'm not sure what you mean , sweetheart . 
I'm sorry . 
<oh I know> [<] [//] I know what you mean . 
but you're not having sweeties . 
no . 
you're referring to the little sweets called Skittles . 
they come in a red packet and taste very much like Opal_Fruits . 
they're very tiny and round . 
and have letters [/] letters of the alphabet stamped on them . 
and when I gave you some last week as a treat you poured +//. [+ IN] 
well it was earlier this week (.) you poured some in the back of the trailer „ didn't you ? 
but no you can't have sweeties all the time , Thomas . 
no [/] no . 
no . 
it's breakfast time . 
and you said <you weren't hungry> [>] . 
it's breakfast . 
that's why you're having Rice_Krispies and I'm having Cornflakes . 
<cheeky monkey> [<] . 
so the eggs we buy in the shop (.) we can cook and eat „ can't we ? 
but what sort of eggs did we see this morning on the television ? 
you're pushing it ? 
you're pushing the blue bowl with your red spoon „ are you ? 
you [<] pretending to be a noisy train now ? 
you're being a whistle man ?

did you go to Mike's the butcher ? 
did you go to the butcher ? 
you know the butcher we go to ? 
the man that's called Mike ? 
well you know the butcher's we go to on Queensway ? 
we know the man there and he's called Mike . 
but you've probably not called him Mike . 
in the butcher's ? 
<I really> [<] don't know , love . 
but she likes you „ doesn't she ? 
she's always quite nice to you . 
but I don't know what her name is .

she's not called Henry_Skyes „ is she ? 
Henry's a boy's name . 
is it ?

doesn't it look like that big ostrich egg ? 
that's a clever boy for observing that [>] . 
I don't think a crocodile'll come out . 
I think you're quite safe . 
and we bought these do you remember ? 
way back from Charlotte's party ? 
we went to the shop „ didn't we ? 
when we bought some daffodils for Grandma . 
and we bought some milk and we bought all sorts of bits and bobs . 
some food for Purdie . 
some toothpaste .

well you had toothpaste . 
it was for Daddy . 
Daddy was going for a check up at the dentist and we hadn't a lot of toothpaste . 
and we bought these pears . 
they're huge great things „ aren't they ? 
nice pears . 
it looks like an ostrich egg ? 
they're actually going very soft now these pears . 
I think they need eating quite quickly „ don't they ? 
do they smell nice ? 
well I've taken the skin off . 
I've peeled them . 
I think we could do with going down to the fruit shop because we haven't got an awful lot of fruit „ have we ? 
since Daddy (h)as been on Mummy's diet we're going through an awful lot of fruit . 
we've always gone through a lot but (.) Daddy's eating it quicker than I can buy it in .

look who's here .

what do you think ? 
is he still there , Thomas ? 
well shall we see ? 
he (h)as got a nice collar on „ hasn't he ?

she's fussy . 
she likes fresh +//. [+ IN] 
look he can see . 
oh he miaowed@o .

hello , Puss . 
there you are , sweetheart . 
your lovely dinner .

we don't give him food everyday . 
it's just if we've got some leftover . 
but Purdie wouldn't eat that you see . 
and it's an awful waste „ isn't it ? 
you going to tell Ginger all about the television program we watched this morning ? 
hm: [=! laugh] . 
you told him all about it „ have you ? 
did you mention the snakes and the spider ? 
I don't think a snake would come out of Ginger's nose . 
but a snake certainly hatched out of one of the eggs „ didn't it ? 
it was those little spiders I couldn't get over , Thomas . 
all those eggs . 
those white eggs . 
lots_of little spiders running everywhere „ weren't they ? 
oh I didn't like them . 
yeah . 
you like them . 
you like spiders . 
does Daddy not like spiders ? 
does he ? 
he has ! 
Ginger (h)as finished it . 
yes . 
I think he has . 
he's going to lick the plate round now . 
look . 
I think he (h)as enjoyed that . 
there we are . 
bye bye , Ginger . 
we'll probably see him tomorrow . 
what's he doing now ? 
oh you don't do that , Ginger . 
well we've given him a nice meal and then he goes climbing on the plants . 
I think he was going to use <Mummy's patio> [//] one of Mummy's patio tubs as a litter tray . 
oh goodness me ! 
it's hail stoning . 
didn't that happen very quickly ? 
yes . 
it (h)as +//. [+ IN] 
gosh that top [//] tub of water +//. [+ IN] 
that's the [/] the carrier that we keep <snow &-uh> [//] stones in . 
and it was empty the other day and it's almost full again with rain water . 
but +//. [+ IN] 
gosh it was the noise of the hail stones „ wasn't it „ that made us realize what it was doing . 
and I've just looked at the hanging basket , Thomas , up there +/. [+ IN] 
<and there was> [<] some little green shoots coming out the other day and I didn't know what it was . 
and they've turned into daffodils . 
can you see up there ? 
shall I just move your chair ? 
right . 
can you see those little daffodils ? 
in the hanging basket near Auntie_Linda's conservatory . 
yes ? 
where ? 
there . 
no . 
you're looking in the wrong direction on purpose „ aren't you ? 
it (h)as stopped now „ hasn't it ? 
it was just a little bit of hail that came down so quickly . 
it's a good job Ginger had just finished his dinner „ isn't it ? 
otherwise he would've +/. [+ IN] 
no . 
well we can't let him do that in the tubs „ can we ? 
that's not fair . 
well it's [//] because it's full of plants and <we don't want> [/] we don't want pussy cat <scratching them> [//] scratching the plants „ do we ? 
no . 
I don't think we do actually , Thomas . 
and Purdie doesn't do it . 
so I don't think we should let (.) another pussy cat come into the garden and do that . 
if we can help it . 
perhaps he thought he was doing Mummy a favor by watering the plants . 
but I can do without that sort of help „ can't I ? 
who's a very happy lady ? 
is he ? 
I can't see where he (h)as gone . 
but he's a little boy . 
he's not a lady . 
little pussy cat ? 
Purdie's a lady . 
Pippin's a lady . 
but the ginger pussy cat is a boy . 
well it fell down „ didn't it „ last week ? 
<it blew> [//] a branch blew down in the wind . 
in the summer ? 
well in the summer that tree's full of beautiful flowers . 
and Granddad (.) sawed the broken branch off and he said he was going to collect it this week . 
but we've had a bit of a strange week „ haven't we ? 
you don't want any toast ? 
oh I've just made a lovely piece of toast . 
<are you not hungry> [>] ? 
what for ? 
because it's breakfast time . 
and I thought you might be hungry . 
no ? 
but you keep asking for sweets „ don't you ? 
<do I> [=! laughs] . 
no . 
I'm sorry , Thomas . 
no [>] . 
I'm sure you like chocolate buttons . 
but no way . 
not if you're not eating your meals . 
it isn't dirty . 
the pear's perfectly alright . 
you've eaten three out of four pieces . 
if it was dirty I think you would have discovered before you got to the last piece „ don't you ? 
no [>] . 
I'm terribly sorry . 
no . 
well I don't think Auntie_Mabel's on again at the moment „ is she ? 
well yes I turned it off , darling , because (.) the television program we (h)ad +//. [+ IN] 
we watched Auntie_Mabel and then you watched a little bit of story time and they finished . 
and then there was something else on that was a little bit too old for you . 
well I can't talk to you properly because I can't hear what you're saying if the television's on all the time . 
I don't like <it on> [>] +... [+ IN] 
do you ? 
would you like another drink , sweetheart ? 
well can you just hold on two minutes <while I finish this> [>] ? 
Thomas . 
<come on> [<] don't be whingy . 
don't be a silly boy . 
look out the window at the front . 
it looks like it (h)as been raining quite hard . 
in a minute , Thomas sweetheart . 
why're you getting so upset ? 
I shall wipe your hands in a minute when I've finished my breakfast . 
now just because you don't wanna finish your meal (.) I'd like to finish mine please . 
if you (h)ad been a good boy and eaten your breakfast you'd still be busy eating at the table „ wouldn't you ? 
have you got pear juice running down your arm ? 
do you feel a bit sticky ? 
oh ! 
I heard the noise as well . 
it sounds a funny noise „ doesn't it ? 
I don't know . 
well it +//. [+ IN] 
oh look at the sun now . 
the sun (h)as come out . 
it sounds as if it's wind blowing down a chimney but (.) I don't think it can be here . 
because we [/] we wouldn't hear it in this side of the house . 
perhaps Uncle_Brian's doing something next door . 
the sun's beautiful now . 
can you see all the sun on your slide and swing ? 
well because the sun's shining . 
it's shining down on your toys . 
well (.) it's shining on the swing now but a few minutes ago it was hail stoning . 
the grass is very wet . 
it is , darling . 
you wanna get your wellies on and go outside and play ? 
we'll see later . 
what did you wanna do with the ginger cat ? 
frighten her ? 
well it's a him . 
but you're not going out to frighten the cat . 
it'll be nice though when the weather's a little bit warmer and the grass is dryer . 
because you had a lot of fun last summer „ didn't you ? 
in the garden every day . 
<we do> [<] go out for walks and runs though every day . 
we go to the park most days „ don't we ? 
what can you see ? 
what thing , darling [>] ? 
the windmill ? 
something on your slide turning round ? 
oops . 
what can you see on your slide turning round ? 
blue thing ? 
oh , darling , I can't see anything . 
<on your> [>] +... [+ IN] 
on your slide ? 
I can't see anything apart from the slide , love . 
<let me have a look> [>] . 
I'll look where you're looking . 
hm: . 
it looks perfectly okay . 
I don't think anybody (h)as damaged it . 
it (h)as had snow on it . 
it (h)as had hail . 
and now it (h)as got sunshine . 
would you like this piece of toast , sweetheart ? 
what do you say ? 
no thank you . 
that's a funny face . 
you're pulling a funny face and look like you're going to pretend you're going to cry . 
is that what you're doing ? 
pretending to cry ? 
oh dear [/] dear . 
we can't have Thomas upset „ can we ? 
what a funny face . 
are you not talking to me ? 
hm: [=! laugh] . 
is that what I said to him ? 
well I would imagine Ginger (h)as probably gone home now . 
and they won't realize that I've given him some food and they'll probably feed him . 
so then he'll have two breakfasts „ won't he ? 
you needta eat something ? 
what do you needta eat ? 
well you've had some pear . 
you [>] +... [+ IN] 
no , Thomas . 
you [<] useta be such a good boy not asking for sweets . 
I don't know what (h)as happened to you . 
yes . 
but you [//] just because you're a good boy you can't have sweets , Thomas . 
sometimes when you've been an exceptionally good boy <I'll give you sweets in> [>] +... [+ IN] 
exceptionally good boy now „ are you ? 
well no . 
just because you've been a good boy doesn't mean <you can have sweets all> [>] +... [+ IN] 
well the dentist wouldn't think you were a good boy if you had a lot of sweets . 
spoil your nice teeth . 
because the dentist was pleased with your teeth the other day „ wasn't he ? 
do you remember ? 
pardon [>] ? 
well after you (h)ad been to the dentist +... [+ IN] 
sorry . 
what I mean is after you (h)ad been to Charlotte's party you went to the dentist . 
and he was very pleased with you „ wasn't he ? 
so we don't wanna spoil it all by eating a lot of sweets . 
and having to go back and see him again and him say “whatever (h)as happened to those lovely teeth” ? 
<because that what (h)as> [//] that is what happens , Thomas . 
people who eat lots_of sweets and sugary things (.) their teeth all get rotten and fall out . 
and then how would you chew things ? 
you wouldn't be able to crunch your crisps „ would you ? 
your teeth would've all fallen out . 
and that would be a sorry state „ wouldn't it ? 
there we are . 
what did you say about the station ? 
I don't quite know what you're talking about now . 
yes I do ? 
no I don't , Thomas . 
I'm sorry . 
oh I see . 
Gordon had an accident at the station . 
did he bash into something ? 
at the station and he said “sorry , Sir” . 
oh I don't know what that story is , Thomas . 
is it something you've seen on (.) one of your tapes ? 
oh well . 
there you are , sweetheart . 
now are you warm enough ? 
you sure ? 
good boy . 
that's [>] +... [+ IN] 
no . 
it's not raining now . 
is it raining ? 
well (.) we'll wait till it's a little bit dryer than „ shall we ? 
yes ? 
that would be good „ wouldn't it ? 
alright . 
you can play in here (.) not out there . 
yes . 
go and sit +//. [+ IN] 
fairs up a little bit and gets a little bit warmer . 
that's the time to play out „ isn't it ? 
it's not too bad you see at the park , Thomas , because there's a lot of paths to run on . 
but here it's all grass . 
and so when it's wet it's very slippery . 
it's quite dangerous „ isn't it ? 
<if you're> [<] running you might fall . 
you fell down Granddad's thing ? 
what thing ? 
what thing do you mean ?
