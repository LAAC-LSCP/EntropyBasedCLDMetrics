well these are very old trains , Thomas . 
I don't think they're from Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
does it look like Henry ? 
I was just about say which of the green trains . 
it's Henry . 
so Grandma and Grandad took you to Preston and you went to the station and watched all the trains .

because we've not come across a yellow engine in Thomas_The_Tank_Engine „ have we ? 
oh look . 
there's another one there . 
two yellow ones .

York_Minster . 
Mummy and Daddy had their Wedding_Reception just at the side of that building .

he looks out onto that . 
I don't know , love . 
I'm not poorly . 
well I was just thinking about Grandad .

I'm alright now .

are you putting that nice bandage on my foot ? 
oh isn't that lovely ? 
that's better . 
is it better now ? 
what's the matter with Mummy's foot ? 
somebody bashed my beer . 
oh . 
what do you mean by that ? 
no . 
I don't know either [>] . 
did somebody drop a bottle of beer on my foot ?

look at the sun again now .

well that's a postcard of Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
and I've got three postcards in here . 
two of them are for your bedroom wall and one of them we'll send to Grandad . 
we'll keep this one because you haven't got a picture of Harold_the_Helicopter „ have you ? 
so we'll keep that and you choose which of these two we send to Grandad . 
well we'll put that in your bedroom because you've not got Harold_the_Helicopter . 
but look on the back of this postcard . 
can I just read this to you ? 
a little story . 
who's this a picture of , Thomas ? 
Thomas_The_Tank_Engine . 
but who's the other engine there ? 
you don't know . 
I didn't really know actually either . 
oh I do . 
it's Trevor the <Tractor_Engine> [//] the Traction_Engine because look at the story . 
and there's a space here for you to put dear . 
so you could always put dear Grandad and it says from and you could write Thomas . 
when you've finished looking at it I'll have it back and I'll read it . 
I bought those for you on the station because when we got to the station the train to Manchester was just leaving . 
I (h)ad just missed it so I hadta wait half an hour . 
so I went to the shop and I bought you some postcards . 
I bought you a little badge as well . 
yes . 
I'll go and get it . 
shall I read this story ? 
well I thought that might be a nice one to send to Grandad . 
a lantern . 
did you think that might be nice to send to Grandad ? 
because it (h)as already got a story on it and we could just put his address on and then we could write to Grandad from Thomas . 
what do you think to that ? 
do you think that would be nice , Thomas ? 
shall we do that ? 
no . 
we can't open that . 
would you like to pass me the other one ?

you mustn't open it , Thomas . 
because it's not for us . 
yes . 
yes . 
I'll show you . 
I'll show you .

something for Lynne . 
some eyeshadow . 
well I don't think Ben or Charlotte will wear this . 
it's for their Mummy . 
now there's something else in that bag for you . 
okay . 
I wonder if I'll see Postman_Pat again today . 
do you think I will ? 
yes . 
oh don't tell me he's still in bed . 
I find it hard to believe that Aunty_Mabel's up , Thomas . 
wondering whether she'll see Postman_Pat or Postman_Pat isn't up because he gets up so early „ doesn't he ? 
&-um . 
yes . 
oh look who's coming down the stairs ? 
it's Jess . 
Jess is coming down the stairs and she's wondering whether she'll see Postman_Pat today . 
she's saying meow . 
what's up , Postman_Pat . 
what's the matter . 
she's saying wakey_wakey@wp Postman_Pat . 
rise and shine . 
you've got to go and see Aunty_Mabel and deliver lots_of letters and parcels to people in the village . 
are you telling Purdie to say meow to wake you up ?

I think she's a bit shy „ isn't she ?

don't torment her , Thomas . 
Aunty_Mabel sorry . 
I wonder when I'll see Postman_Pat because the thing is . 
I've got a letter to write now „ haven't I ? 
I've got a postcard to write .

if you don't want +/. [+ IN] 
if you don't wanna do it that's alright . 
but you don't spoil it for other people who do .

there's a little ladybird . 
there must be some birds somewhere in here . 
they're stickers . 
look . 
we can stick on the windows on the patio door . 
and we've got this glass door here . 
you can do it . 
there's a sheet each . 
I was just looking to see if there was a little bird . 
there's some nice butterflys .

is that a spider ? 
you take that spider and put it on +/. [+ IN] 
right . 
I think we're going to have a break . 
and you better calm down .

shall we look at this book about the Dentist , Thomas ? 
am I a crocodile ? 
are you looking for crocodiles behind the sofa ? 
have you found any ? 
good . 
I'm pleased about that , Thomas . 
am I ? 
what do I do ? 
snap . 
snap my teeth shut . 
would you like to come and look at this book ? 
this is the book that we should have read before we went to the Dentist last week . 
but you managed very well „ didn't you ? 
you were a good boy at the Dentist „ weren't you ? 
<what's it> [/] what's it say on the back ? 
it's a picture of the Dentist and the Dental_Nurse . 
and there's a little dog . 
and the Mother is telling the dog to saty away „ isn't she ? 
shall we read it ? 
you were a very good boy at the Dentist . 
you enjoyed going „ didn't you ? 
this is a family called the Judds . 
there's Daddy and Mummy Jasper the dog . 
Jake the little boy and Jessie the little girl . 
yes .

this is the Dental_Nurse called Miss_Day . 
you can't take the dog into the Surgery „ can you ? 
oh and this is Mister_Drake the Dentist .

he's checking their teeth . 
do you remember Daddy lying on a bed like that „ didn't he ? 
do you remember that bright light that shone above you and Daddy ? 
can you see that little mirror ?

do you remember seeing Daddy do that ? 
what did he do ? 
rinse his mouth out . 
and then what did he do ? 
did he spit into that bowl ? 
yes . 
he did . 
right . 
it's Jake's turn now . 
Jessie (h)as finished . 
that must be where it hurt . 
this is what I tell you about sweets and things , Thomas . 
because sweets attack your teeth and cause little holes in your teeth . 
if you get a hole in your tooth you get toothache like Jake in the story does . 
yes . 
the Dentist is looking in Jake's mouth and he (h)as found a little hole „ hasn't he ? 
well when you eat too many sweets it causes holes in your teeth . 
that's why we say we can't have any sweets . 
it's a little bit like cement . 
oh Jake's filled tooth . 
this is what Jake's filled tooth looks like now .

you look as if you might go to sleep over your meal . 
come on , Thomas_Henry . 
is that how you feel ? 
you feel tired . 
well you look tired . 
I was going to suggest if it's not raining when you've eaten your tea that we should go for a little walk round the park . 
what do you think ? 
because that will help you sleep „ won't it ? 
if you get some fresh air . 
now what do you think to that ? 
do you not like it ? 
oh you had one mouthful with the fork . 
one mouthful with your spoon and you've gone back to eating your peas . 
did you not like the pasta ?

Postman_Pat likes it .

and they pick up the next one and throw it in the machine . 
they don't take twenty at once and throw them all in at once . 
they'd drop them .
