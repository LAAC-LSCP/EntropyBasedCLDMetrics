only the fire station usually has red doors with a lot of glass . 
just pretending [//] you're just pretending it was a fire station . 
how's that ? 
that's fine „ is it ? 
ooh the door's open . 
gosh that's magic .

then they wouldn't be lost anymore „ would they ? 
shall we do our story about the lost bear ? 
okay . 
you've got the book here . 
shall we read that ? 
it's called sailor bear „ isn't it ? 
Small bear is a bear in a sailor suit who's lost and has no one to play with . 
he thinks and he thinks and he looks at his suit and decides to go to sea . 
right . 
shall we read the story ? 
no . 
I think he's dragging his boat out to sea in that picture „ isn't he ? 
right . 
shall we start the story ? 
small bear was a bear in a sailor suit . [+ R] 
he was lost and had no one to play with . [+ R] 
“now what shall I do” wondered small bear . [+ R] 
he thought and he thought and he looked at his suit and he knew what to do . [+ R] 
I'll be a sailor and sail on the sea decided small bear .[+ R] 
but he hadn't a boat .[+ R] 
“now what shall I do” wondered small bear .[+ R] 
he thought and he thought then he looked at the sea and knew what to do .[+ R] 
“I'll go and get one” decided small bear .[+ R] 
he went to the harbor but the boats there were too big for a bear .[+ R] 
“oh now what shall I do” wondered small bear .[+ R] 
he thought and he thought and he looked round the shore and he knew what to do . [+ R] 
“small bears need small boats so I'll make one” decided small bear . [+ R] 
he made a boat from some pieces of wood and half a barrel . [+ R] 
he called it Bear's Boat and he took it down to the sea .[+ R] 
but the sea looked too big for his boat . 
“oh now what shall I do” wondered small bear .[+ R] 
bother ! 
you just +//. [+ IN] 
oh bother . 
that's fantastic . 
it's a pity that wasn't on video , Thomas . 
oh bother . 
&=laughs . 
you did look concerned then . 
he thought and he thought and he looked at a puddle and he knew what to do .[+ R] 
“small boats need small sea so I'll find one” decided small bear .[+ R] 
he went to the park where he found a small sea and small bear sailed in Bear's boat by the light of the moon .[+ R] 
look . 
there's nobody about at all apart from the moon and the stars in the sky and those little geese . 
he's quite happy sailing in that little boat . 
the sea grew too rough .[+ R] 
Bear's boat rocked and it rolled and it shattered and sank .[+ R] 
oh dear . 
what (h)as happened to his hat , Thomas ? 
blown in the sea ? 
oh dear . 
he won't [=! won't] get his hat back „ will he ? 
it looks like it (h)as been washed away . 
ah . 
small bear swam and swam until he reached the shore where he lay on a rock all shivering .[+ R] 
it's a very big rock „ isn't it ? 
look . 
he's lying on the rock all shivering and cold . 
no . 
because look . 
can you see it's night time and the stars and moon are out and it's dark . 
ah he looks really upset when he's in the water but he swims and he manages to reach that huge rock . 
doesn't he look [/] doesn't he look sad . 
is he more like a big dolphin lying there ? 
he (h)as no hat and he is crying and the water's dripping off him . 
well I don't know . 
I think he'd like his hat back . 
I don't know whether he'll get it back . 
“now what shall I do” wondered small bear .[+ R] 
he is lost „ isn't he . 
he thought and he thought then he sighed at the moon for he didn't know what to do .[+ R] 
“I'm sick of the sea so I think I'll give up” decided small bear with a sniff .[+ R] 
he curled up by the rock and went soundly to sleep all alone .[+ R] 
look . 
that's a picture of night time . 
ah he's looking <very sad> [>] . 
yes . 
you've got your moon up on the farm house „ haven't you ? 
that's right . 
oh but get ready to change it (be)cause the next page ah +... [+ IN] 
look . 
the sun's shining . 
it's bright . 
little bear's still asleep by the rock but who's coming down the hill ? 
a dog and a girl . 
it's day time . 
the very next morning a little girl came and she found small bear and she hugged him and took him home and set him to dry by the fire .[+ R] 
“now what shall I do” wondered small bear . 
he thought and he thought and he looked at the girl and he knew what to do . 
+" I'm found . [+ R] 
“and I've someone to play with so I'll stay [/] stay where I am” decided small bear . [+ R] 
and he cuddled up close to the girl and he stayed and he never went back to the sea .[+ R] 
didn't he ? 
all right . 
well let's read <the little bit back> [//] the little bit at the back again . 
the very next morning a little girl came and she found small bear and she hugged him and took him home to the fire station with the big red doors and the window box and the cat and the donkey . 
when sometimes there was an owl in the sky with the stars and the moon and other times there was a cockerel crowing and the sun shining . 
and the door bell would ting@o at the farm house . 
the fire station farm house and the doors would open and there would be a big welcome . 
and she sat the little bear by the fire to dry . 
“now what shall I do” wondered small bear .[+ R] 
he thought and he thought and he looked at the girl and he knew what to do .[+ R]

you need weighing . 
you're a ton weight „ aren't you ? 
there we are now . 
be ever so careful with these . 
well because we don't wanna lose them . 
and what I'm going to do with this scale pan is just pop a piece of kitchen paper in the bottom because if we start putting things in the pan it's going to make an awful lot of noise „ isn't it ? 
so we'll do that and let's find something . 
how about these shells we brought back from Spain ? 
do you remember ? 
what was too late ? 
no . 
we need that (be)cause otherwise it's going to damage the scale pan because it really is for food it's not for stones and shells „ is it ? 
do you remember when Daddy bought you that digger in Spain [>] ? 
some marbles xxx [>] ? 
another marble . 
right . 
that's right . 
the marbles can go in this side . 
you're putting them where the weights go „ are you ? 
okay . 
and then you're going to see how many stones and shells it takes in this pan to be the same weight as the marbles at the other side . 
can you reach it ? 
shall we move it closer to you ? 
oops a daisy . 
oh yes . 
it's very heavy „ isn't it ? 
well Daddy bought you a little toy digger in Spain „ didn't he ? 
are you ? 
and we went to the beach and what did we pick ? 
I will . 
did we pick up a few shells and some very small stones to put in your digger „ didn't we ? 
and that's what we're playing with now . 
be careful . 
that's it . 
can you remember collecting them , Thomas ? 
we useta go down to the beach at night „ didn't we ? 
it was still very wet . 
and where did the marbles come from ? 
from Julian . 
Julian from music time group . 
music lessons . 
yes . 
as we left on Friday +... [+ IN] 
well I say on Friday [//] the last Friday we were there you found those in the car park „ didn't you ? 
okay . 
&=laughs . 
oh that was handy „ wasn't it ? 
what did you say ? 
I'm going to shift you ? 
right . 
we mustn't knock those on the floor (be)cause if that landed on your foot , Thomas . 
that big pile of weight . 
it would break your foot „ wouldn't it ? 
shall we put the very big ones over here ? 
it is . 
it's eight ounces , darling . 
it would still hurt you if it fell on your toe . 
I think they would all hurt you if they fell on your toe [>] . 
four ounces . 
alright . 
we'll take [/] we'll +/. [+ IN] 
alright . 
well just please don't drop it on your toe „ will you ? 
have you seen all these different shells ? 
look how beautiful +//. [+ IN] 
oh we got some xxx I was going to say how beautiful and smooth this is but we picked some of these up for Linda and Bryan .[+ PI] 
do you remember ? 
we forget to give them to them „ didn't we ? 
look . 
that's a beautiful shiny smooth shell . 
nut look at this one . 
it's all rigid and rough . 
just feel that . 
oh it's not too bad . 
it still feels beautiful „ doesn't it ? 
but they're all different . 
that one feels a bit rough . 
but these were superb on the beach „ weren't they ? 
anyway lovely things to look and dig . 
I think your digger might be making a +/. [+ IN] 
the wheels click a little bit . 
they make quite a lot of noise „ don't they ? 
I've never noticed that before . 
Dig and Dug have lots_of turnips do they [>] ? 
you're whispering and I can't tell what you said . 
you're talking about Dig and Dug which is something on video „ isn't it ? 
it's a little bit like Bob_The_Builder . 
Dig and Dug and <their friend Daisy> [>] +/. [+ IN] 
there is a hook on the tractor . 
I wonder what that's for ? 
what do you think the tractor +/. [+ IN] 
it's for parcels is it ? 
hm: . 
so you're trying to tell me about a story in Dig and Dug . 
oh let's +//. [+ IN] 
no . 
we mustn't throw it straight into the pan . 
we hafta put it on that piece of kitchen paper first . 
no , Thomas . 
no . 
we can't because we're going to damage the pan . 
that pan is for food it's not for throwing stones in . 
no . 
if you do that it'll hafta go away . 
it'll damage the pan . 
here we are . 
let's put this nice piece of paper on . 
no [<] , Thomas . 
stones must not go straight into it . 
it will damage it . 
no . 
if you're not going to play nicely with it it goes away . 
come on . 
here we are . 
there we are . 
what do you think is going to be lighter ? 
this stone or this shell ? 
which is heavy ? 
seven one ? 
that's a four ounce weight . 
are you going to put that on there ? 
and we'll see if we've got enough stones and shells to weight four ounces shall we ? 
no . 
let's pop all the stones in this side and see if we've got four ounces of shells and stones shall we ? 
we probably should be saying this in metric now , Thomas . 
about a hundred grams „ isn't it ? 
yes . 
it's nice though „ isn't it ? 
beautifully shaped aren't they ? 
just feel the different textures . 
Some are shiny and smooth others are rough . 
that one's rough „ isn't it ? 
the same [<] with the stones . 
I mean +/. [+ IN] 
this is a beautiful shiny stone . 
get one that'll stay on then . 
this is quite a rough piece of stone „ isn't it ? 
a rough pebble . 
hm: . 
well we did actually when we were collecting some of these stones we did say we'd give some to Grandma . 
and some to Linda and Bryan for the garden they've got . 
you're probably enjoying playing with them more than they would at the moment so +... [+ IN] 
off we go . 
and it's nice to remember our holiday in Spain „ isn't it ? 
when we look at them . 
where to put it ? 
well shall we put it in there ? 
there we are . 
oh we're not going to need many more stones now before we've got four ounces „ are we ? 
right . 
do you remember which shop Daddy bought the digger from ? 
which shop was it in Spain ? 
well every night after we (h)ad had our evening meal we went for a walk „ didn't we ? 
sometimes it was just me and you and other times we all went . 
and each night we went to the shop to buy a carton of milk for your bed time drink „ didn't we ? 
and what did the lady in the shop give you ? 
a big digger ? 
oh she didn't give you the big digger . 
Daddy bought the digger . 
but what did she give you ? 
something to eat ? 
can you not remember ? 
well last year when we went to Spain the lady in the shop had a little child with her . 
a little girl about the same age as you and she useta have a little bicycle in the shop she useta <ride round with> [//] ride round on . 
and she liked the Tele tubbies „ didn't she ?

and you didn't „ did you ? 
and we were there for ages and ages (be)cause we couldn't decide which one to have and in the end you said La la .
