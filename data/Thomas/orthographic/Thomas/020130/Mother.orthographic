she's not a kitten though „ is she ?

<are you so tired> [//] <are you tired> [//] oh are you tired ? 
this is a nappie sack . 
yes . 
Thomas , you've got a really big scratch on your tummy . 
Thomas , what happened ? 
it's a scratch on your tummy . 
I don't know how you've got that . 
because your nails are quite short . 
do you remember having your nails cut ? 
po@c snip_snip@o . 
that's right . 
red handled scissors . 
yes . 
we have <blue snip_snips> [//] blue scissors . 
and we have red scissors „ don't we ? 
the blue scissors are your scissors . 
and the red scissors are my scissors . 
my scissors . 
but we use whichever (i)s to hand at the time . 
and we cut your nails on Sunday „ didn't we ? 
no . 
oh perhaps it was Monday . 
Nana choc_choc@f bag .

Nana's coming today but you better not greet her with that . 
she's not going to be very pleased „ is she ? 
if she walks through the door and you have a look at her bag to see if she (h)as brought you any chocolate . 
no . 
you mustn't say that to her when she arrives . 
Mummy is going to work this morning . 
and Daddy's going to work . 
no . 
Daddy doesn't work at a chip shop . 
Nana chip shops . 
yes . 
are you blowing as if to blow on hot chips to cool them down ? 
wash and down . 
oh I see . 
are you planing what's going to happen during the day ? 
you're going to go in the car with Granddad to the chip shop . 
have some chips . 
blow them to cool them down . 
and then have a wash . 
get out of your highchair . 
and a sleep . 
is that what you're planing ? 
well that sounds like a funny day , Thomas . 
your life revolves around food „ doesn't it ? 
yes . 
choc_choc@f . 
talking of food . 
I think I better feed Purdie „ hadn't I ? 
a big poo_poo . 
why are you saying “a big poo_poo” ? 
oh poor Thomas . 
you're yawning .

and the plate flew in the air „ didn't it ? 
yes . 
it did .

you did . 
what were we talking about yesterday ? 
do you remember ? 
Bow's food and football . 
well yes .

and what happened ? 
Dipsy threw a Lego brick „ didn't he ? 
he did . 
and it hit Po . 
and made Po cry . 
and what [/] what did Mummy say ? 
Mummy said no throwing . 
the only time you're allowed to throw is throwing a football when you're outside in the garden . 
you can't throw a football inside „ can you ? 
no . 
because apart from hitting Purdie's food what else could happen ? 
where else could the football hit ? 
are you pointing to the light ? 
it could hit the light „ couldn't he ? 
football . 
it could hit the light . 
and if you throw other things it might hit somebody . 
no football . 
you wouldn't like it if you were playing with somebody and they threw something and it hit you „ would you ? 
so what do we say ? 
no throwing . 
what do we say ? 
no throwing . 
I don't think you're taking this seriously .

Purdie's behind you . 
as soon as we've got you safely in this chair I'm going to give her some fresh food .

beeba@c . 
I'm pouring some water into the steam iron .

yes . 
can you see the garden , Thomas ? 
Mummy put some plants in this morning „ didn't she ? 
before you got up . 
she watered them and then it started to rain . 
it wasn't raining yesterday „ was it , Thomas ? 
choc_choc@f . 
it was so sunny yesterday at lunchtime that you hadta have some suntan cream . 
you're not having choc_choc@f . 
and what's Thomas going to do today with Grandma and Granddad ? 
yes . 
oh dear . 
do you think you'll be going out in the car with Granddad ? 
no . 
not to the chip shop . 
do you think you'll be going anywhere else ? 
Nana bump .

Nana's chair that Mummy was sitting in . 
<did you just see a bird then , Thomas> [//] did you see a bird ? 
cheep_cheep .

say Grandma is your head better after your bump last week . 
no . 
well it would be nice if you did . 
hello , Grandma . 
how are you ?

oh Cornflakes [//] you're passing me the Cornflakes . 
oops .

I'll just unplug the iron . 
I made a cup of tea earlier on . 
I forgot to pour it . 
no . 
Daddy (h)as not gone yet . 
he (h)as just gone outside I think . 
to have a look at the car .

and wave him off . 
oh dear . 
is there a mess , Thomas ? 
have you made a mess ? 
what have you done ? 
tipped your juice up . 
a spoon . 
right . 
Daddy (h)as started up the car now .

what color's the spoon , Thomas ? 
can you remember ? 
silver . 
Daddy's going now . 
are you going to wave him off ? 
byebye , Daddy . 
oh , Thomas . 
you were too busy asking about your train to wave Daddy off . 
poor Daddy . 
yes . 
poor Daddy's going off to do a hard day at work . 
and you didn't wave him off . 
oh dear dear . 
what will he think ? 
there you are . 
here's the train . 
the toast must have popped up without Mummy hearing it . 
big choo_choos@f . 
well I'm just trying to find all the pieces . 
the trouble is when you play with your train at the table +/. [+ N] 
bless you . 
did you sneeze ? 
no . 
it sounded like a sneeze to me . 
when you play with your train at the table it gets sticky „ doesn't it ? 
and it gets crumbs in it . 
so I hafta keep washing it . 
that's why you can never find it . 
because half of it's on the draining board . 
yes . 
yes . 
oh no . 
not through the Cornflakes , Thomas . 
if you've finished with those I'm going to clear them away . 
there you are . 
there's the train . 
come on . 
let's put all these back in the bowl . 
you're making a mess , Thomas . 
listen [/] listen to me . 
if you keep making a mess you're going to hafta sit back on the baby chair . 
you threw them on the floor . 
listen , Thomas . 
Mummy hasn't got time +/. [+ IN] 
+, to keep picking up all the crumbs and all the Cornflakes +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
+, of the floor . [+ IN] 
<and that whoops> [//] and that's what you're doing „ isn't it ? 
you're dropping them on the floor on purpose . 
that's right . 
can you put the spoon in the tray ? 
that's what you were doing yesterday . 
oh has the spoon tipped out ? 
there you are . 
would you like to give the train driver some Cornflakes ? 
right . 
the toast is ready now , Thomas . 
yes . 
I haven't got any Marmite this morning . 
no Marmite and no spreading cheese . 
so you can have half a slice of jam and half a slice with orange marmalade . 
Mummy still hasn't poured a cup of tea . 
it's going to be stewed . 
that's the milk . 
yes . 
that's the spoon . 
is the spoon riding about in the back of the train ? 
no . [+ SR] 
yes . 
that's Mummy's cup of tea . 
no . 
you mustn't hit the cup of tea with the train . 
because the tea's very hot „ isn't it ? 
you'll get burnt . 
yes . 
what are you telling me ? 
are you telling me the driver's sitting in the train ? 
is that what you're telling me ? 
I can't tell what you're saying , Thomas . 
what are you trying to tell me ? 
what are you trying to tell Mummy ? 
oh dear . 
has the train tipped up now ? 
oh dear . 
the spoon's going to fall out „ isn't it ? 
oh dear . 
spoon . 
the spoon did fall out . 
can you find it ? 
can you reach it ? 
that's a good boy . 
yes . 
have you hit the juice with the train ? 
it's a good job the juice is in a leak proof cup „ isn't it ? 
otherwise it would be spilling everywhere . 
it would be an awful mess . 
Daddy (h)as gone to work . 
I bet you get sticky fingers this morning , Thomas . 
because you've got toast with jam and toast with marmalade . 
there you are . 
two slices with orange marmalade and two slices with strawberry jam . 
oh look at that . 
po@c . 
yes . 
red jam . 
Mummy's going to put a piece of toast in for her now . 
a piece of toast for Mummy . 
please may I sit with you now , Thomas ? 
it's a good job we went to see Jill and Bethany yesterday „ isn't it ? 
yellow . 
yes . 
marmalade . 
it's orange rather than yellow . 
because it it had been a day like today raining we wouldn't have been able to play in the garden . 
do you remember playing in the sandpit with Isabel and Bethany ? 
no . 
and then we all had a picnic lunch „ didn't we ? 
yes . 
Isabel's Mummy gave you some chocolate „ didn't she ? 
is the jam nice ? 
mm . 
yellow marmalade and red jam . 
oh dear . 
what's that noise ? 
it sounds like the toaster's in trouble . 
hasn't quite cooked so I'll pop it down for a few more minutes or seconds would be better „ wouldn't it ? 
more pop . 
oh I thought you'd got a scratch on your face . 
and it's red jam . 
can you see Sue leaving for work ? 
yes . 
she's leaving very early this morning „ isn't she ? 
byebye , Sue . 
byebye , Sue . 
and it's pouring with rain . 
we've popped the toaster „ haven't we ? 
I think it's alright . 
I think it was just making a funny noisy . 
you're scraping the jam off with your fingers and then sucking your fingers „ aren't you ? 
rather than eating the toast . 
have you got sticky fingers ? 
are you sucking your fingers ? 
does it taste good ? 
Sue's door . 
yes . 
you can see Sue's door quite clearly . 
but she's not there „ is she ? 
she (h)as gone . 
yellow more . 
you want some more toast with marmalade . 
you look a sleepy boy . 
oh dear . 
have you got it all over your fingers ? 
which fingers ? 
Mister_Thumb Mister_Pointer Mister_Middle Ruby_Ring and Mister_Small . 
and on Mummy's hand it's Missus_Thumb Missus_Pointer Missus_Middle Ruby_Ring and Missus_Small . 
that's Mummy's ring . 
that's a diamond . 
two po@c . 
two pieces of toast with red jam on . 
right . 
Mummy better butter and put some marmalade on her piece of toast . 
well then I better dry some dishes I think . 
no chocolate . 
we haven't any chocolate in the house , Thomas . 
can you see all these dishes ? 
and pots [//] clean pots . 
they all need drying and putting away in the cupboard . 
why don't you eat the toast instead of just licking the jam and the marmalade ? 
it's orange marmalade , Thomas . 
can you say marmalade ? 
the pot of marmalade's nearly empty now „ isn't it ? 
pot of marmalade nearly empty . 
going to put the lid back on the jar . 
the pot of jam has a lid that screws on . 
but the marmalade has a cellophane cover . 
putting on now . 
see you , yellow . 
fasten it tightly with a rubber+band because the marmalade's home+made . 
so it hasn't got a screw+top lid like the jam . 
there we are . 
pop it back in the fridge . 
xxx breakfast . [+ PI] 
red jam . 
that's right . 
there's some lasagne in the fridge . 
left from last night's tea . 
if you'd like that for your lunch . 
and if you don't want that there's <some cheese> [>] . 
oh , Thomas . 
there isn't choc_choc@f in there . 
oh_gosh you're quite right . 
there is . 
oh_gosh you've discovered the Maltesers . 
a@p po@c box . 
no . 
it might be empty , Thomas . 
that's the box of Maltesers that Daddy bought for Mummy . 
and I've just remembered that I'd hidden them in the fridge so you wouldn't find them . 
that was a bit silly of me then to leave the fridge door open . 
no . 
don't say no to your toast just because you've seen those . 
because you're not having any . 
oh the juice is empty . 
let me put some more juice in the bottle . 
you only want more juice because I've got to open the fridge door . 
there's a pot of apple in the fridge . 
no . 
we haven't got any grapes . 
we've got some apple . 
it's the apple Mummy cut up last night and put it in a box in the fridge to save some time this morning . 
you've gone back to eating Cornflakes . 
here you are . 
orange juice . 
there you are . 
I've taken the lid of the pot of apples . 
it's apple . 
a big juice . 
yes . 
it is quite a big beaker of juice „ isn't it ? 
no . 
it's apple not pear . 
no pear . 
yes . 
it's apple . 
I'm going to fill the jug with water from the kettle and let it cool . 
and then if you want a drink during the day (.) the water's ready „ isn't it ? 
you'll be able to ask Grandma for a drink of juice . 
we'll leave that to cool . 
are you going to say goodbye to the bread because that's going back in the bread bin now ? 
byebye , bread . 
you'll probably see the bread again at lunchtime „ won't you ? 
no . 
it's a blue bag , Thomas . 
not a red bag . 
is that what you were saying ? 
a po@c bag . 
no . 
it's not pear . 
it's apple , Thomas . 
are you all right ? 
yes . 
xxx for now . 
be careful . 
that's the only thing .

it's raining so heavily . 
it's not nice outside today „ is it ? 
you look very serious this morning . 
are you happy ?

be careful . 
if you tip it up like that it's going to spill „ isn't it ? 
what about some apple ? 
would you like to eat some apple ? 
oh I see you're tipping a few Cornflakes into the back of the train „ are you ?

you've nearly eaten them all „ haven't you ? 
is the bowl empty now ? 
oh are you wearing it as a hat ? 
that's pleasant .
