yes ? 
right . 
would you like to put the lid on ? 
no . 
ooh . 
no . 
(be)cause it's pot it'll break its casserole lid . 
right . 
that's right . 
carefully pick that up . 
that's it then . 
<xxx this > [<] . [+ PI] 
it's like a symbol „ isn't it ? 
I think we'd make a jolly loud crash . 
right . 
now . 
I'm going to pop it in the oven . 
<&-uh &-uh> [/] &-uh . 
we don't need the firemen . 
it's just steam . 
right . 
excuse me . 
right [<] . 
there you are . 
now . 
don't touch the cooker . 
and that's it now . 
the [<] shop ? 
mhm . 
it is . 
C@l . 
w@l . 
the . 
door . 
&d . 
right . 
now . 
will you remind me please . 
in a little while . 
quite a long time actually . 
I needta do [//] cook some rice that you've helped get ready . 
what would I have done without your shop tonight ? 
because I needed chicken . 
I needed carrots . 
could I have bought the wine and mushrooms from you as well ? 
well I've [/] I've made it now . 
but you [/] you do sell wine „ do you ? 
ooh right . 
didn't know that . 
so if I make that again and come to your shop for some wine and mushroom +/. [+ IN] 
right . 
are you ? 
ooh . 
now . 
I'll tell you what . 
let's [//] would you +/. [+ IN] 
would you like to have +/. [+ IN] 
why are you sad ? 
well . 
perhaps it's &-uh +... [+ IN] 
perhaps nobody's posted anything since it was last emptied . 
mhm . 
ah dear . 
well . 
think xxx [>] .[+ PI] 
xxx [<] . 
yes [<] . 
I do as well . 
look . 
I'm just out for a little stroll and I think I'll post this letter with a red stamp . 
that can go in first class . 
and (.) oh . 
one with the blue stamp on is the second . 
that actually could be an airmail stamp . 
it's got a picture of an aeroplane on it . 
I did . 
ooh . 
goodness me . 
&=laughs . 
hello , Mr_Shop man . 
<that was a shock > [>] . 
that was a shock . 
I was just trying to post my letters . 
now , Mr Shop man . 
watch your head . 
could we have a little +/. [+ IN] 
right . 
well . 
you're not having any more . 
could we please have a little look in your freezer cabinet and see if we've got some frozen sweetcorn ? 
okay . 
would you like to come ? 
is it ? 
right . 
thank you . 
xxx . 
&-um . 
<oh look > [<] . 
first thing I come to . 
that was lucky „ wasn't it ? 
did you ? 
did you think somebody would come in and ask you to buy some ? 
you're doing what the post office lady did last night „ aren't you ? 
yes please . 
oh wow . 
right . 
now what did she xxx [>] ? [+ PI] 
what did she have with her ? 
a scanner ? 
right . 
you scan it like she scanned +/. [+ IN] 
scan . 
and where did she say you scanned it ? 
well it's so that (.) +... [+ IN] 
so what , love ? 
well . 
she had a really really huge bunch of keys „ didn't she ? 
and she said there's a different key for every letter box . 
it would take somebody a long long time to work out which key fitted which box . 
and they could probably set up a trap and catch them . 
whereas if one key opened all the boxes . 
then the person finding the key could whiz round all over opening letter boxes . 
and the reason she scanned it was because she can't say to her boss “oh yes” . 
+" I emptied the post box on Chivington_Drive . 
if she didn't because that [//] when she scans it it transfers a little message back to her boss to say that she's emptied the box . 
but also it's checking the time she empties it . 
because you know how when she opened it . 
on the scanner thing . 
there was a little message and it said “don't forget to change the tag” . 
well . 
the tag is [/] is that little &-um disc that says one . 
two or three collections . 
do you know the one we mean ? 
when we look to see which number +/. [+ IN] 
ooh . 
yes . 
you don't keep freezers [//] bananas in the freezer . 
and (.) when those numbers are up . 
one . 
two and three . 
it tells you the last time the post has been collected . 
so I think for us . 
here . 
if number one's up . 
it means the post is collected at something like seven o'clock in the morning . 
if number two is up . 
it's collected at quarter past eleven in the morning . 
if number three is up . 
it's collected at quarter to six at night . 
and so (.) if she tries to collect it before quarter to six . 
and somebody posts letters at quarter to six . 
they're going to be really really really cross if she's already collected it and they've missed the last post . 
so it also checks that she's not emptying the box too early . 
(be)cause we'd be really annoyed „ wouldn't we ? 
if we had a birthday card for your friend . 
and we went to the box [>] . 
well . 
yes <and it> [//] and if somebody thought right@q . 
we'll post Thomas a card now . 
that'll get there in the morning . 
and when they got to the post box the post had already been collected because the post man had come too early . 
so that's what she said it's for . 
it's quite a good idea really , love . 
isn't it ? 
I'm sure he would . 
he likes little treats . 
pardon ? 
a sweet ? 
mhm . 
oh . 
yes please . 
do you remember when we filled those with sweets , Thomas ? 
no . 
we can't . 
because it's too near tea time . 
we could but I don't think we should . 
a chocolate sweet ? 
go on . 
yes . 
that would be nice please . 
<right there we are > [<] . 
what are these , Thomas ? 
chicken yoghurt . 
chicken nuggets . 
right . 
well . 
I've got that from your freezer cabinet <as well> [>] . 
thank you very much . 
does it ? 
would you like to pop this sweetcorn into a bowl for me ? 
please [>] . 
take the clip off the packet . 
right ? 
right . 
come out of the freezer so that your xxx .[+ PI] 
I'll hold the bowl . 
right . 
frozen pea . 
well . 
it's not frozen peas . 
throw in the sweetcorn . 
sounds like the dried rice .

now just xxx over the bowl .[+ PI]

is it ? 
there we are . 
well . 
your little shop is very very useful . 
&-um (.) ah . 
cornflakes . 
please . 
I can see a packet of cornflakes . 
because I think we wanted those „ didn't +/. [+ IN] 
you're drinking dirty beer „ are you [>] ? 
cornflakes . 
wonderful . 
now . 
what do we have on cornflakes ? 
cock a doodle doos ? 
no . 
I was thinking more about milk . 
have you (.) got a bottle of milk please ? 
we could do with some more things really for this little shop . 
I wonder if we can buy some ? 
very [/] very small packets . 
(be)cause I know you can get pretend food and fruit and packets and things . 
but they're all much too big to go in your shop „ aren't they ? 
well you think it's in there do you ? 
I thought I'd seen it . 
oh no . 
it's orange juice I can see . 
oh . 
there it is , Thomas . 
it's on the top shelf . 
look . 
where you not ? 
oh . 
you're looking for a book of stamps „ were you ? 
from the post office lady ? 
what did she say her pussy cat was called , Thomas ? 
Pinky . 
why did she say it was called Pinky ? 
a pink nose ? 
mm . 
<if it had> [<] a cold she could call it Runny . 
or Drippy . 
Whippy ? 
no . 
I mean Drippy . 
as in a drippy nose . 
talking of pussy cats . 
who's that ? 
behind you . 
on the fence . 
who is it ? 
it's Felix . 
he looks very nice actually . 
his white bits are beautiful and white „ aren't they ? 
he's a nice little puss . 
he's clean . 
yes please . 
&-um yes please . 
yes . 
please . 
because tomorrow morning we could both have +/. [+ IN] 
+, a glass of orange juice . 
followed by cornflakes and milk . 
and then this evening . 
before going to bed . 
that I like . 
oh . 
coffee . 
yes . 
we'll have coffee as well . 
and I was just about to say before going to bed . 
tonight . 
we could have a nice milky drink . 
water and milk . 
milky coffee . 
other biscuit ? 
&-uh what are they ? 
that's a tin of ? 
peas and a tin of ? 
sketti@c . 
spaghetti hoops . 
well . 
your shop needs restocking now . 
right . 
so there's peas and +/. [+ IN] 
<I'll take> [>] those because my little boy likes peas . 
and you like spaghetti hoops . 
so if we took those then we'd always have something in the cupboard „ wouldn't we ? 
yes . 
okay . 
well . 
look . 
your shop is very useful (be)cause it's so near to where I live . 
so I could actually just be standing at my +/. [+ IN] 
ooh . 
Felix is chasing magpies , Thomas . 
look at this . 
don't go to the glass but can you see ? 
oh . 
isn't this funny (be)cause magpies are not frightened of pussy cats . 
and Felix has turned round to face the bird . 
and the bird is just +/. [+ IN] 
0 [=! gasps loudly] . 
goodness me . 
did you see that ? 
I was just about to say “the bird is not frightened of Felix” and it went straight for his face . 
straight for Felix's face and he's +... [+ IN] 
the bird's flown off now . 
and Felix looks a little bit surprised . 
he is . 
I think he's a bit humiliated . 
<he's a> [/] he's a bit +/. [+ IN] 
no . 
I think Felix is a bit embarrassed because it was a bird . 
because usually birds are frightened of pussy cats and I think that's why Felix turned round . 
(be)cause he thought “ooh wonderful” . 
+" a bird so close . 
+" I'll have that . 
but the magpie thought hm@q . 
+" have you first . 
right .

I could pretend that I was +... [+ IN]

Fog_Lane in Didsbury .

watch your head , Thomas . 
you want me to help you empty the letter box ?
