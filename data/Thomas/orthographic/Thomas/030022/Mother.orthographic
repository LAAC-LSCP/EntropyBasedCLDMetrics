is that all you're going to say ? 
is it ? 
well we went to York in the car „ didn't we ? 
with Daddy .

and who did we go and see ? 
did we see Nana and Granddad_Bealby ? 
oh , Thomas , don't be silly . 
talk to me please . 
we saw the Somerfield's lorrys on the motorway „ didn't we ? 
because Grandma and Granddad live quite near a Somerfield supermarket . 
we can see the sign for the supermarket from their house „ can't we ? 
green hosepipe ? 
oh yes . 
that's silly . 
I held you up to the bedroom window and said “look , Thomas , what can you see” .

all the yellow helmets . 
were they hanging up as well ? 
and then what was next to the fire station ? 
the bus station . 
and what was happening at the bus station ? 
well the buss were being washed and you said it was more like a dustbin man because the man who was washing the buss (.) Grandma said was actually a dustbin man during the week . 
because it was Saturday when we went „ wasn't it ? 
and she said during the week the man who collects [//] was washing the buss was actually a dustbin man . 
he's a jolly nice person to know [?] , Thomas „ isn't he ? 
wouldn't you have a lot of fun with him in a working week ? 
going round collecting all the rubbish and then on Saturdays washing the buss at the bus depot . 
when you saw buss being washed on Teletubbies were they washed with the same thing ? 
so you (h)ad seen something like that before „ had you ? 
no . 
the fire engines were just in the station which was lucky . 
because if they (h)ad to go out it would have meant there (h)ad been a fire somewhere . 
but no the man had a +//. [+ IN] 
it was almost like a car wash „ wasn't it ? 
it was a great big tall thing as high as +//. [+ IN] 
in fact higher than the double decker buss . 
and it was on a stand . 
and as he pulled it along (.) slowly along the side of the bus the brushes rotated „ didn't they ? 
and the water jetted onto the buss . 
and the buss had a wash . 
yes . 
he walked slowly round the whole length of the bus . 
down one side and then round the back and along the other side . 
and then he disappeared . 
we didn't see him when he was washing the other bit „ could we ? 
excuse me . 
and then he [/] he walked round the other side „ didn't he ? 
but all the time the brushes were going very quickly and the water was jeting . 
and it washed the top and the side of the bus „ didn't it ? 
and didn't it look clean when he (h)ad finished ? 
so that was good because +/. [+ IN] 
that's right . 
there was a small bus „ wasn't there ? 
was it standing next too another bus ? 
ah . 
baby bus [//] the small bus +//. [+ IN] 
was it a mini bus or just a single decker ? 
a single decker ? 
mhm . 
and all those buss you saw being washed (.) would be going to York or Hull „ wouldn't they ? 
we did . 
we came home after we (h)ad been to the fire station and bus station we went back to Grandma_Bealby's for (.) some tea „ didn't we ? 
because we (h)ad been for some shopping . 
did you ? 
oh right . 
was it great ? 
because we went shopping with Grandma „ didn't we ? 
and then (.) we went to the fire station and the bus station . 
I think you (h)ad already been for a walk with Granddad and Daddy before that „ hadn't you ? 
and then we went back to Grandma's house for tea . 
and then after tea you and Daddy went back to see the fire station „ didn't you ? 
while Mummy helped Grandma with the washing up . 
and did you play with Granddad ? 
oh I see . 
Daddy took you to see another bus . 
did it stop at the bus stop ? 
but you didn't get on it . 
you just looked at it „ did you ? 
did you ? 
how close did you get ? 
nearer <and nearer> [/] and nearer .

ah nice little duck .

I'm not getting off my chair and going and picking it up . 
you'll just hafta sit there with a cold foot . 
<won't you> [<] . 
it's getting sore ? 
well [<] you should have thought about that before you threw your sock down . 
you're a silly_billy@wp .

I was thinking after lunch we might have some easter egg but &-um ducks that are cheeky to their Mummy don't get easter eggs . 
have water and biscuits ? 
yeah . 
water and dry bread . 
that's a duck's diet . 
I don't think ducks like bananas . 
but I don't really know an awful lot about ducks , Thomas . 
perhaps if somebody threw a banana into the pond they might peck at it . 
I don't know . 
oh <we went yesterday> [//] we went to see Auntie_Val and Uncle_Stuart and meet their new baby „ didn't we ? 
Abigail [//] Abigail's sister . 
what's she called ? 
Sarah ? 
it is . 
yes . 
Abigail's new sister is called Sarah . 
and we only saw Sarah for a few minutes because she was either feeding or sleeping . 
and she woke up had a little cry for two minutes and went back to sleep „ didn't she ? 
well she's a newborn baby . 
she's only a few days old . 
she's very tired .

you know we drove +/. [+ IN] 
we drove behind Auntie_Val and Uncle_Stuart in their car . 
that's right .

and there was a lot of mud and so Daddy sat you on the roof of the car „ didn't he ? 
to fasten your shoelace . 
what disappeared again ? 
did Daddy put you back on the roof when we got to the car ? 
no . 
I think he only put you on once , Thomas „ didn't he ? 
we sat another time on a bench when we were walking round the lake your shoelace came undone and we sat on a bench . 
don't think you got on the car <more than once> [>] . 
did he pull your shoe on and off ? 
well when we got back to the car after our walk your shoes were so dirty that we took them off before you go in the car . 
luckily Mummy had brought slippers with you . 
so we popped slippers on instead „ didn't we ? 
and what did we see on the boat ? 
we saw ducks and some yachts and some boats . 
and what else did we see ? 
what else did we see , Thomas ? 
ducks . 
<have you not forgotten> [//] have you forgotten the ice cream ?

she was „ wasn't she ? 
well she can't say an awful lot Abigail „ can she ? 
but she saw that her Mummy and Daddy had an ice cream and they gave her a tiny lick and she wanted some more . 
so she got a bit upset until they gave her some more . 
but we walked past +//. [+ IN] 
there was a fun fair „ wasn't there ? 
and do you remember we went to look at the dodge em cars ? 
they did crash „ didn't they ? 
but we didn't go on them . 
we didn't even go very close . 
we could just see them „ couldn't we ? 
and what else did you see ? 
what was on the roundabout ? 
the roundabout . 
what was on the roundabout ? 
do you not remember nee_na@o [/] nee_na@o ?

it was good „ wasn't it ? 
you would have liked to get on it „ wouldn't you ? 
and there was a little train as well . 
and then aft [//] after we (h)ad walked past the fun fair we saw &-um (.) I think it was [//] I'm not sure if it was a restaurant or just a shop . 
I think it was just a shop . 
but it was called Mister_Thomas's ice cream parlor . 
and next to it was a restaurant called Charlotte's . 
so we had Thomas and Charlotte together „ didn't we ? 
and then we saw the ice cream van „ didn't we ? 
and that's when <we bought> [//] we went and bought an ice cream . 
Daddy didn't want one „ did he ? 
because he's on a diet . 
but Uncle_Stu (.) Auntie_Val and Mummy and Thomas had an ice cream . 
Abigail hadta share her Mummy and Daddy's . 
but you're big enough now to have one on your own „ aren't you ? 
<you're a> [>] +... [+ IN]

that was a nice little treat for bank holiday Monday „ wasn't it ? 
you want me to move all those things ? 
you want me to clear the table ? 
you wanna play with your shop ? 
it's upstairs .

I'm just trying to quietly scrape my plate because I want this pasta sauce +/. [+ IN] 
and then +/. [+ IN]

yes . 
and then what did we do , Thomas ? 
after we (h)ad had our ice creams we went back to Auntie_Val's . 
had a drink . 
we came home . 
and on the way home we stopped at +/. [+ IN] 
where [?] did we get chips for your tea ? 
Daddy went through the drive thru at McDonalds „ didn't he ? 
did we go very quickly out of the car park and rushed home before your chips were cold ? 
what did you shout through the car window when we parked in the car park ? 
this was even before we (h)ad been to the drive thru so I don't know where you got this from . 
we arrived with Auntie_Val and Uncle_Stuart at Hollingwood_Lake and you shouted out the window “anybody want a portion of chips and a diet coke” . 
oh and you told your joke a lot „ didn't you ? 
you told your joke to Uncle_Stuart . 
what's your joke ? 
the runaway train went down the hill and she blew . 
but what's the rest of it ? 
what's the joke that you told ? 
I think your joke is that the runaway bus has been canceled but they're letting on some runaway buss instead . 
oh , Milo ? 
is it one of Milo's jokes from the Tweenies ? 
but before (.) you make this announcement you always go “bing bong attention please” .

you don't like eggs , Thomas .

well we'll have a little bit of easter egg . 
and then we'll have a tiny break while I go and get the shop and then we can play with some . 
only a small piece . 
I don't mind chocolate too much when it's at the end of a meal .

yes quack@o ? 
watch your elbows on the table , Thomas , please . 
no [/] no . 
you don't put elbows on the table . 
do you know what my father would have said ? 
all joints on the table are carved . 
and you won't know what that means . 
but your elbow is [/] is a joint . 
and a piece of roast beef or roast pork is a joint of meat . 
and anything like that on the table Granddad said would be carved with a sharp knife . 
so it useta mean if you put your elbows on the table I'll slice them off with a sharp knife . 
well knifes go on tables . 
but Mummy moves sharp knives from our table „ doesn't she ? 
she nearly leaves sharp knives lying around . 
so I'll just wipe these few crumbs up . 
what would you like ? 
a little piece of foil that the chocolate came in ? 
<there you are> [<] . 
my pleasure . 
oh why ? 
well that's silly . 
you give your Mummy work „ don't you ?

I'll have one more wipe of that and then I think we (h)ad better wipe your sticky hands „ don't you ? 
yes ? 
you'd like your sock on ? 
oh I'm sorry , Thomas . 
I didn't mean to leave it off so long . 
please don't keep taking off though . 
that's very silly . 
your foot will get cold . 
there we are . 
it was very muddy actually when we went for that walk . 
on Sunday „ wasn't it ? 
it wasn't Sunday <it was &Mon> [//] <no it was &Sat> [//] it was yesterday when we went to Val and Stuart's „ wasn't it ? 
Monday . 
that's right . 
bank holiday Monday . 
we were at Nana and Granddad's over the weekend „ weren't we ? 
bit mixed up with the days . 
yes , darling ? 
it seems funny because Daddy was at work a little bit on Friday „ wasn't he ? 
and he stayed home Saturday (.) Sunday and yesterday . 
so we're all mixed up with the days . 
I haven't a clue what day it is because when Daddy's home we always think it's the weekend . 
no . 
nicely , Thomas . 
otherwise I don't get the shop . 
come on . 
you've got to cooperate . 
oh . 
wipe that lovely little mouth . 
is it a duck's beak ?

what did we see when we went to see Auntie_Janet and Uncle_Stuart on Saturday evening ?

going towards town . 
I think it might have been advertising one of the garages , Thomas . 
I couldn't actually read it . 
it was too far away .

behind the hospital .

would you like me to turn the sound up and then you can watch it ? 
and then I'll go and get your shop . 
and then when Bob_the_Builder's finished +/. [+ IN] 
shall we play with the shop for a few moments ? 
well you watch Bob_the_Builder . 
I'll go upstairs and get the shop . 
and then when we've finished playing with the shop I think we (h)ad better go to the real shop because we need some milk . 
is that a good idea ? 
certainly not . 
you've just finished some easter egg . 
you're not having any sweets . 
no . 
we're not going to that shop , Thomas . 
no . 
it's too far away . 
Fireman_Sam ? 
is he ? 
I can't see him . 
I actually missed it „ did I ? 
the shop is open . 
right . 
well which way do you wanna be ? 
that way ? 
you're the shopkeeper „ aren't you ? 
where does your mobile phone go ? 
there ? 
oh is that where it goes ? 
your money ? 
it's here , love . 
there's your swipe card . 
you put it up there saying the shop's open ? 
right . 
whereabouts does it go ? 
on the top ? 
&-uh +... [+ IN] 
what I think I could actually do with , Thomas , is going and getting the box it came in . 
because then I can look and see where they put things . 
oh look . 
I think that's the envelope that Dimitra's card came in „ isn't it ? 
oh no it can't be . 
it just looked like Dimitra would [/] would write to Thomas with that little face on it . 
perhaps she wrote on an envelope . 
because that little card she sent us was much smaller „ wasn't it ? 
yes . 
what's this from ? 
oh [/] oh is that the ink stamp ? 
that's nice „ isn't it ? 
it goes in there „ does it ? 
there's all sorts of things in here , Thomas . 
<it's where> [<] the little ink stamp goes „ isn't it ? 
no . 
we're not playing with sweets . 
you see I'm not sure what this is for actually . 
that there ? 
oh that must belong there „ mustn't it ? 
because that's from the till . 
does it belong there ? 
or does it belong somewhere else ? 
whereabouts ? 
you're so excited „ aren't you ? 
oh_gosh . 
Thomas ! 
<I never knew> [/] I never knew that existed . 
I don't believe that . 
gosh isn't it absolutely wonderful present this . 
look at that . 
I didn't realize you could do that . 
I didn't realize that pulled out . 
now isn't that good . 
I think we oughta keep this safe . 
the key . 
somewhere else . 
<is this right> [<] ? 
yes . 
that's a sweet dispenser „ isn't it ? 
oh that really [/] really is nice this „ isn't it ? 
look at this little adding up machine . 
and the weighing scales . 
I just wish I knew where that was from . 
it (h)as obviously come from there . 
is it closed ? 
ah . 
that's a shame . 
is it ? 
oh that's jolly good actually because I could do with a carton of orange juice . 
&-um the shelves don't look very well stocked though actually , mister shopman . 
&-um . 
you look like you've got some tinned food . 
and ah perhaps there is a carton of orange juice . 
I wonder if you sell milk . 
do you think you sell milk ? 
because I could really do with a carton of milk . 
that would save me going out later on . 
nothing's in the milk ? 
you can actually buy lots_of little boxes and things in the shops „ can't you ? 
to stock up shops like these . 
in Woolworths and the Early_Learninng_Centre they have little to boxes . 
I could do +//. [+ IN] 
shall I get some Sellotape and try and mend these boxes . 
because that +//. [+ IN] 
well they're not broken but they will be broken soon if we don't &-uh (.) strengthen it . 
what is this from , Thomas ? 
please tell me . 
in there ? 
well what +//. [+ IN] 
right . 
yes . 
you look as if you're right +/. [+ IN] 
you show me because I +/. [+ IN] 
push it in there . 
what's it for though ? 
to make the shop look nice and dry ? 
I [/] I really can't work out what it would be used for . 
is it just +//. [+ IN] 
ah ! 
is it just a little table ? 
I know what it'll be . 
so that when you're doing your ink stamping (.) is that what it's for ? 
not sure really which way round it goes . 
is it that way round ? 
is it taking quite a while to set up your shop ? 
you know , dear ? 
you calling me dear ? 
like an old dear ? 
whereabouts does the mobile phone go , Thomas ? 
ah in there ? 
and where did you say this little sign (h)as got to hang ? 
oh you've posted a lot of letters . 
aren't there a lot of letters ? 
that's where the stamps go . 
actually I've got a letter to post . 
I'll post my letter . 
there we are . 
<oh is that> [<] perhaps where the +... [+ IN] 
the postman delivered my letters ? 
I've shown you where that +//. [+ IN] 
ah ! 
I found it . 
there . 
that's where that belongs . 
now all I've got to find now is <where that> [>] +... [+ IN] 
is it ? 
where [<] [/] where does it say open or closed , Thomas ? 
let's have a look round at this side because I'm looking at the back of the shop . 
whereabouts ? 
is there someplace +... [+ IN] 
oops . 
is it there perhaps ? 
no . 
up here ? 
well you show me where , love . 
because I don't know where . 
pull it down . 
right . 
okay . 
aren't you clever ? 
gosh . 
you've played with this a lot more than I have . 
it goes up there „ does it ? 
I don't know where you [/] you put it though , Thomas . 
like that ? 
oh it says it's closed . 
shall we &chur [//] turn it round ? 
right . 
look . 
this is where that key hangs „ isn't it ? 
because you don't want the key so that everybody can use it „ do you ? 
oh look . 
it says <low prices> [/] low prices +/. [+ IN] 
oh no . 
I'm not shuting the shop . 
don't you worry . 
hello ? 
is anybody there ? 
oh hello , mister shopman . 
have you got some orange juice please ? 
do you think I could possibly have some ? 
oh thank you . 
how much is that ? 
three empty francs ? 
or three english pounds ? 
what did you say ? 
pounds . 
three pounds for a carton of +/. [+ IN] 
I think you must have (.) &-uh (.) been told by your accountant to either put up your prices or shut up . 
because the last time I came to this shop you were giving things away for free . 
now it's three pounds for a carton of orange juice . 
well there you are . 
there you are . 
oh hang on . 
that's why I can't pay you . 
because (.) the shop's down . 
aren't we silly ? 
ah thank you . 
now that's not too bad . 
there's your three pounds . 
three pounds . 
and you've given me one pound and four pence in change . 
right . 
okay . 
oh now I've got some letters to post . 
I'll post that one in there . 
like that . 
now unfortunately (.) &-um (.) this one is too large to go in the postbox . 
would you possibly weigh that for me please , postman ? 
I'd like to send it first class please to America . 
it's too big ? 
well it's too big to go in the postbox . 
but I thought if I handed it in the counter you could perhaps weigh it and tell me how much the stamp would be to go on it . 
that's right . 
you're weighing it . 
<how much is> [/] how much is it , mister shopman ? 
you're folding it ? 
that's a good idea . 
why didn't I think of that ? 
instead of bothering you at the post office counter (.) I should have just folded it in half and posted it as normal „ shouldn't I ? 
now I know why you're at that side of the counter and I'm at this . 
<thank you> [>] so much . 
well the key's up here , darling . 
it's alright . 
well I shall be going now . 
I'll just pop my change in my purse . 
I needta look at the postman ? 
oh . 
see this is a bit strange . 
does this mean that I could just come in here and make a phone call ? 
oh right . 
okay . 
I shall probably ring Daddy . 
oh yes you can . 
I can ring Daddy . 
two two four six eight four four . 
well I've just dialed Daddy's number . 
he's answering . 
just a second . 
hello , Daddy .

he (h)as got some milk or some spaghetti hoops or some peas . 
he (h)as got Cornflakes (.) biscuits and coffee . 
is there anything we need ? 
just the milk ? 
I thought so . 
thank you , Daddy .

hello , mister shopman . 
I've just had a word with Daddy and it is just milk we need please . 
oh thank you . 
how much is that , mister shopman ? 
it's how much ? 
three hundred pounds ? 
well yes . 
but I needta get (.) &-um (.) well I'll probably needta take out a mortgage actually for that . 
three hundred pounds . 
are you sure you mean three hundred pounds ? 
well if I give you three pounds instead of three hundred pounds (.) how's that ? 
oh yes . 
that's fine . 
because you've given me a lot of change „ haven't you ? 
<you've given> [>] +... [+ IN] 
<you've given me> [//] I've given you three pounds and you've given me one pound +/. [+ IN] 
sixty [//] one pound sixty two change .

what I might do now , mister shopman , is just call at the stationary to get a reel of Sellotape and <I shall come back> [>] +... [+ IN]

that's a bit unfortunate „ isn't it ? 
have you seen this one before ? 
well it's on CBBC on choice you see so it's just on +/. [+ IN] 
lots_of spots . 
all different times of the day it's on „ isn't it ?

right . 
it's having a little word ? 
right . 
I've got some Sellotape and I'm just going to mend your things in your shop now . 
because I [//] they're not broken but these little <packets I think will soon be broken if we don't stick some Sellotape on> [>] . 
oh are you counting your money ? 
that's a wise thing to do „ isn't it ? 
if you're the shopkeeper . 
thank you . 
do you know what I thought about when we go out ? 
oh_gosh . 
it is on fire „ isn't it ? 
it's Granddad's birthday next week (.) on Monday . 
so we're going to hafta buy Granddad a card „ won't we ? 
mustn't forgot . 
you've got some pounds ?

these are pound coins and those are fifty pence . 
fifty pence pieces . 
thank you . 
I wonder if these came +//. [+ IN]

oh right . 
because these [//] the ones that say e@l l@l c@l The_Early_Learning_Centre [//] The_Early_Learning_Centre bank +/. [+ IN]

but I think these others (.) &-um +/. [+ IN]

well just let me finish my +/. [+ IN] 
just let me finish <mending the biscuit box> [>] . 
it's here look . 
this is the sweetie dispenser . 
you can , love . 
some Smarties ? 
okay . 
look at that little packet of biscuits . 
that's &-um (.) much stronger now „ isn't it ?

let's abandon the shop playing for now . 
right . 
off we get . 
good boy for telling me .

alright . 
well <I think it> [/] I think it would be just as helpful +/. [+ IN] 
oh . 
oh_gosh . 
he has got spots on the television that boy „ hasn't he ? 
what's the matter with him ? 
here you are . 
poorly . 
nine nine nine nine nine . 
right [>] . 
that's very clear . 
hello , Fireman_Sam , it's me Thomas_Henry . 
just calling to let you know Mummy's on fire . 
right . 
go and <sit on your> [>] +... [+ IN] 
go and sit <on your potty> [>] . 
go and sit on your potty , darling . 
well do you want your potty moving there so you can see the television ? 
or do you wanna sit here in private ? 
in private ? 
right . 
you sit down there . 
no . 
don't touch anything . 
good boy . 
tell Mummy when you're finished . 
don't touch anything . 
tell Mummy when you're finished and I'll wash your hands . 
good boy . 
right . 
we'll just have a little break I think , sweetheart . 
you're a taxi man and you're fixing ? 
what are you fixing ? 
are you ? 
well why are you a taxi man ? 
you're a fireman ? 
is he ? 
well I think Mummy (h)as mended all the cartons now . 
look . 
do they seem much more sturdy ? 
is that what there was ? 
peas +/. [+ IN] 
spaghetti hoops (.) orange (.) biscuit (.) coffee flakes ? 
because the picture's showing baked beans +/. [+ IN] 
tomato sauce . 
now did we have tomato sauce ? 
no ? 
this is what [/] what there is ? 
we haven't lost any „ have we ? 
right . 
I'll pop the Sellotape away now , love , and the scissors . 
thank you . 
are you going to do some more serving in the shop ? 
two doors . 
yes . 
there's a door for people in the shop to open (.) to buy food . 
and there's a door at the back for the shopkeeper so that he can stock the shop up with food . 
here you are . 
there you are . 
we've got some other small boxes somewhere . 
oh I don't know what the <Teletubbies's> [>] doing here . 
yes , love ? 
are you ? 
you're putting the peas on the shelf ? 
right . 
the top shelf ? 
is it like a big cupboard ? 
when you're a baby you call it a fridge ? 
well [<] it possibly is a fridge , Thomas , because if it's +//. [+ IN] 
I would have thought that if [/] if you were storing milk and orange juice in a shop +//. [+ IN] 
should we pretend perhaps that the bottom half +/. [+ IN] 
+, is a refrigerator cupboard ? 
that's a fridge „ isn't it ? 
because things like milk and orange juice and butter +/. [+ IN] 
<I think> [>] +... [+ IN] 
right . 
we'll only put the [/] the cartons of milk and juice there . 
we'll say that's a fridge and the rest is a shop . 
&-um (.) just an ordinary cupboard look (.) for flakes (.) coffee and biscuits . 
that's right . 
the tins can go up there „ can't they ? 
more tins . 
yes . 
are they too big ? 
too [<] large are they ? 
is it ? 
they're all too big ? 
all too large to go on the shelf ? 
well we managed before „ didn't we ? 
you see we've got to have it so that people can see what they're buying . 
but I would have thought that the Cornflakes and the biscuits would have been alright on one shelf „ wouldn't they ? 
will I ? 
if I put my finger in I'll get it trapped ? 
well [<] I (h)ad better move it then „ hadn't I ? 
I don't want that to happen . 
there we are . 
we'll put the biscuits there lying down . 
and the tinned food up there . 
we'll put coffee and Cornflakes on the middle shelf . 
tinned food on the top . 
and the refrigerator bit in the bottom . 
now that looks very [/] very nicely well stocked shop I think . 
what do you think ? 
I think that looks smashing „ don't you ? 
I really do . 
that's lovely , Thomas . 
it's like a real shop ? 
yes .
