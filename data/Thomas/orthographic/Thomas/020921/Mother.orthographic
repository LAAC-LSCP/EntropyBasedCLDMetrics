you heard him coming . 
running . 
drumming .

and Jo pushing the pram and Sooty running along at the side because they've taken Sooty along to the park „ haven't they ? 
for a good run round .

stop it . 
stay away . 
is that what Jo said to Sooty the dog when he came near you ? 
Sooty , stay away . 
yes . 
I don't think she wanted Sooty playing with you really because he's a lovely dog but he gets a little bit excited „ doesn't he ? 
he likes to lick you . 
what have we got here ? 
Thomas's blanket . 
what's it mean ?

but they were very cold when we came in „ weren't they ? 
you wanna read one of the books . 
well you look at the pictures and tell me what you can see while I'm changing this . 
I think Purdie's ready for coming inside again . 
what are you reading ? 
what's not very good ? 
that book you're reading . 
I think two of them are Christmas ones „ aren't they ? 
because the first one says +"/. 
+" a busy time for Postman_Pat . 
and I think that's the book where they're getting ready for Christmas „ aren't they ? 
so he (h)as got lots_of things to deliver . 
there [<] are all sorts of things going on in the village „ aren't there ? 
there's the Village_Hall to decorate and cakes and jellys and things to be made for the partys . 
and the next one is called “Christmas in Greendale” . 
and that's very much the same . 
Christmassy storys .

there were no elephants .

you didn't see little Aunty_Franks . 
you didn't see any fish like the ones you got at Uncle_David's house .

the Daddy fish has tail . 
Mummy's getting mixed up . 
that little bit of sun (h)as gone in now again . 
I was surprised how cold it was when we came back from Becky's house . 
and there was a message on the ansa [: answering] [* p:n] machine when we got in from Sonia „ wasn't there ? 
asking us if we wanted to go to the park . 
but I think what we'll do . 
get your nappie on . 
have a little drink .

and if they haven't would you like a quick run round the park with Sonia and Isabel ? 
well Daddy_Rod will be at work „ won't he ? 
like your Daddy is .

it might only be a quick shower . 
you keep kissing me .

you've had quite a busy day „ haven't you ?

would you like spaghetti Bolognese for your tea tonight , Thomas ?

we can't have sausages .

ah you're giving Mummy lots_of cuddles . 
and lots_of kiss .

let's put your slippers on now . 
they've just about dried off after you ran across the grass on the way home . 
do you remember that ? 
when we were waving goodbye to Dimitra . 
you ran across the grass „ didn't you ? 
that was naughty really „ wasn't it ? 
because you were very near the road „ weren't you ?

what's the date today ? 
is it the twenty fourth today ? 
let Mummy have a look on the calendar . 
I can't remember what day it is . 
I know it's Monday . 
oh Thomas , it's Monday_the_twenty fourth of January and I've a feeling that it might have been Christmas_Eve . 
which would have been the twenty fourth of December when we were making paper chains . 
you want a drink . 
well let's just finish reading this book and then we can get one . 
it's very hard to see . 
all the lights have gone out . 
I think that must be Postman_Pat because we can see his glasses . 
and perhaps that's Sam from the Mobile_Shop because we know he's in the Village_Hall with Pat . 
and he (h)as not got glasses . 
and then who's this at the bottom with green eyes . 
Jess . 
pussy cats have green eyes . 
have you ever seen Purdie's eyes ?

don't touch her but just look . 
green eyes [>] .

more like Jess . 
there you are . 
thank you , Purdie . 
for letting us look at your eyes . 
beautiful green eyes . 
I'll just put some biscuits on her food , Thomas . 
then I'll finish the story . 
right . 
I think we better read that little bit again . 
you wanna hold it . 
we read another story „ didn't we ? 
earlier on . 
about a Christmas tree . 
now where was that Christmas tree . 
was it at the station ? 
it was at B and Q „ was it ? 
oh no . 
it was a story about Thomas_The_Tank_Engine because the fat controller said there was going to be a party at the station with Christmas carols and a big Christmas tree . 
and he had jobs for them all to do . 
and he sent Thomas_The_Tank_Engine <to go and buy the> [//] to go and get the tree „ didn't he ? 
but unfortunately there was a very [/] very heavy snowfall . 
and what happened to Thomas ? 
he got +//. [+ IN] 
I think that's a cross between stuck and stranded „ isn't it ? 
he got stranded [<] in the snowfall . 
so Donald and Douglas had snowplows fitted to them and they set off to help clear the track . 
and then one or two other engines went and helped dig Thomas out „ didn't they ? 
an he got back just in time for them to quickly decorate the tree and then everybody arrived for the carol party „ didn't they ? 
and the fat controller said +"/. 
+" because you've done such a good job engines you can all stay . 
oh Thomas , don't do that . 
don't . 
you've done this with your other books . 
you're folding them all in half „ aren't you ? 
why are you doing that ? 
no . 
I don't know . 
but you're going to spoil them . 
Father_Christmas bought you these books „ didn't he ? 
yes . 
he wouldn't be very pleased . 
yes . 
it (h)as got a Christmas tree on it . 
that's some holly . 
Father_Christmas wouldn't be pleased , Thomas . 
if he thought you were bending the books in half „ would he ? 
he would be crying . 
yes . 
so going back to the Thomas_The_Tank_Engine story . 
the fat controller was so pleased with the other engines for helping to get Thomas out that he said as a treat they could stay and listen to the carols . 
the snake's going to sleep . 
ah I don't think you can have a sleep this afternoon , Thomas . 
you'll be too late to bed if you do that . 
are you a tired boy ? 
night night . 
shall we have a little break and a drink of milk ? 
you want some blackcurrant juice . 
okay . 
I'll organize that . 
I think it's time to get down „ don't you ? 
<there's some> [<] [/] there's some orange there . 
would you like a little piece of orange ?

orange juice . 
your drink things .

can you see it's little tongue ? 
what's it doing ? 
more like a elephant .

and what's that ? 
you know what that is „ don't you ?

ah is that a little ginger kitten ?

is it eating bananas ? 
I don't think it is . 
it's not doing anything in the picture „ is it ? 
oh a tarantula . 
that's a big spider . 
that's called a centipede . 
now you should know what that is . 
do you remember in the summer ?

these are some of Mummy's beads . 
I don't really wear them very often .

lovely . 
and a pink one .

which one have you dropped ? 
the pink one . 
well get another pink one out . 
what I thought I'd do with these scissors is snip these straws into small pieces . 
oops a daisy . 
we've got to be careful because they're going to spill all over the place „ aren't they ? 
I think Mummy's better doing the scissor things „ don't you ? 
right . 
let's cut the others up . 
a blue snake . 
is it biting Mummy ? 
this could be a necklace really „ couldn't it ? 
there we are . 
we've cut up all these little bits of drinking straw . 
lots_of straws . 
are we going to thread it like this ? 
well I don't think we can play with any more than these , Thomas . 
because otherwise when it comes to wanting a drink with a straw they'll all be damaged „ won't they ? 
look . 
is it yours ? 
your necklace . 
you're making your snake properly . 
the trouble is the wool is quite thick „ isn't it ? 
<to get> [>] through these bits of straw . 
you like little bits of straws .
