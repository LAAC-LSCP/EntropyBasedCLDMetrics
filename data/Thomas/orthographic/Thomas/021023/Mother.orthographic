Grandma and Granddad ? 
was it from Blackpool ? 
I think it was from Cleveleys „ wasn't it ? 
it was somewhere near Blackpool . 
is it ? 
oh right . 
but it was the seaside near Blackpool „ wasn't it ? 
it's where there are a lot of pebbles on the beach . 
you brought some stones home „ didn't you ? 
from the seaside . 
because we've got some in the garden that you brought before when you've been to stay . 
because you know all your windmills ? 
well all of those are in a pot secured by heavy pebbles „ aren't they ? 
that you brought home . 
there are some lovely ones there .

I'm dirty on my tummy ?

because somebody wasn't here first thing this morning . 
were they ? 
what blue caravan ? 
the blue caravan ? 
what blue caravan , darling ? 
the lady got off a blue caravan to get something ? 
she got out of the caravan ? 
oh I know what you're talking about . 
it wasn't a caravan , darling . 
it was a van . 
it was a blue van . 
she was delivering something . 
do you wanna see what it was ? 
you won't believe what it was when I go and get it . 
you just wait there .

it wasn't a sausage .

well way before Christmas , Thomas , Mummy ordered some little Christmas books for you . 
it's alright . 
it was from the book catalogue . 
they were out of stock . 
and so +//. [+ IN] 
no . 
it didn't come in a green lorry . 
so they said to me would you still like the books . 
and I said oh yes please . 
because I think they might be a little bit old for you <anyway at the moment> [>] . 
well we can look through them . 
and it isn't a blue caravan . 
it was just a blue van that the lady brought them in this morning . 
we'll keep +//. [+ IN]

this is called a Christmas kitten . 
Father_Christmas has got a kitten . 
I'll just tell you what it says on the back . 
it's the day before Christmas . [+ R] 
out in the snow the little black kitten is cold and hungry and lonely . [+ R] 
nobody seems to want him . [+ R] 
nobody seems to realize he's all alone and has no home to go to . [+ R] 
but at last he stumbles on someone who knows just where he belongs . [+ R] 
so that's a nice story „ isn't it ? 
I'm sure that's going to be +/. [+ IN] 
<and this one> [/] this one is called Christmas in Exeter_Street . 
and I do think this one is a little bit too old for you at the moment . 
I know about this book . 
it says from top to bottom the house in Exeter_Street is full to bursting . 
no . 
the gate's shut now . 
it says there's a guest in every nook and cranny and even in <the kitchen sink> [>] . 
well I think you've drunk it , darling „ haven't you ? 
do you ? 
well we're going to have something to eat in a minute .

and look . 
the last book , Thomas , is called the toy maker .

many years later Mary +/. [+ IN]

Thomas ! 
why did you do that ?

and it's not Christmas anymore . 
but still . 
you driving off with your stones ? 
oh Postman_Pat's stones .

oh is Postman_Pat asleep ? 
it must be very early in the morning if <Postman_Pat is still in bed> [>] . 
I will . 
yes . 
I wonder whether I'm going to see Postman_Pat today . 
he might have a letter for me or a parcel . 
and if he hasn't then sometimes he pops by anyway to say hello . 
I wonder if he (h)as got any stones on the back of his van . 
that would be nice if he came to show me some stones . 
I wonder if Postman_Pat (h)as been staying with his Grandma and Granddad in Poulton_Le_Fylde . 
he might have been to the beach this morning . 
because when he goes to the beach he usually collects some stones for me and some pebbles . 
it would be really nice if he had „ wouldn't it ? 
wouldn't that be lovely if he had ?

Pippin (h)as realized something's wrong . 
what was Auntie_Mabel running for ? 
well (.) Auntie_Mabel went to feed her hens and while she was outside she heard the telephone ringing .

and tugged at Auntie_Mabel's skirt . 
and she said oh , Pippin , stop it . 
whatever is the matter ? 
and then she realized there was something wrong . 
so she ran outside with Pippin and she could see the fox . 
and what did she say ? 
<shoo shoo> [/] shoo ! 
she shooed the fox away because they don't needta be near hens . 
well because foxes like to eat hens . 
and that's not very nice „ is it ?

do you feel cold ? 
you're a funny lady ? 
I'm a funny lady . 
you're a funny lady ? 
yes you are quite a funny lady .

I think you're talking about the lady on Teletubbies . 
I've forgotten her name but she does some funny things „ doesn't she ? 
did she ? 
the bear says that as well ? 
that is a funny noise „ isn't it ? 
mind you the Teletubbies make funny noises „ don't they ? 
eh oh , Po . 
what else do they say ? 
hello , Lala . 
I suppose that isn't too strange „ is it ? 
because we say things like that when we see them . 
we say hello , Lala . 
hello , Dipsy . 
but they have little songs that they sing „ don't they ? 
and they're a little bit different . 
have you ? 
is it nice ? 
tasty ? 
and don't forget if you'd like an apple just say and I'll peel you one . 
it is like a snake . 
you've pulled the piece of bread apart and it looks like a long snake „ doesn't it ? 
does it look more like a snake to you ? 
you're asking a lot more questions then you were last week „ aren't you ? 
what for , Mummy ? 
precisely . 
you're saying that an awful lot „ aren't you ? 
+" what for , Mummy .

you've got to have good table manners . 
oh you're like a dicky bird . 
you're doing what you did last week „ aren't you ? 
at the Child_Study_Centre . 
<I think> [/] I think Elaine found that very funny that you thought you were not a little bird but a little mouse going tweet^tweet@o . 
would you like a drink ? 
I've made a cup of coffee and I'm really enjoying it , Thomas . 
oh look . 
I found some more crisps in that packet . 
Thomas , look how many I've given you . 
you tired ? 
what's the matter ? 
what's the matter ? 
well I have left them there , darling . 
I haven't touched them . 
Thomas , what on earth is the matter ? 
I think you've had such a busy day and we're only halfway through . 
it (h)as all too much „ isn't it ? 
oh , darling , I haven't eaten your crisps . 
have I ? 
oh , Thomas . 
<shh shh> [/] shh . 
no . 
listen . 
Mummy picked up the packet . 
it was her empty packet as I thought . 
and when I picked it up it wasn't empty it had crisps in it . 
so I've given them to you . 
oh , darling . 
I've given you all the crisps there were . 
but there weren't many to start with . 
I've shared them with you . 
don't you ? 
oh dear . 
well I'll take them back then „ shall I ? 
give them back to you ? 
oh you look so tired . 
do you want a little sleep , treasure ? 
oh . 
I don't know what the matter is with you . 
Thomas , what's the matter with you ? 
Thomas , they're there on your plate . 
there aren't any more . 
oh come along now . 
I wish I (h)ad not given any to you if you're going to be like this . 
because you thought they (h)ad gone and you were quite happy . 
and I certainly don't give things to somebody who just says more . 
what about please may I have ? 
mhm . 
oh dear . 
I'm eating the sandwich that I made which is more than what you've done . 
I've made all those sandwiches and you haven't touched them . 
why do you needta get down , Thomas ? 
no . 
I can't eat your sandwich as well . 
Thomas , listen . 
darling , if you don't wanna eat it fair enough . 
no . 
I can't manage to eat your sandwich as well . 
<we'll just leave it> [>] . 
no . 
I can't manage another sandwich . 
we'll just leave it or wrap it up in some foil . 
<and then perhaps this afternoon> [<] +... [+ IN] 
yes . 
alright . 
perhaps this afternoon a lot later on you might be a bit more peckish . 
shh . 
alright , treasure . 
yes . 
I think we'll get you down . 
have a bit of a rest . 
oh don't you ? 
you don't sound very happy , Thomas . 
what would you like me to say ? 
I wonder whether I'll see Postman_Pat again today ? 
I doubt it because it's lunchtime now . 
in fact most people have had their lunch . 
I doubt very much whether Postman_Pat's here . 
anyway if he does come to see me there's something I'd like to show him . 
there's something I can see when I'm sitting in my chair that I've not noticed before . 
Postman_Pat's head ? 
what do you mean Postman_Pat's head ? 
&-um (.) no . 
I can't see anything . 
I can just see something I'm keeping an eye on in my chair . 
and if Postman_Pat pays a visit I'll show him what I can see . 
it's quite interesting . 
I think I can see his van . 
in fact his van's parked right outside of my house . 
but there's no Postman_Pat inside . 
Postman_Pat ? 
perhaps I'll give him a ring . 
ah here he is ! 
Postman_Pat , just come here . 
hello . 
how nice to see you . 
how are you ? 
ah you come to the window , Postman_Pat . 
do you remember last Saturday ? 
we went for a walk and it was a beautiful sunny day . 
that was before we knew anything was the matter with Granddad_Bealby „ wasn't it ? 
do you remember we went on the monkey path and we saw that very [/] very tall tree with the bird's nest in it ? 
well I was just sitting in my chair waiting for the Postman (.) and can you see over there ? 
can you see the house where the doctor lives with the children ? 
do you know the one I mean ? 
we watch them coming home from school . 
next to their house you can see the little boy Sam (.) you can see <his red car> [//] his parent's red car . 
now do you see where I mean ? 
that red car ? 
now you look above the red car . 
not up above . 
above [/] above . 
and can you see the tree with the bird's nest in it ? 
can you ? 
I don't know whether you can actually , sweetheart . 
shall I stand you +... [+ IN] 
+, up a little bit higher ? 
you look straight over there . 
do you see where I mean ? 
you're just breathing on the windows . 
that's something I did when you went to Grandma and Granddad's the other day . 
don't breathe +//. [+ IN] 
no , Thomas . 
don't . 
or I shall take you down . 
can you see it ? 
you've seen it „ haven't you ? 
I know you have now because you said there@q and you pointed exactly in the right place . 
can you see that bird's nest ? 
you just saw it didn't you ? 
so look we've got two nests to watch now . 
<and look> [<] . 
well there's one at the front . 
there's one there that we can see from this side of the house . 
and the other one we can see from your bedroom window . 
and look at the other fun thing , Thomas . 
can you see the blue sky ? 
and the sun shining through . 
now you look just above Sue's house . 
can you see all the rays of the sun coming down ? 
it looks like stripes in the sky . 
doesn't it ? 
just above Sue's house . 
can [//] do you think it looks like somebody (h)as got a paintbrush and gone boom^boom^boom@o and drawn loads of stripes in the sky ? 
Thomas , don't be silly . 
0 [=! laughing] . 
it is not Auntie_Mabel sat on a wall . 
that's Mummy having a conversation about sun rays . 
no . 
you're on something else now . 
I sing The_Archers to you . 
the them to The_Archers . 
<that's not> [<] Dumpty +//. [+ IN] 
Humpty_Dumpty say on a wall goes Humpty_Dumpty sat on a wall . 
Humpty_Dumpty had a great fall . [+ R] 
oops you've fallen off the chair . 
<oops all> [>] +... [+ IN] 
<all the kings horses> [<] and all the king's men . [+ R] 
couldn't put Humpty_Dumpty together again . [+ R] 
and The_Archers is <tum_te_tum_te_tum_te_tum@o> [>] . 
it's not it's The_Archers . 
it's not Humpty_Dumpty sat on a wall . 
now you've moved this chair I've found another stone on the floor . 
look . 
it's the very [/] very large one that looks the ostrich egg . 
and then there's a small one . 
a big ostrich ? 
it looks like a big ostrich egg that . 
it's an ostrich egg ? 
an ostrich . 
were you kissing it ? 
oh no . 
you mustn't do that , Thomas . 
<that's not kissing that's licking> [>] . 
no . 
because you got them off the beach this morning . 
good Lord above . 
you don't know who (h)as been walking on them or what (h)as happened to them . 
you don't lick them . 
oh look who's back . 
even Purdie (h)as come to see what you're doing . 
no Purdie thinks you're silly . 
she wouldn't do that . 
oh I wonder +//. [+ IN] 
well I have seen Postman_Pat today . 
because I was sitting on my chair and I saw a bird's nest and I thought if Postman_Pat comes I'll point it out to him . 
and he did and I did . 
oh I wonder if I'll see Postman_Pat again today . 
he might come back to have another look at the bird's nest . 
because do you know there are birds flying to it . 
there's a bird that keeps going back to it . 
perhaps that's the Mummy bird with some worms . 
hello , Postman_Pat . 
are you going to keep an eye on <that bird> [//] that bird's nest ? 
well there's a bird that keeps flying backwards and forwards . 
I would imagine it's the big bird gone to get some worms to feed the baby birds in the nest . 
or perhaps they're still building it and <maybe it's> [>] +... [+ IN] 
it looks more like a crocodile „ does it ? 
have you seen any crocodile nests in [/] in trees ? 
have you ? 
ah I thought you might have done . 
Purdie is not a crocodile . 
she (h)as got sharp teeth though „ hasn't she ? 
as you've discovered when you pull her tail and she (h)as gone 0 [=! makes biting noise] . 
<no she's> [<] not . 
<but please don't> [<] +... [+ IN] 
she's not . 
she's a beautiful pussy cat . 
Mummy's seeing Grandma's cat this weekend . 
oh be careful . 
what color's Grandma's cat ?

like Felix .
