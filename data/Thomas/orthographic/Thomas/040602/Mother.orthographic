it didn't look like police helicopter though . 
I didn't see him . 
I thought it looked like an army helicopter . 
it was dark green . 
<I don't> [<] know . 
the police helicopters do . 
but the police ones are white . 
and blue and red and they look like police cars in the sky . 
but that one was dark green . 
it sounded quite loud „ didn't it ?

put your pants on . 
come on . 
quick .

even people that know you , Thomas . 
they're private . 
you don't start showing things like that to other people . 
it's private . 
that's why you wear pants . 
keep your bottom cold . 
to catch drips . 
and to keep them private . 
no [<] . 
you don't . 
it's rude . 
I'll tell you now . 
if you go out . 
and start doing things like that . 
you'll get in serious trouble . 
the policeman will come . 
and they'll lock you in jail .

the police wouldn't let you out . 
full stop . 
it's private . 
don't show it . 
okay ? 
okay . 
<now listen> [<] .

nobody should ever ask to see [/] see those bits either , Thomas . 
if you're having a bath and Mummy dries you or Daddy dries you or Nana and Grandad . 
or if we're getting you dressed but that's the only time . 
you don't show them . 
you don't talk about them . 
okay ?

we can hear that little girl with the red bucket . 
well . 
not the red bucket . 
the bucket over there . 
no . 
well . 
it's letting a bit of air in . 
yes . 
but it's locked . 
nobody can get in . 
it's just (.) it's called a ventilation &-uh thing , Tom . 
I can open it a little bit and I can lock it . 
so that nobody else can open it from the outside . 
just lets a tiny bit of fresh air in . 
is this xxx [>] . [+ PI] 
oh . 
yes . 
it could let insects in . 
they probably wouldn't come (be)cause they can't see it's open . 
but when you're in bed at night . 
it can get terribly hot in here when the door's shut . 
(be)cause it's only a small room „ isn't it ? 
do you ? 
I think the desk in the spare room is better really . 
yeah . 
oh . 
well . 
the red one's Daddy's desk . 
you couldn't play at Daddy's desk because he's got all his computer equipment on it . 
he wouldn't be very happy „ would he ? 
if he got his work spoilt . 
well . 
he does , Thomas . 
you xxx . [+ PI] 
if you go in there and make mess . 
who's got to tidy it up ? 
yes . 
don't mind you going in there .

slippers . 
there we are . 
do they feel comfy still ? 
why ? 
no . 
you [//] Thomas . 
you haven't even put it on . 
why do they hurt [>] ? 
(be)cause they can't hurt (be)cause they +/. [+ IN] 
they can't hurt . 
they can't hurt because they're big enough . 
and you chose them . 
you actually chose those slippers . 
I bought all the others for you . 
the only thing is . 
is I like the ones you sort of put your foot in and wrap the velcro strap round . 
right . 
sit back please . 
yes . 
do you like those ? 
they were but [>] +/. [+ IN] 
don't [<] be silly [>] . 
Thomas [>] . 
it won't hurt . 
it'll hurt more if you move it . 
that didn't hurt „ did it ? 
no [<] . 
no . 
they were very big when you got them . 
they were a present „ weren't they ? 
I think they're alright now . 
you've got two pairs of slippers . 
and where would we put all those ? 
you wouldn't have time to play with them all . 
no . 
leave the door . 
well . 
I'm sure you could play with what you've got . 
you've got quite a lot of emergency vehicles „ haven't you ? 
you haven't got quite so many now with loud sirens „ have you ? 
sorry ? 
yeah . 
I'm sure Daddy checks that before he gets any . 
0 [=! chuckles] . 
0 [=! chuckles] . 
Daddy'd probably just take the battery out . 
he did that with something „ didn't he ? 
a while ago . 
do you remember ? 
he did . 
yes . 
thing is though . 
when Daddy's watching the news . 
and he asks you could you be quiet . 
you don't . 
so that's what happens . 
he gets very cross . 
then he takes the battery . 
he's only done it once . 
let's brush those beautiful golden locks . 
your little hair . 
looks nice . 
ooh . 
it smells beautiful . 
when you've just had it shampooed „ doesn't it ? 
right . 
do you not want me to read that little book to you ? 
no ? 
there we are . 
beautiful , Thomas . 
right . 
watch you don't trap your fingers in the hinge otherwise . 
you'll need one of those &-uh ambulances that you're talking about . 
a double one . 
hurt your fingers . 
right . 
what's that sign say ? 
danger ? 
did you write it yourself ? 
you've drawn a [/] a big red circle . 
oh . 
I thought you'd done the circle . 
right . 
Daddy must've drawn a big red circle . 
on a white piece of paper . 
you put a cross in the middle „ have you ? 
and does that mean danger ? 
keep out ? 
that's your bedroom . 
aah . 
do you not want Mummy in your bedroom ? 
okay . 
right . 
yeah . 
alright . 
and a cross . 
okay . 
but I can't just barge in without knocking . 
checking first . 
okay . 
that's fair enough . 
it's your +/. [+ IN]
