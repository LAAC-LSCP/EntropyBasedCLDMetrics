oh no . 
you're not having lemonade at breakfast , Thomas . 
pardon ? 
no <you don't> [>] . 
well I've just put them away . 
you're going to have breakfast now . 
no [/] [<] no . 
you can play with your toys later on , Thomas . 
no . 
if you have lemonade it's as a treat . 
no [/] no . 
you can put your police helmet on if you like . 
yes . 
you like that „ don't you ? 
no . 
you're not having crisps at breakfast either . 
don't start , Thomas . 
not to start asking for sweets and crisps . 
I think you'll find chocolate mice and pink pigs are sweets . 
and when you're talking about little crocodiles and big snakes (.) or little snakes and big crocodiles (.) they're jelly sweets you've had in the past . 
so <no no> [/] no . 
I don't think so . 
would you like your police hat +/. [+ IN] 
+, Thomas ? 
my ticket ? 
oh yes . 
that's a till receipt „ isn't it ? 
<I (h)ad forgotten> [<] it ? 
is it the receipt for Purdie's bed ? 
oh yes it is . 
yes . 
we bought Purdie a bed „ didn't we ? 
in the shop . 
well Purdie's old now and she likes to sleep a lot „ doesn't she ? 
goodness me [>] . 
well Thomas is holding the till receipt (.) and you're pretending it's a letter that you're reading out . 
because you started off by saying “all you're saying is Dear Dora (.) Pippin has left her suitcase” . 
and then you got [//] went on to say (.) and fireman this and policeman that . 
and you even mentioned Isabelle's christening „ didn't you ? 
Isabelle's was christened <months and months ago> [>] . 
so you're pretending to read a letter „ aren't you ? 
you're talking a lot about Daddy_Rod (.) Isabelle and Sonia . 
are you reading a letter that somebody sent to you ? 
mhm . 
we've got some letters here that the postman (h)as brought . 
dear Dora . 
Purdie (h)as spilt her drink ? 
oh . 
the boy in the chemist has spilt her drink ? 
what shop , darling ? 
Mothercare ! 
oh ! 
I know what you're talking about . 
it wasn't Mothercare it was British_Home_Stores . 
but yes (.) I do know what you're referring to now . 
just let me have a sip of that juice to check it's alright . 
there you are . 
yes . 
we went into British_Home_Stores (.) the other day . 
and there was quite a queue at the till . 
and <there was a &fam> [//] there was a family in front of us . 
a little girl who I would say is a little bit older than you . 
and her Mummy and Daddy . 
and there was a little boy in his pram who wasn't a baby (.) but he wasn't as old as you . 
and he was crying „ wasn't he ? 
crying . 
and he looked really hot . 
and his Mummy and Daddy thought he needed a drink . 
and when his Mummy picked up his juice xxx said “oh you can't have anymore juice” . [+ PI] 
+" you've drunk it . 
and then she went to rearrange his blankets because he was hot (.) and they were absolutely covered in orange „ weren't they ? 
and then she realized instead of drinking his juice (.) the top must've come off and he (h)ad spilt it all over his blanket . 
so (.) he was thirsty (.) he hadn't drunk his juice . 
that's why he was crying . 
and was also wet because his blankets were covered in juice . 
so he was a very unhappy little boy „ wasn't he ? 
he was . 
you've folded up the letter „ have you ? 
<you want> [<] to see what's in it ? 
what about an ambulance being a little surprise ? 
or a little prize ? 
hm: [=! laugh] . 
you're putting the till receipt round your beaker of juice now . 
do you think that will help you not to spill it ? 
oh ! 
I know what you're doing again now . 
you're hiding one of those ice pop things . 
those things that are like ice lollies (.) but they're in a long plastic tube . 
only a very small one . 
and it's a little bit cold for you too hold (.) so we wrap the bottom in some kitchen paper for you so that you could hold it . 
and it wouldn't feel too cold on your hands . 
oh no . 
you can't have one of those . 
listen (.) there's a letter here . 
it says “dear Missus_Lastname” . 
this summer +//. [+ IN] 
it's from Clarkes (.) the shoe shop people . 
you're still talking about the boy spilling his drink . 
+" dear , Missus Lastname . 
this summer we have developed a new range of <stylish and fashionable sandals> [>] . 
listen . 
which are ideal for Thomas . 
it's [//] it goes on to say “leathers that will keep Thomas cool whatever the activity” . 
oh (.) here we are . 
and you're mentioned again at the bottom .

I hope you agree that this season we've got a range of sandals that Thomas will look and feel good in .

I think we've had one of these catalogues before . 
right . 
those are nice . 
how about those ? 
<did the man> [<] +... [+ IN] 
oh yes . 
they're nice „ aren't they ? 
the man put those on your feet in John_Lewis but the [//] they not fit (.) you had a problem ? 
mhm . 
yes you do have rather a problem if your shoes don't fit . 
well I like those . 
but are those the ones that the man tried on you ? 
you like those blue ones ? 
do you ? 
you love blues ? 
train blue ? 
oh I think you're talking about a different blue . 
you're talking about <the run away train went down the hill and it blew> [=! singing] . 
whoo^whoo@o . 
that's a different sort of blue , Thomas . 
that's blew as in blow . 
little boy blue . [+ R] 
come blow up your horn . [+ R]

the run away train <went down the track> [>] . [+ R] 
<you need> [>] +... [+ IN] 
you need what , love ? 
you need your &tre [//] Tweenies tape ? 
oh yes . 
I think the tape that Jake_Jimmy bought you for your birthday (.) the Teletubbies tape (.) that has the runaway train on it „ doesn't it ? 
one of the songs (.) is the runaway train . 
oh now what have we got here ? 
this is a letter from Sainsburys .

what's this ? 
is this a little place mat ? 
that's nice „ isn't it ?

that's a banana . 
we've got +//. [+ IN] 
it's showing this white clean place mat (.) which looks very nice . 
no . 
they're not yoghurts . 
they're eggs . 
eggs in egg cups . 
I can see why you thought they were yoghurts . 
because somebody has drawn smily faces on the eggs and you're thinking of the fromage_frais@s:fra . 
and the little pots have faces on . 
it's showing a number one [>] +/. [+ PI] 
yellow number one (.) with a banana . 
a red number two (.) with two +... [+ IN] 
apples . 
a sort of browny orange number three <showing three> [>] +... [+ IN]

not pears . 
they're called +//. [+ IN] 
you won't have seen them like that . 
because you don't like boiled eggs . 
and it's showing a number four in blue with four fish . 
they're nice „ aren't they ? 
and the number five showing one two three four five peas in a pod . 
so let's see what else they're telling us . 
that's number eight . 
it's another leaflet that (h)as come with this (.) and it says eight outstanding offers . 
it's showing number eight . 
well afterwards . 
I just wanna have our breakfast nice . 
this is very strange because we joined this nought to five club years ago and we never heard a thing . 
suddenly we've got this letter this morning saying “dear Mister_Lastname , thank you for joining Sainsburys nought to five club” .

they must have just found the application form .

I think we'll send the voucher for the &na [//] Huggies nappies and the baby food to Auntie_Val . 
she might like that . 
do you think ? 
or Jo . 
<Auntie_Val (h)as xxx > [<] . [+ PI] 
something scary on there ? 
it's a tiny crumb , Thomas . 
I don't think it's that scary . 
it's not very nice I admit .

would you like Rice_Krispies or <Cornflakes or cereal bar> [>] ? 
<or apple> [>] . 
you've got to eat something . 
don't ask for sweets (.) you're not getting them .

yes . 
would you like that ? 
you want something from the freezer ? 
ah (.) I'm not meaning the ice lollies .

that is not what I mean . 
<cheeky monkey> [<] .

when I mentioned the freezer (.) this is what I had in mind . 
they're not actually (.) they're sultana and syrup scotch pancakes .

are they nice , Thomas ? 
what do you say ? 
please ? 
thank you . 
<well I've made some> [//] well not made (.) poured some Rice_Krispies in a bowl and put milk on them . 
because that's what you asked for when I was having Cornflakes . 
but when you (h)ad seen the Cornflakes you're having those instead „ aren't you ? 
I'm eating your Rice_Krispies . 
this is the last of the Rice_Krispies , Thomas . 
when we go to the shop I'll hafta buy some more . 
when we go to the supermarket we'll hafta buy some Rice_Krispies .

I don't know which one we'll go to . 
which two supermarkets do we go to ?

no . 
you're not having a fizzy drink . 
there's some nice juice . 
you can have that . 
it's spicy juice . 
you like that „ don't you ? 
did you not see it there ? 
oh I'm sorry , love .

we saw the ducks .

<and it had> [//] well it had one or two toys and things in it . 
not toys &-um (.) how we can describe them ? 
sports [/] sports things I would say more than toys . 
because when you go to school you'll be a lot older than you are now . 
they had some lovely little picnic tables . 
very low tables and chairs . 
they had benches . 
beautiful flower tubs . 
it looked a nice playground „ didn't it ? 
but they had (.) on the pole a big plastic (.) I don't know how you describe it . 
it [/] it was made from yellow plastic (.) red plastic or blue plastic „ wasn't it ? 
three big looking tubes on a big pole . 
and it looked to me as if it was a sort of net ball basketball thing . 
I would imagine that from the playground you can throw a ball into the air and try and get <it one of the> [/] one of the three plastic buckets at the top of the pole . 
and then the ball will fall straight through . 
oh dear . 
<be careful> [/] be careful .

there's absolutely nothing apart from a drink of milk and maybe an apple . 
for [>] your breakfast and lunch . 
you can have your usual drink of milk (.) and you can have an apple mid morning . 
but nothing else . 
you're not having any sweets .

the steeple and the clock ? 
I see . 
no . 
it hasn't got a clock „ has it ? 
our church clock isn't working at the moment „ is it ? 
it just says four o'clock all the time . 
not heard it chiming . 
they're doing a lot of repairs to the church roof though „ aren't they ? 
what can we see from [/] from outside ? 
lots_of scaffolding . 
that's right . 
and the church clock seems to have stopped at four o'clock . 
&wh [//] which man ? 
Reverand_Tims ? 
he's called Marcus . 
Marcus_Maxwell . 
Reverand_Tims is in Postman_Pat .

he's a nice man „ isn't he ? 
he (h)as got some boys . 
they're older than you .

yes . 
they put it on „ don't they ? 
is that what they do ? 
they [/] they give people so many minutes „ don't they ?

do they count down ten nine eight seven six five four <three two one> [>] . 
stop cooking .

does it pop ? 
<does it> [>] . 
right . 
big blue fire engine ? 
well I'm not quite sure what it is you're talking about . 
I'll hafta watch it . 
it sounds a bit dramatic . 
no wonder they feel sick . 
I think I'd feel sick if I was in a hot air balloon and it popped , Thomas .

you would feel a big sick „ wouldn't you ? 
just looking to see if Sue (h)as gone to work today .

well she's not very well . 
she (h)as got a poorly heart .

most of the time she's alright .

because Sue hasta take tablets . 
you know how <Nana and Granddad> [>] +... [+ IN] 
is it hot ? 
you know how Nana and Granddad take tablets ? 
well Sue hasta take tablets . 
so if she has something like a tummy bug (.) and she can't keep her tablets inside her tummy (.) then it makes her very poorly . 
well you keep going on about things being hot . 
and I actually said heart . 
what's hot ? 
your Cornflakes are hot ? 
oh_gosh . 
well if they're so hot (.) we (h)ad better cool them down . 
let's blow on them .

oh I see . 
you're doing what Fireman_Sam would do on something hot . 
you're pouring water on it . 
hey what's happening there ? 
yeah . 
but listen [/] listen . 
you tipped your beaker up then and your juice is coming out . 
it's not sposta do that . 
it's an any way up cup . 
you're sposta put it any way up . 
no . 
you're not to do that , Thomas . 
it's going everywhere . 
so what else are they telling us at Sainsburys ? 
isn't it strange how they've (.) never written to us before . 
that's right . 
little eggs . 
<I had an easter egg> [//] <I got an easter egg> [//] a boiled egg the other day and you didn't like it „ did you ? 
you don't seem to like eggs and it's a shame , Thomas , because +/. [+ IN]

I'm sure you like Easter eggs .

there is an exception to every rule „ isn't there ? 
and you've seen eggs [//] a program about eggs on Auntie_Mabel „ haven't you ?

she went into the hen hut „ didn't she ? 
and collected the eggs . 
and Pippin +/. [+ IN] 
oh did Pippin break one ? 
oh that sounds like Pippin . 
and she picked <some hens &-uh> [//] some eggs „ didn't she ? 
and then she put it a pan with some boiling water or perhaps it was cold water . 
I don't know . 
but anyway she cooked it in a pan . 
and you can have eggs all different ways . 
you can have them poached or fried or scrambled . 
you can have egg sandwiches (.) egg mayonnaise (.) egg salad . 
lots and lots <of things> [>] . 
you think you'll have one for your tea ? 
we sing this song with Julian about eggs „ don't we ?

I want one for my tea . [+ R]

lay a little egg for me . [+ R] 
the aeroplanes sound loud this morning „ don't they ? 
<no no> [/] no . 
<no no> [/] no &be [//] don't tip your juice up . 
it's coming out of the top .

no , Thomas . 
you shouldn't be using your spoon to bang . 
it's too eat . 
no . 
if you keep banging that I'll take it off you . 
shh [/] shh . 
you can put your police helmet on . 
yes . 
there you are . 
did you say “thank you , dear” ? 
&=laughs . 
thank you , dear . 
&=laughs . 
as long as you don't call me an old dear , Thomas , I don't mind . 
it's alright . 
because it sounds like you're saying “oh dear” . 
<oh dear> [/] oh dear . 
when you were a very [/] very small child (.) you useta say “oh dear [/] oh dear” . 
oh dear . 
all the time . 
everytime something happened “oh dear [/] oh dear” . 
oh dear . 
right . 
you going to wear this helmet ? 
oh I see . 
you're using your helmet as a ticket machine „ are you ? 
you're posting your spoon underneath . 
are you going to eat this ? 
you like this . 
what's under there , Thomas ? 
listen . 
that spoon has got milk on it . 
so don't keep putting it in there . 
mhm [<] . 
<well I've never seen> [<] a ticket machine quite like that before . 
actually (.) do you know what the top of the helmet looks like ? 
that looks like an egg in an egg cup „ doesn't it ? 
some rubbish . 
no . 
it's just dirty rubbish in a plastic bag . 
no . 
you've been using your potty . 
oh yes . 
I remember now . 
mhm . 
you've been very good with your potty though „ haven't you ? 
was it when Mummy was on the telephone that you disappeared behind the settee ? 
now the dustbin is just round the corner . 
go out the patio door and round the corner (.) near the gate . 
there's a light when it's dark . 
it's hard to see because we've got an outside light at the bottom of the house (.) but it shines on the patio in the garden . 
so at night (.) when I've any rubbish I just put the bag outside (.) and <then I move it> [>] in the morning . 
I'm sure if it was very dark that the dust(b)in wagon man would put his flashing lights on . 
but the dustbin wagon doesn't come out at night „ does he ? 
no . 
he doesn't . 
<look thing> [>] +... [+ IN] 
mhm . 
thinking about it though (.) in winter they useta come a lot later than then come now . 
and so it was usually quite dark in the afternoon when he came . 
and he would have his lights on . 
they tend to come between lunch time and tea time . 
well sort of one o'clock and two o'clock (.) around lunch time . 
it was always between four and five „ wasn't it ? 
we'll hafta see if they keep coming early . 
it's easier to see what they're doing when it's light . 
but it was easier to see <when they were coming> [//] when they were arriving when it was dark . 
because we could see the lights in the distance . 
now they just suddenly appear „ don't they ? 
does your mouth hurt , love ?

you're just checking it „ are you ? 
you're just checking your teeth „ are you ?

do you now wanna wear your helmet ?

who (h)as been saying dear@q to you ?

it's not something Mummy says .

have you heard that on television ? 
excuse me ?

Auntie_Mabel not got a deer ? 
well when Auntie_Mabel's writing to [/] to somebody like when Auntie_Mabel wrote to Dora (.) she wrote “dear , Dora” .

the cupboard that we useta have there that (h)as gone to Sister_Eileen's house . 
yes . 
some men came and collected it „ didn't they ? 
yes . 
well you were sad because your cupboard went . 
because you useta play with that cupboard „ didn't you ? 
with all the boxes . 
I think you're probably too large now to go in the cupboard . 
you're too big . 
oh yes . 
you're Mummy's baby . 
and you're still a little boy but you're possibly too big to crawl into that tiny space in the cupboard . 
that's right . 
when the doors were shut I couldn't see you in the cupboard . 
I useta think “where's Thomas [/] where's Thomas” . 
and you'd go oh ! 
open the doors and there you were . 
so can you see the dial on there ? 
well on a very [/] very cold day you can turn the dial +/. [+ IN] 
so that it makes the radiator hotter and the house warm . 
but in the summer we might not want any heat at all (.) so we could turn it off . 
or if we just want the radio [//] the radiators on very low (.) we can adjust the [/] the temperature of the house . 
no . 
you mustn't press the button . 
no [/] no . 
you're +... [+ IN] 
are you +//. [+ IN] 
you're either telling me when you're a big man . 
or you're pretending to be a big man and you wanna press the longrey@c bell . 
now the longrey@c bell (.) we discovered is your word for alarm bell „ isn't it ? 
meaning fire alarm . 
you (h)ad better go ? 
I've just realized , Thomas , all the daffodils have died in our garden „ haven't they ? 
oh (.) how sad . 
well they don't last very long daffodils . 
but usually in March (.) we have really [/] really strong winds that scatter all the daffodils . 
and this year I don't think we had strong winds . 
and they've actually managed to stay upright this time . 
but they've just died on their own . 
we're now quite into April „ aren't we ? 
I don't even know what the date is . 
pardon ? 
what's died on the road ? 
oh dandelions . 
yes . 
well we've still got dandelions . 
we've &=laughs always got dandelions . 
we grow a really nice crop of weeds „ don't we ? 
yes . 
no (.) some of the neighbors have &-uh (.) dandelions and daffodils still . 
but our daffodils have gone . 
I don't even know what date it is , Thomas . 
I know it's Thursday . 
oh look who's here . 
it's Purdie . 
hello , Purdie . 
right . 
let's have a look at the calendar . 
<see what date we're up too> [<] . 
no . 
not a chocolate calendar . 
just the ordinary calendar . 
the chocolate calendar was at Christmas . 
the advent calendar . 
and then you had one that counted down to the millenium . 
right . 
April (.) where <are we> [>] ? 
oh_gosh (.) it's the thirteenth . 
oh ! 
hafta watch out today . 
no . 
listen [<] . 
you wanna stroke Purdie ? 
&-um (.) oh_gosh [>] . 
we've got +//. [+ IN] 
listen Jake [>] +... [+ IN] 
I will . 
I'll pick her up in a second . 
Jake_Kelly's coming today . 
Jake and Georgia are coming to play with you . 
Jake and Georgia with the yellow car ? 
oh you're thinking of Abigail and &-uh (.) Francis played with your yellow car „ didn't they ? 
Jake and Georgia . 
and what's their Mummy called ? 
can you remember ? 
Geraldine ? 
right . 
Purdie's here . 
hello , pussy cat . 
Dad [//] Thomas wants a little word with you . 
have you definitely finished your breakfast ? 
because if you touch Purdie you can't start eating that toast again . 
let's move that . 
ah . 
I think Purdie needs a good brush actually , Thomas . 
I don't brush her as often as I useta . 
let me just pull this chair up next to you . 
no . 
we can't put Purdie on the table . 
no . 
Mummy'll just hold her in her arms . 
you can talk to her . 
ah . 
oh , Thomas . 
don't be telling Purdie you've got an ambulance for her with flashing nee_nas@o . 
because you know very well that she doesn't like the noise . 
not near Purdie . 
no . 
no [<] you've got a lot of noisy toys now , Thomas . 
with sirens and things like that . 
and I'll tell you right now (.) have I got your full attention ? 
you're such a cheeky face . 
I haven't even said anything to you and you look full of devilment . 
you do not press the siren on toys when you're near Purdie . 
it's not a little man doing it . 
it's you . 
Purdie [<] gets frightened . 
treat her gently . 
no . 
not her tail . 
come on . 
what's that rhyme we know about Purdie ? 
the gentle one . 
I love little pussy . [+ R] 
her coat is so warm . [+ R] 
and if I don't hurt her (.) she'll do me +... [+ IN] [+ R] 
no harm . 
are you listening now ? 
so I'll not pull <her tail> [>] . [+ R] 
nor drive her away [>] . [+ R] 
and pussy and I very gently will +... [+ IN] [+ R] 
play . [+ R] 
I love little pussy . [+ R] 
her coat is so warm . [+ R] 
and if I don't hurt her (.) she'll do me harm . [+ R] 
so I'll not pull <her tail> [>] . [+ R] 
nor press on her back . 
<nor drive her> [>] +... [+ IN] 
you're just carrying her in your arms ? 
so I'll not pull <her tail> [>] . [+ R] 
nor drive her away [>] . [+ R] 
pardon ? 
what's better ? 
this pussy cat ? 
and pussy and I very gently will play . [+ R] 
yes . 
oh she's a beautiful pussy cat „ isn't she ? 
oh look , Purdie . 
0 [<] [=! laughs] . 
look , Purdie , Thomas has stuck his spoon in his beaker . 
perhaps that's why it's leaking now . 
and he says he (h)as made a big church spire and a clock . 
and the clock's saying bing^bong@o . 
bing^bong@o . 
bing bong . 
right , pussy cat , would you like some breakfast now ? 
what do you think Purdie would like to eat for breakfast ? 
salmon ? 
oh I bet she would . 
I bet Purdie would like salmon for breakfast like you'd like sweets for breakfast . 
oh dear . 
she's going to be sadly disappointed . 
it's Whiskas I'm afraid , Purdie . 
would you like some Whiskas , sweeties ? 
chicken food ? 
we call Purdie a chicken „ don't we ? 
what's warm ? 
her teeth are warm ? 
her teeth are inside her mouth „ aren't they ? 
does she eat spiders ? 
incey_wincey@wp spiders ? 
mhm . 
well I've no spiders for you , Purdie . 
oh she's lovely . 
let's go and give her some food . 
oh look . 
there's food here , Purdie . 
oh she must not have eaten that in the night . 
there you are , darling . 
there you are . 
she's eating that quite happily „ isn't she ? 
right . 
I (h)ad better wash my hands now . 
<oh she [/] she wants some> [<] &-uh (.) I think she wants a few biscuits on top . 
there you are , puss . 
there you are . 
no . 
don't be silly with that beaker , Thomas . 
I've got to wash my hands . 
when you've touched Purdie you always wash your hands before eating food . 
in fact you've always got to wash your hands <before you eat food> [>] . 
right . 
let's take that away now . 
<have you> [<] finished with your Cornflakes ? 
would you like a pancake ? 
well let Mummy finish her piece of toast first . 
and then we'll get the ambulance . 
you wanna drive it round and round „ do you ? 
be careful , Thomas , please . 
when Mummy (h)as finished this toast we'll wash your hands and face and then it's time for upstairs and have your teeth brushed . 
and get you dressed for the day „ isn't it ? 
what would you like to wear today ? 
something ? 
anything in particular ? 
I can't get over how loud the aeroplanes are today . 
oh [<] ! 
be careful . 
don't poke your eye . 
no . 
it'll hurt . 
oh don't , Thomas . 
no [/] no . 
it'll hurt you , sweetheart . 
no . 
I'm not looking at you . 
I don't like <seeing you do that> [>] . 
what are my eyes called ? 
eyes . 
&=laughs . 
what are yours called ? 
blue ? 
ah ! 
I see . 
no mine are blue . 
yours are brown . 
Purdie (h)as got green eyes . 
yes . 
what color eyes has Daddy got ? 
no . 
Daddy hasn't got green . 
Purdie has green . 
Mummy has blue . 
you have brown . 
Daddy has +... [+ IN] 
brown like yours . 
or yours are like Daddy's . 
yes . 
does it ? 
you're playing with my engagement ring now . 
does it hurt you sometimes ? 
mhm . 
actually , darling , I don't think the engagement ring usually hurts you . 
but (.) I'm not wearing it today but usually or quite often Mummy has an eternity ring on that finger . 
and that (h)as got a lot of diamonds and sapphires . 
a lot more than the engagement ring . 
I think it's the [//] that ring that hurts you . 
sometimes when I'm getting you dressed or doing things with you it scratches you „ doesn't it ? 
tickles you . 
you needta get down ? 
oh no . 
we've got to go to the shop this morning . 
and we've got Jake and Georgia coming . 
well this afternoon . 
at lunchtime in fact they're coming . 
and then when they've gone +/. [+ IN] 
we'll do something this afternoon . 
I'm not quite sure what . 
but <we'll do something> [>] +... [+ IN] 
Thomas Lastname ! 
your life doesn't revolve around sweets all the time . 
have you +/. [+ IN] 
have you heard this little boy , Purdie ? 
isn't he a Tinky_Winky ? 
he's a cheeky monkey „ isn't he ? 
I thought you said potatoes were called Tinky_Winky . 
do you mean Teletubbies ? 
which is your favorite Teletubby ? 
Tinky_Winky ? 
I thought it always useta be Po ? 
Tinky_Winky now „ is it ? 
Father_Christmas bought you a Tinky_Winky „ didn't he „ at Christmas ? 
he's up there . 
would you like me to get him for you ? 
oh no . 
he's not in the loft . 
he's hanging on the toy chain (.) under the stairs . 
we've got all your soft toys clipped with little pegs onto a special chain . 
the toy chain . 
tell you what , Thomas . 
you've got a lot of toys in your bedroom . 
soft toys . 
from when you were a baby . 
yeah . 
but I don't really wanna get rid of them because you still play with them „ don't you ? 
we've got a toy hammock „ haven't we ? 
we could put that up . 
because every time I go to make the bed or hoover (.) I've got to move massives of little creatures [//] furry creatures before I can do any jobs . 
you [<] [/] you help ? 
yes you do help „ don't you ? 
mhm . 
you're Mummy's little helper . 
you're a good helper actually , Thomas . 
aren't you ? 
you're a clever boy . 
have you taken your bib off ? 
I know . 
I don't think you really need bibs now „ do you ? 
it's just force of habit . 
I think I tend to put one on because very often you're dressed up ready to go somewhere . 
and then we eat (.) and I think oh ! 
if you've got a bib on (.) you're going to keep nice and clean . 
where am I going ? 
I'm just going to check the time . 
yeah . 
she's just through here , Purdie . 
right . 
let's give you a +/. [+ IN] 
hands and face a quick wipe . 
well I don't think you can see her from where you're sitting , Thomas . 
she's [/] she's actually sitting right near your bicycle . 
I think she might be going for a ride in a minute . 
in the bicycle trailer ? 
yes . 
you'd like that „ wouldn't you ? 
<for you> [<] to go down the street riding your bicycle with Purdie sitting in the trailer . 
there's a little birdie in the garden . 
can you see it , Thomas ? 
near the clothesline ? 
it's pecking on the grass . 
it's a sweet little thing . 
I think it (.) oh you can't see from there . 
I think it might be a wren . 
it's a tiny bird . 
I've not seen one like that for a long [/] long time . 
and we've not had robins in the garden like we useta . 
when Mummy and Daddy first moved into this house we had a family of robins . 
and they came back year after year . 
and I think perhaps we've only seen one (.) in the last few weeks . 
robins tend to stay in the same place . 
so I don't know what (h)as happened . 
pardon ? 
yes . 
they sleep in the trees . 
perhaps they sleep under the trees . 
you don't really see birds asleep „ do you ? 
but they must sleep somewhere . 
certain birds have nests „ don't they ? 
yes [<] . 
sleep [<] in birds nest . 
you call them bags of toys „ don't you ? 
do you remember that Saturday ? 
that was about the time Granddad had a stroke . 
it might have been (.) the same day or perhaps the week before we went for a walk . 
and we were talking about bird's nests . 
and I was pointing out bird's nests in the trees and you were saying it was a bag of toys . 
I shall always think of bird's nests being bags of toys , Thomas , from now on . 
the only thing is (.) if they are bags of toys is they're so high up in the tree (.) I don't think you'd be able to climb up to reach them „ would we ? 
pardon ? 
you would if you climbed the [//] a tree . 
especially like the one you say is a bag of toys round the corner . 
it's such a tall tree . 
and the nest is right at the top . 
you would fall down . 
do you remember seeing all those magpies ? 
when we go for a walk sometimes near the pond +/. [+ IN] 
not the pond with the swans on (.) but the pond with the ducks and the Canada geese . 
we see (.) lots and lots_of magpies . 
in one tree we counted about twenty two one day . 
do you remember ? 
last night Ben and Charotte ? 
the red car ? 
oh it wasn't last night . 
you're talking about quite a few weeks ago , Thomas . 
you're quite right it was +//. [+ IN] 
in fact it was the day you started being poorly (.) with that tummy bug . 
because we (h)ad been to toddler group and we (h)ad gone straight from toddler group to Sonia's and Isabelle's for lunch and you didn't wanna eat lunch . 
then on the way home (.) we were walking home when we decided to go to the pond and see the geese and the ducks . 
and (.) we were looking at them and Ben and Charlotte and Linda drove past in a car „ didn't they ? 
and they stopped and talked to us . 
and they said that they were taking the pussy cat to the vet . 
what was her pussy cat called ? 
Tiger . 
they were taking Tiger to the vet's „ weren't they ? 
and then +/. [+ IN] 
that's right . 
not many minutes later they drove past again . 
they drove back again „ didn't they ? 
well when we saw them I think they were actually going home to pick the pussy cat up . 
put her in her basket (.) and then when we saw them the next time they were actually driving +... [+ IN] 
+, back to the vets „ weren't they ? 
with the pussy cat . 
well I [/] I think their pussy cat is possibly quite old like Purdie . 
and I think it has a problem with (.) it's thyroid gland . 
<you need> [>] +... [+ IN] 
you needta check them ? 
well look . 
in the bread box now we've got hot cross buns (.) lemon and sultana pancake . 
and carrot and cinnamon and raisin bread . 
now put them back in the box please . 
no , Thomas , you don't play with food . 
put them in the box and then we can get the lid on . 
okay . 
right . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
and one more . 
that's lovely . 
thank you . 
we'll pop those away now . 
we've taken those little pancakes out of the freezer so (.) they're defrosting now . 
apart from the one in the bread box . 
and we can have them later „ can't we ? 
how's that ? 
Purdie ? 
I think she might have gone upstairs now , Thomas . 
we've just given you a wipe „ haven't we ? 
did we use the towel to dry you down ? 
let's just get those few crumbs (.) off the table . 
that's it . 
your police helmet is down there (.) look , love . 
on the floor . 
I think you must have dropped it . 
right . 
you're free to go . 
that's breakfast over with . 
did you enjoy that ? 
didn't eat an awful lot „ did you ? 
you've had plenty . 
no . 
she's not in the back of the trailer . 
I think she (h)as gone upstairs .
