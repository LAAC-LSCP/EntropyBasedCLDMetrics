Grandpa . 
Grandpa .

Grandpa . 
I think Ben says Grandad as well actually . 
Grandpa is like the book „ isn't it ? 
we have a storybook . 
do you remember ? 
that's right . 
it talks about Grandma and Grandpa . 
it doesn't stay Grandad „ does it ? 
Grandpa . 
what are you busy doing , Thomas ? 
you wanna see what's in this box „ don't you ? 
some paper . 
look in Mummy's box . 
she (h)as got some paint . 
are we going to do some finger paints ? 
in a minute . 
you're drawing first on that paper „ are you ? 
what are you drawing ? 
you're drawing Linda Brian Jo Sooty and man . 
do you know what the man's called that lives with Jo ? 
it's Tony . 
Becky's Daddy's called Tony not man . 
so if you're drawing a picture you can draw Jo . 
that's the Mummy . 
Tony . 
that's the Daddy . 
and Becky the baby . 
and what's the dog called ? 
called Sooty . 
that's right . 
that's beautiful . 
this looks like a fish . 
this green picture here . 
what's that ? 
a fish .

oh that's beautiful . 
where've we been today ? 
to Sonia's house .

you're drawing a fish . 
well that's a lovely fish . 
it looks like a whale but it's gorgeous . 
Rod .

oh you're drawing Sooty . 
oh dear . 
what (h)as happened to the pencil ? 
the red one (h)as gone . 
has it broken ? 
thank you . 
you can still draw with it . 
you've got two to draw with now . 
you could have one in each hand . 
one in your right hand and one in your left hand . 
which hand +/. [+ IN] 
oh no . 
it was one that was broken in two so you've got two halves . 
oh dear . 
have you dropped one on the floor ? 
well use a different colored pencil , Thomas . 
look . 
there's all these pencils . 
look at all those . 
do you not want one of those ? 
oh dear . 
you're still drawing a picture of Sooty „ are you ? 
a big one . 
you're drawing Thomas . 
and you're drawing a mouse . 
a baby one . 
a tiny mouse . 
is the mouse coming through <the skirting board> [//] a hole in the skirting board ? 
do you remember on the program with Aunty_Mabel and Pippin +/. [+ N] 
that's right . 
it showed a tiny mouse „ didn't it ? 
no . 
the mouse wouldn't bite Pippin . 
no [/] no . 
because in actual fact what happened is Pippin barked and the mouse was frightened and it ran back into the hole in the skirting board „ didn't it ? 
let me show you . 
here . 
look . 
this is the skirting board at the bottom of the wall . 
and we haven't got any mice here . 
but Aunty_Mabel had a mouse that lived behind there . 
and it chewed a little hole in the wood and came out „ didn't it ? 
and then Pippin barked at it and it ran back in . 
what did we see at Isabel's house today ? 
because after bang^a^drum^time@c we went to Isabel's house . 
because Sonia was having a book party „ wasn't she ? 
and we ordered some books for Christmas . 
we had lunch there but we went into the garden to play . 
and what did we see ? 
you've just drawn a picture of a mouse . 
that's lovely . 
what did we find in Isabel's garden ? 
what was it ? 
can you not remember ? 
a tiny frog . 
it had a poorly leg „ didn't it ? 
it looked like one of it's back legs had been squashed and it could jump with great difficulty . 
but it was a tiny thing „ wasn't it ? 
and what did Sonia and Isabel do with it ? 
no . 
they didn't touch it „ did they ? 
they just let it go quietly „ didn't they ? 
behind the sandpit . 
are you going to draw a picture of the frog ? 
that one . 
that's a lime green one . 
oh what a good picture [//] color to choose for a picture of a frog . 
it's sort of a greeny color that „ isn't it ? 
not really a lime green . 
more a khaki green . 
that's an excellent choice for drawing a picture of a frog . 
pardon . 
what a@p color ? 
are you trying to get pencils out of the pot ? 
there you are . 
tip them out . 
no . 
a@p can't . 
I think you can if you put your mind to it . 
xxx , Thomas . [+ PI] 
I can see an orange light and a green light working . 
they weren't before „ were they ? 
oops oh dear . 
tip it out . 
oh [/] oh . 
oh no . 
don't draw on the pot . 
just draw on this pad . 
who gave you the pad (.) to draw on ? 
you're whispering . 
I can't tell what you're saying . 
Nana and Grandad brought it . 
no . 
they didn't . 
it was Uncle_Stuart . 
when we went to see Uncle_Stuart and Aunty_Janet . 
they were doing some drawing with you and when you were leaving Uncle_Stuart gave you a big writing pad . 
look at this . 
are you describing all the colors of the pencils you've got ? 
you've got a lot if pencils „ haven't you ? 
an orange one damaged . 
it is damaged „ isn't it ? 
oops a daisy . 
yes . 
I think what (h)as happened the point of the crayon (h)as been broken „ hasn't it ? 
two brown pencils . 
two browns . 
you're putting them back in the pot . 
you've had enough now . 
the blue paint . 
we've lost the blue paint „ haven't we ? 
we [/] we bought a long time ago a packet with three finger paints in it . 
a yellow one a blue one and a red one . 
and we useta use the blue one an awful lot . 
it's missing . 
the blue one's missing . 
you're quite right . 
and now we can only find the yellow and red . 
but when we went to stay in the Lake_District last November we took the blue one with us to do some finger painting there . 
and I'm wondering +/. [+ IN] 
yes . 
I'm wondering whether we left it there because we've not seen it since „ have we ? 
you think it (h)as all gone in the binbag lorry . 
do you think it (h)as been thrown out by mistake ? 
it might well have been . 
so instead of having blue paint Mummy (h)as got an ink stamp here . 
an ink stamp with blue ink . 
do you know that size of ink pad it's only very small „ isn't it ? 
but when you were a baby I put your foot on that and made some prints with your foot . 
so your foot must have been very tiny (.) because we can't even get your whole hand on the pad now . 
hold it . 
well shall we (..) get this nice card ? 
and we'll do some finger painting . 
you can do a nice card for Elaine . 
and we'll do a nice card for Peter . 
not for your Daddy . 
for Peter_Watkinson . 
because he's +/. [+ IN] 
no . 
he lives at the hospital . 
but he's not poorly . 
he's a Doctor „ isn't he ? 
and he hasn't managed to buy a house yet so he's living in some rooms at the hospital and he said it's a little bit bleak . 
so I think what we'll do is we'll do a picture with some nice cheerful handprints on . 
yes . 
and he can put them on his wall „ can't he ? 
I think we'll put the light on . 
now shall we start with red paint ? 
no . 
ah .

we can make nice cards [//] greeting cards .
