and they look at little bits of white paper . 
and then they look at some bubbles . 
from bubble bath in the bath „ don't they ?

<you've found him> [<] „ have you ? 
with your torch ? 
you found him . 
oh perhaps he didn't see you . 
he (h)as only just pulled up . 
oh it's making Alice bark . 
oh that looks like a new dustbin man „ doesn't it ? 
that's the man who normally waves to you . 
no . 
he's not looking today . 
but I think it's because he (h)as got somebody new with him , Thomas . 
perhaps he's having to concentrate on telling the new man what to do . 
can you see ? 
look out of this window . 
that's right . 
they've parked in a different place „ haven't they ? 
yes . 
it's just that perhaps +//. [+ IN] 
it's raining outside . 
so he maybe hasn't got a lot of time . 
he doesn't wanna spend a lot of time outside . 
and he looks like he's busy telling the new man what to do . 
oh he must be in a good mood . 
because those people haven't put their rubbish in a black bin bag . 
and they've just left it on the floor in a box . 
and he (h)as thrown it in the back of his lorry . 
usually they say “it's not in a black bin bag we're not taking it” „ don't they ? 
Auntie_Peggy wants to get past ? 
yes . 
and there's somebody +//. [+ IN] 
it's Christopher's Daddy that were driving in the opposite direction . 
now the man's sorting them both out „ isn't he ? 
are we going to be able to see when they press the button do you think ? 
now where are they going ? 
where are they stopped now ? 
Sue's house ? 
yes . 
he (h)as dropped one „ hasn't he ? 
oh the poor new man's only doing one bag at a time . 
but the older man's doing about three „ isn't he ? 
bye bye . 
yes . 
they've taken Sue's rubbish . 
yes . 
they've taken Sue's away . 
that [//] that's the new bag that they've left on the door handle . 
oh (a)nother one's dirty . 
no . 
it's a new bag , darling . 
that [/] the one you can see on the door handle . 
look . 
the one that you can see on the tree . 
they're brand new bags . 
so Sue'll be able to put that in her dustbin bag „ won't she ? 
&-uh sorry the dustbin . 
so that next week they can take that away full of rubbish . 
there [/] there's still that one in the road that (h)as been blowing about . 
I don't know who that belongs to . 
so that's it for another day . 
well we're going for a walk now . 
and where we're going they've already collected the rubbish . 
they got their rubbish before coming here on Berwick_Avenue „ don't they ? 
mhm . 
it's a pity that they don't collect after us because we're going out now . 
we could have seen them all again „ couldn't we ? 
but on Friday when we got to music class we see the [/] the lorry picking up the rubbish on Kingsway „ don't we ? 
when we're in Didsbury . 
and that's always very exciting . 
another dustbin man coming ? 
well on Friday when we're going to the music class we can see people in Didsbury having their rubbish emptied „ can't we ? 
you wanna get your cars ? 
well can I just give you a couple . 
while Mummy's getting ready to go out ? 
which ones would you like ? 
a lot of ones ? 
well I've hadta put the light on so +/. [+ IN] 
don't throw your torch down . 
it'll break ! 
well how about a break down truck ? 
because we've just been talking about a breakdown truck „ haven't we ? 
and the snow plough . 
and the tipper truck . 
you've taken your socks off now . 
there you are . 
policeman . 
snow plough . 
breakdown truck . 
and dumper truck . 
how's that ? 
yes ? 
and Mummy's going to go now and get ready to go out for our walk . 
and remember we've got to have all these toys tidied away „ haven't we ? 
before we can go . 
the policeman's looking for naughty boys „ is he ? 
I hope he doesn't find any round here , Thomas . 
I don't think he will „ do you ? 
because you're a good boy „ aren't you ? 
oh yes . 
they're looking for somebody naughty „ aren't they ? 
but you're not a naughty boy . 
no . 
Thomas isn't naughty . 
someone's naughty . 
yes . 
who's naughty ? 
I've just remembered , Thomas . 
before all the excitement of the dustbin man you asked for a drink of milk . 
and it's here . 
look . 
there you are , sweetheart . 
there you are . 
there's your drink . 
I'll leave it there for you . 
the big digger ? 
I've just put the <big &dig> [//] big digger away . 
okay . 
it's the window ledge not a window sledge . 
you're getting mixed up between window sill and window ledge . 
sledge is something that you slide on in the snow . 
a sledge or a sleigh . 
jingle bells . 
that's right . 
yes . 
Father_Christmas came on a sleigh „ didn't he ? 
on Christmas day ? 
well it was Christmas eve he came . 
we saw him a couple of nights before Christmas . 
just checking where you lived „ didn't we ? 
but then he actually came on Christmas eve . 
to leave lots_of presents for you . 
pardon ? 
what's the matter ? 
the digger's digging up somebody out ? 
right . 
I'm going to pop upstairs now , Thomas . 
and get ready to go out . 
so we'll have a little break . 
we're having a look at Christmas cards „ aren't we ? 
have you got all the Christmas cards out ? 
oh yes . 
thank you . 
oh . 
look . 
look at this card . 
it (h)as got some rabbits . 
little monkey climbing up a ladder ? 
it's actually a Mummy rabbit . 
and three baby rabbits . 
and they're decorating a tree . 
the Mummy's holding a big string of beads . 
there're two &rab [//] bunny rabbits on the floor looking at a box of Christmas baubles . 
and look . 
this rabbit (h)as climbed up the tree . 
and he's hanging baubles on the top . 
and the card says for Mummy . 
with lots_of love at Christmas . 
from Purdie and Thomas . 
written in gold pen . 
isn't that beautiful . 
yes . 
I think you can have a lot of fun with these old Christmas cards actually . 
the sunshine (h)as gone ? 
I know . 
it (h)as quite late now „ isn't it . 
it's quite windy as well , Thomas . 
now what's this a picture of ? 
xxx . 
a church like your church ? 
well this is Yorkminster . 
what the ground ? 
do you know why ? 
because the snow's falling . 
you wanna go in Father_Christmas's sleigh ? 
what do you mean ? 
yes . 
well somebody (h)as walked across the snow . 
because can you see footprints ? 
yes . 
what other cards have we got ? 
look . 
there's one here with a candle on it . 
this is funny . 
the next card I've picked up is written in gold as well . 
everybody (h)as been writing in silver and gold this year . 
Daddy did his cards in gold . 
Mummy did hers in black biro . 
very quickly . 
because Mummy's like that . 
oh you're posting them now „ are you ? 
I think you can have a lot of fun with these . 
because you could play postman with them . 
and we can look at the pictures „ can't we ? 
together . 
that's Father_Christmas . 
and we can look inside to see who they're from . 
that's fancy „ isn't it ? 
Santa (h)as got something in his hand ? 
oh he (h)as got a lantern . 
he's holding up a lantern . 
and he's shining it onto a little wall . 
what do you think he's saying to the little boy ? 
oh it's a little girl „ is it ? 
do you think that's what he's saying ? 
hello , little boy . 
now I've shone my lantern on you I see you're a little girl . 
no . 
ah . 
what that is that's Ruldolph and Father Christmas are pulling a Christmas cracker in front of the snowman . 
and it (h)as gone bang@o ! 
pop@o ! 
and that's a flash . 
we didn't have Christmas crackers this year . 
we had them last year . 
&-um I think you would have enjoyed them this year . 
we didn't really think about it . 
that's a nice card „ isn't it ? 
you posting them all ? 
you're posting them through the slot ? 
I can see a badger . 
there's a badger . 
there's another one . 
it's like a snake „ is it ? 
where's the snake ? 
yeah . 
I think actually , Thomas . 
that's grass and coals covered in snow . 
but yes . 
I quite agree . 
it does look like a swirly snake „ doesn't it ? 
two badgers . 
guess what ? 
written in silver . 
oh that's from Jake_Jimmy . 
that's your friend Jake . 
it's Becky (.) Paul and Jake . 
Becky (h)as written her name in silver . 
and she's written Jake's name in silver . 
and Paul (h)as signed his in blue biro . 
ah . 
this is a nice card . 
it's a teddy bear surrounded by presents . 
and there's a picture of a squirrel . 
what's the squirrel doing ? 
you've posted it . 
<is it> [<] ? 
it's too big to post ? 
and what have we got on this picture ? 
two foxes . 
they look like baby ones . 
perhaps they're fox cubs . 
you know how the squirrel has got a big bushy tail ? 
can you see the squirrel's big bushy tail on this card ? 
well you can't see it on this picture . 
but foxes have big tails . 
they're called brushes . 
they're little berries . 
no . 
we don't eat them „ do we ? 
giraffes eat them ? 
do they ? 
oh . 
get many giraffes around „ do we ? 
do we ? 
oh right . 
you want a digger ? 
your yellow one ? 
to collect all the cards in ? 
okay . 
I'll get it for you . 
there you are , Thomas . 
look . 
I found an empty book of stamps as well . 
we'll pop that in the digger . 
well no . 
I didn't think it would really , darling . 
because the cards are really quite big compared to the digger „ aren't they . 
it's too small ? 
you'll try that one a minute ? 
just fits . 
if you take the digger man out it fits in the cab „ doesn't it ? 
do you know what the digger could be useful for , Thomas ? 
clearing all the snow on this Christmas card . 
shall we go through and find all the cards with snow on . 
and the digger can see if it can dig it's way out . 
to make a +//. [+ IN] 
use it as a snow plough . 
can you see a teddy bear on this card ? 
standing on the bannister ? 
you wanna dig the snow ? 
that's right . 
where are you moving the snow too ? 
ah . 
this is a very small card . 
it might actually fit in the digger . 
does it ? 
no . 
it's still a bit too big „ isn't it ? 
look . 
there's another one snow . 
it's a picture of a church with snow around it . 
and the foxes are surrounded by snow . 
and what else ? 
ah . 
Winnie_The_Pooh and piglet . 
they've got snow in the end . 
and this little boy and a girl sitting on a swing . 
they have snow around them . 
and who's this ? 
this is a very important person standing outside of Holly cottage . 
and he needs snow moving otherwise he won't be able to get through „ will he ? 
who's that ? 
I know . 
oh and here he is again . 
look . 
lots_of snow on that card . 
and all these +//. [+ IN] 
I tell you what , Thomas . 
I feel a bit cold just thinking about the snow . 
chilly „ isn't it ? 
I shall go and put the heat on in a moment . 
you want me to sit down ? 
okay . 
next to you ? 
here ? 
are you cold ? 
pardon ? 
you're cold in the summer ? 
I think you mean you're cold because it's winter . 
in the summer you were very [/] very hot . 
do you not remembering wearing t+shirts and shorts ? 
and swimsuits . 
and some days you didn't wear anything „ did you ? 
when you were running around . 
and now you've got warm socks and jumpers . 
and long trousers . 
and when we go out what do you hafta put on ? 
you don't know ? 
what do we put on when you go outside ? 
a coat ? 
and what about your hat (.) scarf and gloves ? 
that's right . 
you dropped your glove last week at bang^a^drum^time@c „ didn't you ? 
at the music class . 
and the lady picked it up for you . 
it was your mittens on a string „ wasn't it ? 
did you say thank you to her ? 
good boy . 
that's nice of you . 
this is a pretty card . 
did you say mind , Daisy ? 
oh who you saying “mind , Daisy” ? 
Grandma's called Daisy . 
I'm Daisy „ am I ? 
well it's my Mummy that's called Daisy . 
that's it . 
you've moved that „ have you ? 
you've moved the digger round ? 
it's a bit frothy ? 
it's a bit frothy ? 
what do you mean by frothy ? 
Mummy's a bit frothy ? 
what's frothy ? 
I don't really understand you . 
I'm sorry . 
do you think the digger man's cold ? 
shoveling up all this snow ? 
I think he could do with a nice hot cup of tea . 
or some nice warm soup „ don't you ? 
what do you think he'd like , Thomas ? 
a biscuit . 
that's what you need ? 
would he ? 
well we'll see what we can do .
