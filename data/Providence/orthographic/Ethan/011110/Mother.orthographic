let's put all the play+dough back . 
plus , if you leave it out it gets dry and yucky . 
where's the top ? 
where's the top ? 
you wantcher [: want your] bottle ? 
now where's Scuffy ? 
Scuffy the tugboat . 
Scuffy was sad . 
Scuffy was grumpy . 
Scuffy sniffed his blue smokestack . 
the toystore is no place for a red painted tugboat , said Scuffy . 
he sniffed his blue smokestack again . 
I was meant for bigger things ! 
he's in a [?] toystore . 
perhaps you would not be grumpy if you went sailing , said the man with the polka+dot tie . 
there he is ! 
who owned the toystore . 
so one night he took Scuffy home to his little boy . 
he filled the bathtub with water . 
I won't sail in a bathtub , said Scuffy . 
a tub is no place for a red painted tugboat . 
the next day , the man with the polka+dot tie and his little boy carried Scuffy to a river . 
sail , little tugboat , said the man with the polka+dot tie . 
it was full of water ! 
come back , little tugboat , come back ! 
not I , tooted Scuffy , not I . 
he keeps going . 
all that day , Scuffy sailed along with the stream . 
past cows , and women washing clothes ! 
Scuffy almost got hit by a cow ! 
that was not fun . 
night came , and the moon came out . 
there was nothing to see but the quiet trees . 
suddenly an owl called out . 
hoot , hoot ! 
toot , toot ? 
cried the little tugboat . 
he was scared . 
he wanted to see the man with the polka+dot tie . 
the next morning , Scuffy moved on . 
to make a big river . 
Scuffy sailed down the river . 
he sailed past men with logs . 
what're [: what are] they doing , Ethan ? 
they're gonna get the logs ready for the logging truck . 
this is a fine river , said Scuffy , but it's very busy and big for me . 
he sailed under some bridges . 
the river got deeper and wider , and now there were big cities . 
and big boats . 
the river got deeper and deeper and deeper , and it moved faster and faster . 
then , it started to rain , and Scuffy was riding on the waves . 
lots and lots and lots_of rain . 
people had to bring cranes and put sand bags by the river +... 
(be)cause the river was getting bigger and bigger and bigger , and higher and higher and higher . 
and there's Scuffy , all alone . 
on went the river to the sea . 
at last , Scuffy sailed into a big city . 
here the river got wider , and there were docks , and wharves , and big ships . 
and cranes loaded freight onto some ships . 
Scuffy said toot , toot . 
but nobody saw him , the little tugboat . 
oh no , said Scuffy when he saw the great big ocean . 
there's no beginning and no end to the sea . 
I wish I could find the man with the polka+dot tie , and xxx +... 
yep [: yes] , it goes all the way to the dock . 
just then , just as the little red tugboat sailed past the last piece of land , a hand reached out +... 
that's Scuffy again . 
but look who picked him up . 
who picked him up ? 
the man with the polka+dot tie , and the little boy . 
and he said , I wanna go home to the bathtub . 
that's just the right size for me . 
the end . 
and there's the little red engine +//. 
I , think I can . 
I think I can . 
a coal car , yes he does . 
that's right ! 
and who else ? 
and there's Scuffy again . 
and we know that story , too ! 
what was his name ? 
the tawny , scrawny lion . 
and there's a +//. 
kitty+cat . 
it looks like Chuffy . 
Chuffy was a steam engine . 
the name sounds the same . 
I don't know where your Chuffy book is . 
you predict what will happen ? 
way to go , Ethan ! 
you didn't predict that I predicted it . 
you remembered it already ? 
that's the top of the school . 
it has a bell , to call the children in . 
after they're playing outside +//. 
and here's the gate ! 
mm , which side goes up ? 
ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ! 
that's so the , other trains don't cross the track when the train is coming through . 
mhm ? 
up , down , all around . 
baby kittens . 
baby kittens leans forward and backward on the rocking+horse , to make it go up and down . 
bayoup@o bayoup@o ! 
there , you put it back . 
there you go ! 
yeah , you clicked it . 
clickety+clack .
