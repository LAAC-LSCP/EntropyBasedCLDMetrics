that's the one you wanted , right ? 
hm: , 0do you wanna [: want a] story ? 
this one , or this one ? 
xxx , which one is this one ? 
or , better view for Gordon ? 
you were saying it yesterday . 
what did the box say ? 
xxx . 
Cranky was unloading a box for Sir Topham Hatt . 
the box was marked , urgent ! 
humph@o , creaked Cranky , what's so urgent about this package ? 
Thomas heard Cranky's question . 
if it says urgent , we should get it to Sir Topham Hatt as fast as we can , he said . 
I'll take it . 
just then , Gordon pulled up next to Thomas . 
an urgent package needs a speedy train , said Gordon , I'm +... 
yup [: yes] , he doesn't have it any more . 
it must be on the docks here . 
I'm the fastest train here , so I will have to take the package . 
Gordon took the package and set off immediately . 
Thomas was left behind ! 
I could have gotten it there quickly , he peeped . 
Gordon hurried down the track and took a hilly shortcut . 
suddenly , he saw a red signal . 
some rocks had fallen across his path ! 
he was stuck ! 
just then , Toby came by on an open truck . 
help , said Gordon ! 
I'll take it down the hill , said Toby . 
thank you ! 
Gordon called as Toby chugged away . 
Toby clickety_clacked@n quickly down the hill . 
what's that ? 
what's that , Ethan ? 
Percy was waiting at the bottom . 
thank you for bringing the urgent package down , said Percy . 
Sir Topham Hatt will be very proud of me , Percy tooted as he hurried along . 
Percy rounded a bend and saw James ahead of him , pulling two troublesome trucks . 
James was going very slowly , because the trucks had their brakes on . 
they were trying to stop James . 
they wouldn't go until they took the package . 
Percy was very mad . 
but he knew that the urgent package had to get to Sir Topham Hatt quickly . 
with a sigh , xxx , he gave it to the trucks . 
no more trouble from you , trucks , said James . 
the trucks released their brakes . 
James and the trucks quickly left Percy behind . 
was Thomas listening to the story too ? 
James was glad he would be the one to deliver this urgent package now . 
James was going so fast , he almost didn't see +... 
what is it , Ethan ? 
the broken track ! 
now Sir Topham Hatt will never get his urgent package ! 
I'll take the urgent package , said Harold , landing next to James . 
Harold soared over the countryside . 
he looked down , and saw Thomas pulling in , into Tidmouth station . 
Thomas had been faster than Gordon after all ! 
where's my package , Sir Topham Hatt said . 
just then , Harold landed . 
I have it , sir , he said . 
and he told Thomas and Sir Topham Hatt what happened . 
finally , Sir Topham Hatt opened the urgent package . 
it's a shiny new hat ! 
just in time for tonight's big party , Sir Topham Hatt said , putting the hat on his head . 
and Thomas , next time there is an urgent package +... 
I want you: to bring it ! 
which one ? 
Thomas the tank engine , rolling along . 
he is the one , he is the one . 
Thomas we love you . 
yep [: yes] . 
I'm a little choo_choo train , chuggin(g) down the track . 
now I'm going forward , now I'm going back ! 
and then we know , engine engine number nine +... 
that's Douglas , that's right ! 
or Donald . 
engine engine number nine , going down Chicago line . 
jump , the track ! 
do you want your money back ? 
will you get your money back ? 
yes , no , a maybe so . 
yes , no , a maybe so . 
it's a design , an(d) what's that , Ethan ? 
an(d) what's this design ? 
when engineers get hot , they use this to wipe their face . 
that's why they carry a kerchief . 
it's called a kerchief . 
remember , we read about a handkerchief ? 
xxx , I don't know . 
that's right . 
so they can wipe their faces when it gets hot . 
or wipe their +//. 
(be)cause sometimes you get dusty when you drive a train . 
your pants are falling down , huh ! 
0it looks like Cranky's [: Cranky is] holding up the name of the book , an(d) the name of the book is , the special delivery ! 
that's cute . 
he's holding up the name of the book . 
that's the urgent package . 
are you sleepy today ? 
xxx ? 
you got up very early . 
0do 0you wanna read another one ? 
up , out of the way , so you can relax , Max . 
I mean Ethan . 
I mean Max . 
I mean Ethan . 
he looks , what does he look , there ? 
tired ? 
shall we read this one , too ? 
Toby and the flood ? 
it had been raining hard for weeks . 
Toby was feeling miserable . 
everywhere was +... 
wet . 
wet . 
wet . 
that's a dam . 
an(d) the water's coming through . 
it's like a big wall , an(d) the water is pouring through . 
only the great wall , known as a dam , was stopping the water from overflowing . 
Percy arrived just as Toby was about to expect the dam for any damage . 
driver tells me it may be dangerous up there , careful Toby ! 
I'll try , said Toby bravely . 
Percy watched anxiously as Toby trundled away . 
there he goes , over that bridge . 
the river surged dangerously beneath it . 
just like in the +//. 
the , &-um , what story ? 
about the tugboat . 
Scuffy ! 
Harold the Helicopter was inspecting the dam as Toby arrived . 
be brave , Toby , called his driver . 
the dam did not look safe at all , and Toby was worried . 
it broke . 
the dam's breaking up ! 
Toby shunted back as fast as his wheels would let him . 
the river had risen so high that the bridge was in danger of collapsing . 
the dam's breaking up , we must find high ground ! 
shouted Toby's driver . 
your only chance is to cross the bridge , called Toby . 
called Percy . 
Thomas , look at it break up like that , an(d) the water's rushing through . 
it's our only chance , said his driver . 
we'll be +... 
Toby was halfway across when disaster struck . 
we'll follow him on our line . 
as Toby floated helplessly in the flood waters , they passed a sign that made them shudder . 
what does it say ? 
if we go over that waterfall , we're +... 
then they saw Harold , who slooped , xxx +//. 
you're a tired little pumpkin today , huh ? 
let's see . 
and they did . 
just then , Percy arrived . 
Harold flew over to him . 
catch the rope and pull Toby to safety ! 
he called . 
an(d) he's attached to a rope . 
oof . 
when the floods were over and the dam mended , the villagers had a big party for Toby , hosted by Sir Topham Hatt . 
you were very brave , Toby . 
oh , I'm sure you would be . 
Percy rather hoped he would never have to ! 
what story's this ? 
Gordon was feeling grumpy . 
why are you complaining all the time ? 
because I'm a big engine and I know everything . 
I shall complain whenever I want . 
I can't see any , said Percy , where are they ? 
any what ? 
like your smoke+box , Percy ! 
laughed James . 
one day I'll show you just what a big engine can really do . 
not speak to silly little green +//. 
then he puffed away . 
later that day , Sir Topham Hatt came to see him . 
Gordon , you'll be making one stop today , with an empty express , to test our new station . 
you can make up time afterwards . 
why can't Henry do it ? 
you will do as you are told . 
so Gordon did , but he was still unhappy . 
an(d) he grew sick , too ! 
Gordon was sick ! 
he's making a funny face . 
I can't do it , xxx . 
do I look like Gordon ? 
xxx , you look funny too ! 
I just can't get up to speed , he moaned . 
your pipes are clogged , said the fireman . 
at last , they approached the new station . 
Gordon was impressed , but his mood soon changed . 
in front of him was a blank wall an(d) huge buffers . 
what a boring view ! 
important engines like me should have a panoramic view , where I can see people and people can see me . 
and he weeshed@o angrily , xxx . 
weesh@o ! 
Gordon was happy when it was time to leave . 
now you can really enjoy your run , as long as your pipes will let you , said his driver . 
come on , come on , I can go faster than this , puffed Gordon . 
sick ? 
but Gordon began to feel more and more feeble . 
that means weak . 
what happened ? 
his driver and his fireman inspected him . 
now you really will have to go to the works . 
Gordon was still angry when James arrived to collect his cookies . 
well , well , well ! 
you got too puffed up in your boiler , so it serves you right . 
serves you right , serves you right ! 
when Gordon returned from the works a few days later , he was still boasting . 
I am the finest engine on the island of Sodor . 
probably the finest in the world ! 
come on , Gordon , we're going to the new official opening of the station . 
then there was trouble ! 
as Gordon approached the station . 
the driver reduced steam , but Gordon was still going too fast ! 
help me , please ! 
well , Gordon , said Sir Topham Hatt , I knew you wanted a panoramic view , but this is not the way to achieve it . 
what did Gordon say ? 
when Gordon was repaired again , he took Sir Topham Hatt to the new station for its second official opening . 
this time he arrived safely , an(d) everyone clapped and cheered as he pulled in . 
you don't wanna finish the story ?
