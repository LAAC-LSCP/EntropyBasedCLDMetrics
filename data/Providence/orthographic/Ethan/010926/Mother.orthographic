yeah , probably . 
wanna sit on my lap ? 
dyou [: do you] remember ? 
he found a button . 
there he is , there's a picture of him . 
right ? 
what's he doing ? 
Corduroy is a bear . 
who once lived in the toy department of a big store . 
day after day , he waited with all the other animals and dolls for somebody to come along and take him home . 
what's there , there's a giraffe , and a doll +... 
bunny+rabbit , and a +... 
the store was always full of shoppers buying all sort of things . 
but noone ever seemed to want a small bear in green overalls . 
then one morning a little girl stopped and looked straight into Corduroy's bright eyes . 
there's the very bear I've always wanted ! 
not today , dear , her mother sighed . 
I've spent too much already . 
he's lost the button to his overalls . 
Corduroy watched them sadly as they walked away . 
I didn't know I'd lost a button , he said to himself . 
tonight I'll go and see if I can find it . 
what did he do ? 
late that evening , when all the shoppers had gone and the doors were shut and locked , Corduroy climbed carefully down from his shelf and began searching everywhere on the floor for his lost button . 
suddenly he felt the floor moving under him . 
quite by accident , he had stepped on an escalator , and up he went . 
could this be a mountain , he wondered ? 
I think I've always wanted to climb a mountain . 
is it a mountain , Ethan ? 
no , what is it ? 
he stepped off the escalator as it reached the next floor . 
and there , before his eyes , was a most amazing sight ! 
tables and chairs and lamps and sofas +... 
and rows and rows of +... 
this must be a palace , Corduroy gasped . 
I guess I've always wanted to live in a palace ! 
he wandered around , admiring the furniture . 
Bob wants to read the story ? 
I've always wanted to sleep in a bed . 
and up he crawled , onto the large , thick mattress . 
all at once , he saw something small and round . 
what did he think it was ? 
what did he think it was ? 
why , there's my button , he cried , and he tried to pick it up . 
he yanked and pulled with both paws until +... 
off came the button , and off the mattress Corduroy toppled . 
bang , into a lamp . 
over it fell with a crash ! 
Corduroy didn't know it , but there was someone else awake in the store . 
the night watchman was going on his rounds on the floor above . 
when he heard the crash , he came dashing down the escalator . 
now who in the world did that , he said . 
somebody must be hiding around here . 
he flashed his light around sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all . 
and there he saw two fuzzy brown ears sticking out from under the cover . 
who was it ? 
who's that hiding ? 
how did you get upstairs ? 
and the watchman tucked Corduroy under his arm and carried him down the escalator . 
and put him on a shelf in the toy department with all the other animals and dolls . 
Corduroy was just waking up when the first customers came into the store in the morning . 
there , looking at him with a wide , warm smile was the same girl . 
I'm Lisa , she said , and you're going to be my very own bear . 
I counted what I saved in my piggy+bank . 
do you have a piggy+bank too ? 
and it has lots_of money in it . 
and my mother said I could bring you home . 
no thank you ! 
no thank you , said Lisa . 
and she carried Corduroy home in her arms . 
she ran all the way up four flights of stairs into her family's apartment , and straight into her own room . 
there was a chair . 
and next to a girl sized bed +//. 
what was next to a girl sized bed ? 
this must be home , he said . 
I know I've always wanted a home . 
Lisa sat down with Corduroy on her lap and began to sew a button on his overalls . 
I like you the way you are , she said +... 
but you'll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened . 
you must be a friend , said Corduroy . 
I've always wanted a friend .

Ted jumped into the little bed upstairs . 
and Fred jumped into the big bed downstairs . 
Ted slept all day long in the cosy little bed .
