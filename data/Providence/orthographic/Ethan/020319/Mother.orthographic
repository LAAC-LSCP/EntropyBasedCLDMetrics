0have to push it down a little huh ? 
there ya [: you] go . 
what's Toby doing ? 
chugging along happily . 
sometimes Thomas pulled his coaches Annie and Clarabelle . 
hurry hurry , said the coaches . 
sometimes Thomas pulled freight cars . 
faster faster , said the foolish freight cars . 
they would xxx try to push Thomas down the hill . 
hm: ? 
is the what ? 
sometimes Thomas traveled all by himself across the island . 
he huffed in the sun . 
and he puffed in the snow . 
there is nothing a train cannot do , Thomas said proudly . 
one morning Henry the (.) green engine would not come out of his shed . 
he had +... 
he had +... 
boiler ache , yep [: yes] . 
so Sir Topham Hat asked Thomas to help . 
peep peep , Thomas said to the people . 
I can take you where you want to go . 
soon clouds gathered . 
the sky grew dark . 
plip@o plop@o clunk@o ! 
hail began to fall . 
it fell on Thomas . 
it fell on the tracks . 
suddenly Thomas's driver saw trouble ahead . 
said the driver . 
the hail had made a crack (.) right there in the track . 
Thomas came to a stop . 
his driver called out +... 
we cannot go forward and +... 
we can't go back . 
we must not go back . 
there's the crack . 
everyone off , the conductor said . 
said the people . 
they climbed down from the coaches and climbed up to the road . 
Bertie the bus was just passing by . 
Bertie beeped his horn merrily . 
a bus is as good as a train , he said . 
I can take you where you want to go . 
hm: ? 
Bertie scooted down the road . 
a bus is as good as a train , the people said . 
suddenly Bertie's driver saw trouble ahead . 
why did they have to slow down ? 
hm: ? 
do you remember ? 
why did they have to slow down Ethan ? 
why ? 
why ? 
why ? 
dere [: there] in the road was a bright green toad . 
Bertie came to a stop . 
his driver called out , there's a toa:d in the roa:d , we'll have to unload ! 
everyone off , said Bertie's driver . 
that toad in the road caused a fuss on the bus . 
the people said . 
then they walked down the road to another train station . 
but the trains were not running . 
said the people . 
they soon found out . 
what does that say ? 
Thomas was still stuck at the crack in the track . 
Percy was stuck there at Thomas's (.) back . 
there's Gordon , yep [: yes] . 
mm that's right , James behind Gordon . 
the freight cars were needed in the yard . 
but James could not get past Gordon and Percy and Thomas . 
and the foolish freight cars refused to back up . 
ow . 
will not go , they said . 
they're pretty silly huh ? 
so no train could move up +... 
and no trains could move back . 
they were stuck where they were at that +... 
at that +... 
at that +... 
at this +... 
at that +... 
crack in the track !

I guess there are some things a train cannot do , said Thomas's driver . 
and I know just who to call . 
who are they gonna call ?

(i)t's a little more left huh ?

Thomas's driver called Sir Topham Hat . 
and told him Thomas's plan .

please thank Thomas , he added . 
in no time at all +... 
in no time at all Harold the helicopter zoomed across the sky . 
he landed near the people . 
they all climbed aboard . 
is as good as a train , said Harold . 
I can take you where you want to go . 
the breakdown crew came . 
they had to replace the broken track . 
by the time they arrived rain was falling hard . 
the crew came with cranes . 
they sang while they worked . 
a crane is as good as a bus or a train . 
we'll fix up your track and we +... 
xxx , finally Thomas could move . 
yep [: yes] there's Cranky . 
James with his freight cars was close behind . 
they turned on the turntable and went back to work . 
there is Cranky . 
the people saw Thomas waiting to take them home . 
they asked . 
I thought there was nothing a train could not do , said Thomas . 
but now I know that just isn't true . 
I learned a xxx big lesson from one little crack . 
a train is only as good as its track . 
crack . 
that's right , a crack in the track . 
it's the sun: !

some things are easy to do and some things are hard to do . 
right ?

practice means doing it over and over and over again and trying .
