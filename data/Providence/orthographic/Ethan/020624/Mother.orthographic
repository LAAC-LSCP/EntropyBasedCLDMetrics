Harold and the purple crayon . 
one evening . 
after thinking it over for some time . 
Harold decided to go for a walk in the +... 
moonlight . 
there wasn't any moon . 
and Harold . 
needed a moon oh +... 
needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight . 
a:nd he needed something to walk on . 
he made a lo:ng straight path so he wouldn't get lost . 
and he set off on his walk taking his bi:g purple crayon with him . 
there it is . 
xxx but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the lo:ng straight path . 
so he left the path for a shortcut across a field . 
and the moo:n went with him . 
the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought to be . 
he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very sma:ll forest with +... 
just one tree in it . 
that's right . 
it turned out to be a:n +... 
yep [: yes] . 
the apples would be very tasty Harold thought when they got red . 
so: he put a +... 
yep [: yes] a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples . 
it was a terrible frightening dragon . 
it even frightened Harold he backed away . 
his ha:nd holding the purple crayon +... 
shook ! 
yep [: yes] . 
suddenly he realized +//. 
that's right he's falling right into the water . 
by the:n Harold was over his head +... 
mhm . 
just like you were in the ocean the other day . 
he came up thinking xxx fast . 
xxx thinking fast and thinking big heh . 
he's thinking a lot yep [: yes] . 
he has to +... 
protect himself . 
and in no time at all he was climbing aboa:rd a: +... 
a trim little boat . 
he quickly set sail . 
and the moo:n sai:led alo:ng with him . 
mhm . 
and what did he draw ? 
mhm . 
the sailboat . 
after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without much trouble . 
he stepped ashore on the beach +... 
mhm . 
wondering where he was . 
where was he ? 
right . 
the sandy beach reminded Harold of +... 
yep [: yes] picnics . 
and the thought of picnics made him hungry so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch what was his lunch ? 
yep [: yes] lots_of pies . 
there was nothing but pie . 
but they were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best . 
when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left . 
he hated so to see so much pie go to waste so Harold left +... 
yep [: yes] the moose is gonna eat the pie up and what is the other animal he left ? 
a porcupi:ne a deserving porcupine to finish it up . 
and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was . 
mhm a moose and a porcupine they're gonna finish up all the pie . 
Harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see . 
so he decided to make the hi:ll into a +... 
yep [: yes] mountain . 
if he went high enough he thought he could see the window of his bedroom . 
he was tired and he felt he ought to be getting to bed . 
he hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain . 
but what happened ? 
as he looked down over the other side he +... 
yep [: yes] he slipped . 
and there wasn't any other side of the mountain he was falling in +... 
thin air: but luckily +... 
right he kept his wits and his purple crayon . 
he made a balloon and he grabbed on to it . 
and he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in . 
he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window . 
no I can see your window right over there right over there too ! 
you have two windows in your bedroom . 
we can see the moon out that window . 
at night . 
he couldn't even see a house . 
so he made a house . 
with windows . 
two houses yup [: yes] . 
looks like your house ? 
none of the windows was his window . 
he tried to think where his window ought to be . 
he made some more windows . 
he made a big bui:lding full of windows . 
he made lots_of buildings full of windows . 
he made a whole city full of windows . 
it does look like New York City and there's the moon it's still there . 
but none of the windows was his window . 
he couldn't think where it might be . 
he decided to ask a policeman . 
the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway . 
but Harold thanked him . 
he followed the way . 
and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in bed . 
you gonna walk straight to your bed ? 
then suddenly Harold remembered . 
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon . 
going to your bed ?
