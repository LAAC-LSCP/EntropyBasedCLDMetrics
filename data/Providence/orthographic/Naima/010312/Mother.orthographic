play xxx . 
(o)kay , ooh clunk . 
ooh clunk . 
(o)kay . 
there you are . 
okay . 
it's xxx xxx xxx today is June twenty , June twenty fifth . 
that's making a good noise . 
and I'm gonna test the microphone by clicking the +... 
c_d player controls . 
could hear those very well if this is working . 
Naima . 
xxx . 
do you wanna put on the c_d player ? 
can you put it on ? 
no ? 
okay . 
Mommy will play with you I just wanna get you some crunchy food . 
can you come here for a second ? 
oh that's a bowl . 
shoulda heard that xxx pretty loud if hers is working . 
mm (o)kay . 
yuck . 
mm (o)kay . 
I am testing f@l one . 
you should be able to hear this very clearly . 
that was the (.) c_d player controls . 
I can't play right now because I'm figuring out this equipment . 
you've got a nice cup though . 
bledder@wp bledder@wp is right . 
so I've got it on f@l one . 
but there is no +... 
I do not have the transmitter for f@l two on . 
and I'm close to the camera now so I'm gonna walk outside (.) and if you can hear me then +... 
this transmitter is working . 
cause [: because] I'm gonna be talking constantly (.) and now I'm in the breeze way (.) and now we're looking outside . 
right here . 
well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here . 
so this transmitter itself is not the problem . 
if this sound is working . 
okay (.) now we're gonna go back . 
and replay that . 
okay (.) the only difference with this test is that +... 
on the receiver (.) from the last session you just heard was that on the receiver +... 
if you can hear me now then (.) then what then it makes no difference (.) whether the other transmitter is turned off on the receiver . 
look there's xxx . 
hi xxx . 
hi . 
xxx you gonna open the door for her ? 
good job ! 
xxx . 
okay this is a test of +... 
the transmitter which is on f@l one right now . 
and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem . 
now this should be fine cause [: because] I just tested it . 
xxx this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery +... 
but I did just change the battery , so it has a second new battery , which may have been the problem . 
and if you can hear this it's definitely fine . 
kay [: okay] now I'm coming back to the camera . 
I was in the other room . 
and xxx now I xxx put on the one that's on f@l two . 
and walk into the other room . 
what is +//. 
xxx (.) and jiggling the camera seems to be there +//. 
if I jiggle the camera a little +... 
the green lights are on . 
okay . 
they were kind of jiggling +... 
&-um off and on to red . 
it may be a separate problem . 
and now with this transmitter on f@l two +... 
I'm going to walk away . 
and if you can't hear this +... 
at the same volume right now , then +... 
receiver is not functioning properly . 
right ? 
okay stop . 
okay a double test of the hypothesis that the f@l two channel on the receiver is the malfunction . 
I've just switched transmitters . 
the one I have , I'm putting onto f@l two . 
both green lights on the receiver are on . 
they're on green . 
and I'm walking into the other room , speaking at the same tone of voice . 
and you shouldn't be able , you should be able to +... 
sounds like I'm getting louder and louder now , then the hypothesis is correct .
