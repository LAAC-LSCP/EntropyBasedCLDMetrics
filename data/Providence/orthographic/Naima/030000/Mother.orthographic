the baby wants a diaper . 
Naima is going to be three years old tomorrow . 
we went to all that trouble to find them . 
why did Daddy make that suggestion I wonder . 
I think it's a silly Daddy . 
I don't actually care . 
I'll go get one . 
this is from your suggestion and from your suggestion alone . 
do you know where Daddy was when you were born ? 
he was looking right at you when you came out of my belly . 
he was right there to say hello . 
you know what a welcoming committee is ? 
a welcoming committee is someone or some people who say hello to someone who comes in to a new place . 
and when you came into (.) the world , out of the belly where it was dark , there were people there to say (.) hello: . 
and Daddy was the first one . 
I couldn't see you cause you were down xxx far away from me . 
I'm taking the hair clip out of your hair . 
well , &-um , Grandma xxx took the (.) dirty , I mean the clean laundry away . 
no , it is . 
everybody's [: everybody is] talking about it as if you were supposed to do or be something different like all of a sudden and you don't know how to do or be something different . 
you're gonna still be Naima . 
you would like to be the nursies . 
so either these , or another pair that you pick out from the laundry basket of clean ones . 
cause we're not gonna settle down and read nurse until you get pajamas on . 
put those back in the clean pile please . 
here I am . 
hi . 
there's a bear there who has a bandaid on his snout . 
what are you talking about ? 
and you know what else ? 
and that's okay . 
I'd be happy to do that . 
you get to pick them out , whichever ones you want . 
there's books on the other table , too . 
in fact I see: Timothy's Lost and Found Day over there . 
you want The Big Concrete Lorry ? 
there's Little Farmer Joe +... 
oh_my_goodness , look at those books you picked out . 
what a coincidence , Naima . 
a wand .

he has five friends coming to his party . 
you wanna nurse now ? 
the car might be one of his presents ? 
hm: . 
xxx . 
I see . 
you wanna get another book for me to read ? 
you can save that potty book for Daddy if you want . 
careful , you've [: you have] got something attached to you . 
it's alright . 
I'll just take it off while you're going to get a book . 
whoops , okay .

who tore that , do you think ? 
oh is that why ? 
do you remember (.) using this book when you first started learning how to use a potty ? 
I remember . 
mm , it's funny . 
what happens on this page ? 
you always liked this page . 
o:h , she's making a face , isn't she ? 
you think she thinks that her sister's diapers smell bad ? 
why did you tear off this flap ? 
I don't know why you did . 
is there a pocket flap on that Mommy ? 
today is March thirteenth .

I think that's where the little bunny reads the book .

little bunny sits on the potty and goes .
