xxx . 
okay . 
&u:h , I will help you get that on . 
oh , you're right ! 
I think she doesn't . 
well , you know , xxx might even use a potty most of the time like you do . 
well , she's getting to be a bigger kid like you are . 
he is a little bit older than you . 
xxx is younger than you are , actually . 
xxx , you remember xxx ? 
his mommy had a baby ! 
a little sister for xxx . 
the baby's [: baby is] about only a week old . 
that's all . 
I need to put a little bit (.) on your skin . 
you have a little eczema on your back . 
and I'm gonna get it warmed up and everything . 
it's somewhere down here . 
it's very hard to find . 
and you also have a little bit of dry skin on your shoulders . 
you're gonna +//? 
it's the same Lubriderm that came out of that bottle . 
you mean the whole bottle ? 
oh , okay . 
let me put this on you . 
alright . 
I don't want to spill , that's all . 
mm (o)kay , turn it upside down . 
squeeze it like glue , there . 
you can put some more here . 
you don't wanna put too much on . 
where's what ? 
I don't have eczema , I have dry skin . 
you have eczema , which is (.) not just dry skin but skin that's peeling a little bit . 
alright , a little bit more . 
you know , you could put it on your own body . 
you have a little eczema here . 
does eczema have eggs in it ? 
here , put it on my hand ? 
what ? 
what's the matter ? 
which hand ? 
cause [: because] it's not gonna make it better , right ? 
here , how (a)bout +... 
I'm not gonna rub . 
which which hand , both ? 
you do or you don't ? 
it's not gonna be wet ice , it's just gonna [: going to] be that cold xxx cold pack from the (.) freezer . 
go to sleep ? 
yeah , we're gonna read two books and go to xxx . 
I just wanna show you . 
this is something cold in the freezer . 
ah (.) yeah . 
well , cause [: because] it just came out of the freezer . 
does it feel cold ? 
come here , I wanna look at your hand in the light for a second . 
I'm not gonna xxx +... 
I'm sorry . 
Naima , is it getting better or getting worse ? 
okay , let's [: let us] put on the cold pack . 
xxx . 
of January . 
a child holding its bear . 
oh , just want bare feet ? 
will you let me know if you need to use the potty ? 
now there's room on the table to build a chicken coop . 
see , I moved everything off . 
are we gonna use some blocks for that ? 
okay , it needs to be (.) safe . 
should it be square or round do you think ? 
mm (o)kay . 
well , we'll need to have a doorway , won't we ? 
oh , you're gonna make an open door for it ? 
it's gonna be hard for the animals to get in there , don't you think ? 
well +... 
the chickens need a big door , don't they ? 
mm (o)kay . 
let's [: let us] make the fox hide until we finish making the chicken xxx . 
foxes don't like to just sta:y around people . 
you could put the well over here . 
xxx doesn't matter . 
you can have it wherever you want it . 
what's the horse doing up there ? 
mm , what a nice chicken coop there ! 
mhm . 
to not be with strangers ? 
there's another chick over here . 
mm , they're safe in that coop ? 
right down here , on the floor . 
see , hiding there ? 
it's hiding pretty well if you can't see him (.) or her . 
really ? 
I don't hear anything at all . 
try not to scrape that table . 
it's being very quiet , isn't it ? 
now do you think that fox can get into that chicken coop ? 
you know , a fox who finds a chicken coop +//. 
and I bet that fox would prowl around and go around the chicken coop walking around looking for ways to get in . 
don't you think it can just jump in over those walls ? 
maybe the chicken coop should have (.) a roof . 
xxx , oh dear (.) , oh dear , our chicken coop isn't (.) doesn't have a roof ! 
said Pushpa . 
chickens , chickens , o:h . 
because it wants to run away and make sure the people don't catch it , so it will carry away a chick or an egg . 
hm: , I was thinking (.) we could make +//. 
well , let's [: let us] see . 
a den might be in the root of an old tree or +... 
look underneath some , a pile of wood . 
o:r (.) hm: . 
are you hiding my hair clip in there ? 
I'm looking for my hair clip . 
find toys in there ? 
what should the den be made out of ? 
how (a)bout if we turn the doll cradle that's up there on the table upside down ? 
the one that's up on that table . 
that one up there . 
o:h . 
that might be a good fox den (.) if it's hidden . 
there's the forest (.) with the trees . 
and then a fox den could be under there . 
mm foxes stay in a den (.) during the day and they come out at night . 
xxx they don't want people to see them . 
foxes +//. 
that means they do xxx +//. 
their daytime is our nighttime . 
I wonder if foxes eat fish . 
this is the fish that fell down . 
but the fox might like to go fishing and eat that fish . 
cause [: because] it wasn't in my bra this time . 
it's just out here in the cold air . 
a sponge . 
oh , it was pretend food ? 
so what's the fox gonna do n(ow) +//. 
farmers want their (.) hens and chicks to be safe . 
why ? 
oh . 
oh that looks pretty safe . 
foxes sometimes can take down fences and things , but not whole walls . 
I think I see one over here . 
where is the fox ? 
in the den ? 
you mean it's daytime ? 
it's sleeping during the day in its den , I think . 
and then at night it will come out . 
and look for chicks and chickens . 
so what do the farmers need to do during the day ? 
o:kay . 
well that's a good place for them at night , but during the day , when there's , when there's sunlight and farmers are around and the dogs and cats and everyone's [: everyone is] around , it's safe to have the chickens come out and peck in the ground and run around . 
okay . 
just gonna watch ? 
Tush ? 
Tush , okay . 
o:h , xxx , mm . 
xxx , that's the sound it makes when it drinks water ? 
a chick is loose . 
meow , meow . 
meow , meow . 
you want more ? 
I'm not going to bring any more food for you (.) cat . 
xxx , what's she doing ? 
okay . 
here's your dish of food , pigs . 
let me see what else I have . 
xxx , the food is too mushy ? 
I think pigs like food even if it's mushy . 
pigs will eat almost anything . 
you doing some puzzles ? 
xxx do it by yourself . 
(o)kay . 
I wanna figure out +... 
ah ha ha ha . 
&-uh not xxx , xxx . 
he lives in Brewster . 
he lives there with his mommy and daddy and his little brother . 
xxx brother who must be (.) one and a half now . 
I remember when his little brother was born +... 
those are the di:nosaurs . 
do you remember ? 
bray +... 
brachiosaurus . 
Pteranodon . 
yea:h [: yes] , stegosaurus . 
do you remember ? 
Styracosaurus . 
do you remember what this one is +//? 
Styracho(saurus) +//. 
also called Tyrannosaurus_Rex . 
Tyrannosaurus_Rex . 
where ? 
Spinosaurus . 
do you remember what kind that is ? 
tri: [: triceratops] +... 
right . 
&u:h , oh yes . 
Para +... 
Parasaurolophus . 
do you remember ? 
bray +... 
now it's all done ! 
there's the one about the farm that xxx gave you as a Christmas present in the box . 
that's a new one . 
okay . 
should we dump all the pieces out ? 
mhm . 
look at the picture , it might help us realize +//. 
to make it harder ? 
xxx . 
here's a corner . 
why don't we start out with +//. 
cause [: because] this is how it goes , and that I think is that corner . 
and this is the top edge of the puzzle , and this is the bottom edge of the puzzle . 
well , where do you think sky might go ? 
which edge do you think the sky might go (.) at ? 
this is the top edge . 
I would guess sky would go at the top edge of the puzzle . 
should we find all the sky pieces ? 
this part is straight . 
so put the straight part against the straight part of the puzzle base . 
okay , let's [: let us] see where that one goes . 
does it go there ? 
he:y , it does ! 
that looks like a sky: corner piece . 
I don't know . 
xxx . 
somewhere up here , I think along the top edge . 
does it fit ? 
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . 
that means there will be eight pieces along the bottom edge also . 
cause [: because] they will have the same number of pieces . 
this also looks like sky . 
is it +//? 
hm: . 
let's [: let us] see , those two pieces have some sky . 
did Daddy teach you that word ? 
is that something you say when you do puzzles ? 
it almost goes , but it needs to have a straight (.) edge . 
wanna try that one ? 
mm . 
well that wouldn't need to have a straight +//. 
and there's no more sky . 
we should get some more edge pieces . 
mm , that's a good guess . 
let's [: let us] see , straight edges but with water . 
this piece has a straight edge and some water . 
wanna check that one out ? 
one straight edge +//. 
do you wanna check and see if that goes there ? 
xxx . 
and then the next piece would have one straight edge and some tree trunk . 
and maybe part of the neck , tree trunk and neck . 
are there any pieces with straight edges that have some tree trunk and some neck ? 
I'm finding all the pieces with straight edges . 
this is +... 
straight edge and it has tree trunk . 
does that go I wonder ? 
match up the straight edge of the piece with the straight edge of the puzzle . 
that means turn it around so that the straight edge is there . 
oh you're right . 
mm there must be corner pieces somewhere . 
so we need a corner piece that has some tree+trunk . 
I'm looking for another corner piece . 
oh , here's a corner piece . 
no:w , I have a question for you . 
when it's all done , how many corner pieces would there be ? 
right , when it's all done there should be four corner pieces cause [: because] there are four corners in this rectangular puzzle . 
we only need one more (.) corner piece . 
so I see one and I think I'm gonna put it here cause [: because] I think it's gonna go there . 
hm: . 
which part of the puzzle should we try next ? 
he:y ! 
mhm , the next piece here needs to have +//. 
hm: . 
hm: , it needs to be a right edge piece cause [: because] this is a +//. 
maybe that goes down there . 
that piece , does it go there ? 
he:y . 
okay , we nee:d to find that piece . 
well , we've done quite a bit , haven't we ? 
here's what I think might be +//. 
this might be a right edge piece . 
I think this is part of an animal . 
here is (.) an edge piece that has the same color as that . 
o:h , yeah you're right . 
mm look for a tiny piece of snout . 
oh , is that a tiny piece of snout ? 
hm: , I think this one . 
that dinosaur looks like it's biting another dinosaur's tail . 
is it ? 
no: , maybe not . 
no . 
I don't know , maybe like there . 
I think this brown dinosaur might be a really big one . 
how (a)bout that ? 
that doesn't go there . 
mm , sometimes you just hafta try things out . 
hm: . 
hm: . 
hm: , this is some sky in here . 
sky . 
hm: . 
we need this dino's [: dinosaur's] head , don't we ? 
I'm looking for a head (.) piece . 
mm . 
a little bit of a mouth . 
xxx I wonder whose snout that is . 
now we have the rest of that dino's [: dinosaur's] body . 
we found our mittens we have lost ? 
I don't think that goes there , though . 
are you sitting on any pieces , by the way ? 
I see one under you there . 
I don't think it goes there . 
you're right , it's the same color , but (.) you need like the little tiny back of that +... 
yep [: yes] , I think that's right . 
hey he:y . 
I don't know . 
you need a piece with sky to go there . 
I'm gonna try this one . 
no , it doesn't go . 
I noticed that one was . 
well because the kind of wood that these are made out of , it's called like &-um pressed wood . 
it's called , it's called like laminate pressed wood . 
and so (.) moisture can get inside the wood and change the shape of the piece a tiny tiny tiny bit . 
does that go there ? 
you find some red to match this (.) dinosaur's coloring there ? 
that looks like it could be a Spinosaurus , doesn't it ? 
like the one that's in the other puzzle ? 
actually , you know what , I think the back has a guide +... 
I'm just gonna see if that's a Spinosaurus , number six . 
and there's a brachiosaurus . 
right at the top . 
I think this is the brachiosaurus . 
mm , turn it around a little . 
try turning it all the way around . 
does it go there ? 
I see a bit of a grey dinosaur's neck there . 
it's not very humid now , but it was humid this summer , so +... 
okay . 
I see something that might go there . 
hm: , looks like an edge , like a bottom edge piece , doesn't it ? 
yeah try that , the bot(tom) , the straight edge +... 
there . 
goo:d . 
let's [: let us] see . 
ya [: you] have any more sky pieces ? 
mm (o)kay . 
and one more piece with sky . 
no your right knee , yeah . 
I think that might go there . 
o:h , but (.) the blue sky should be at the top . 
yeah . 
he:y ! 
we finished the sky . 
hm: , maybe turn it around a little . 
maybe there's water that's here and there's water that's here . 
oh , that looks right , Naima . 
he:y . 
is this the right color ? 
well , there's a little bit of green there . 
ahhah ! 
this , I see like this dinosaur needs a piece (.) , and there's a leg . 
there . 
very nice . 
well , try the next spot over here . 
and here's the last edge piece . 
it's affected by the humidity . 
now we only have two more pieces to match . 
it has water . 
try down there , cause [: because] I see a little green there . 
is that upside down maybe ? 
there . 
do you wanna do this one (.) that xxx gave you ? 
it's a different kind of puzzle . 
well it is . 
(o)kay . 
I: think so . 
well I'll do part of it , and then I'm gonna go take a shower . 
well , you can tell if it's an edge piece cause [: because] it has a straight edge , and to be able to see the horse's face right side up +... 
I think it's the top . 
why don't we do all the edges first , and then fill in ? 
I think that's also a top edge . 
and that's a right edge . 
this is a: corner . 
I'd love to . 
can I go now ? 
oh thank you . 
look at that piece over to your left with the horse . 
this is a corner piece . 
you can come get me if you need me . 
what ? 
I've got to get dressed now and come and help you some more . 
have you got some pieces more +//. 
xxx . 
you did not put the cow in ? 
okay . 
so there's more for me to help with ? 
by the way , do you need to use the potty ? 
it's a what voice ? 
xxx . 
xxx xxx xxx thank you . 
o:kay . 
are you a sleepy child ? 
I know there's a lump over there .
