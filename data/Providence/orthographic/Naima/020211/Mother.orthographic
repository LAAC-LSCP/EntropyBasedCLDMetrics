an' [: and] we can make a salad too . 
save some for your dad , if possible .

you're cooling it down yourself ? 
yes , yes , I've seen her do that before . 
one is pink and there's a red one , coming in . 
it might be , busy , though , although if we went , &-er &-um +...

yeah but you know , your parents , it's not so , great to have it around because of them . 
but this I dunno [: don't know] you know , I didn't check the hours of the new place up here . 
I think , that their other ones aren't ripe , but you could have some strawberry , the other ones are , hard . 
can I get you some fresh strawberry ? 
he's double checking . 
look , don't these look good ? 
okay . 
I'm gonna cut it .

that's right . 
well Naima had strawberries at Gene's farm .

I don't think the deer actually come into the strawberry patch to poop . 
to make it easier to eat , okay ? 
close your eyes for a minute and then I'll they'll feel better , if you , close them for a little +//. 
not not hard , just lightly . 
you don't hafta , shut them that tightly , look how Mommy's closing her eyes .

that's making a mess . 
Naima hold still , there's a strawberry down here . 
somewhere .

spells baby Bjorn . 
I would actually like to get , more of these bowls . 
and the spoons that go with em [: them] are just right too . 
they're not deep . 
they're the same , about the same as this +... 
there was a bird at the feeder ? 
how did he know that the seeds were there ? 
because we put them there , maybe he saw us putting them there ? 
that would be one way he would know . 
not the weeds . 
we want the seeds to grow not the weeds . 
flowers ? 
the weeds were flowering ? 
we have lots more things to plant in our garden . 
beans , and I ordered some more seeds from a , kind of a rare seed place . 
a french pumpkin . 
&-um , some flowers . 
what did I order ? 
oh yes , bachelor's buttons ! 
you hafta find a special place for them with Daddy . 
you gonna make a row for them , just like we made rows in the garden . 
you could do that . 
I would spare space if you wanted to , have them in the , vegetable garden . 
or at least partial sun . 
but , you could just clear out , some of whatever's there and put them . 
see how tall they are . 
maybe Tuesday when it's , if maybe if it's not raining . 
yeah . 
some , some don't . 
okay , does not transplant well . 
two to three foot tall , that's really tall for bachelor's buttons . 
huh , it'd be interesting . 
I have up to here . 
well , then , it's a variety for you . 
that'll be nice , I think that would be a good place . 
mm . 
would you like some toast to eat Naima ? 
I'll toast the toast , for you . 
well the toaster's [: toaster is] unplugged , that's okay . 
yeah , I just +//. 
why am I fanning ? 
mhm . 
the plastic smell ? 
dya [: do you] want some fresh banana ? 
yeah it's not good to really do gardening when the ground is wet , (be)cause you spread things all over the place . 
we do need to tug up more weeds well maybe , who knows , maybe today it won't rain very much , and maybe it will get a little dryer and maybe we can do , things outside . 
and you slid down the pole and , actually do you remember , when we went with Grandma xxx to the Museum of Science , there was a play+ground that had a pole , and you slid down that pole too ! 
we helped you slide down that pole . 
miss , little firefighter girl . 
dya [: do you] remember that play+ground ? 
it had wiggly +... 
what did it have ? 
I dunno [: don't know] if it had a turtle , did it ? 
I think there were three , two or three wiggly things . 
wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly . 
wiggly wiggly wiggly you were going back and forth from one to the other . 
wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly . 
they had , things to climb on .

yes ! 
I remember that almost more than , being sick . 
why is that flashing ? 
oh the tape's almost over , how could that be ? 
oh ! 
I didn't know that . 
I should read the manual , I suppose . 
well , we could have a whole hour on it I spose [: suppose] . 
dya [: do you] want jam on it ? 
think that's in the door . 
I'll take this , xxx . 
I guess I don't feel like cooking (be)cause the , amount of dishes that ends up getting generated is just +... 
it's like three meals a day for , four people is , like constant cooking and cleaning up . 
she's putting her own spoon in that jar so we hafta +... 
put the knife in , and scoop it out . 
that's not how we eat jam , we eat jam on toast .
