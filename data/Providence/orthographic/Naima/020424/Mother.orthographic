that's just what it's called . 
look , the milk is floating . 
there's the dinosaur's tail . 
cause [: because] the pan of peas is floating in the flood .

but he kept talking and he didn't realize he sliced the toaster in half also . 
oh no . 
xxx .

cause [: because] he was looking at someone else and talking to someone else . 
if you have a knife in your hand you can't do that . 
you hafta look at the knife and be very careful with what you're doing . 
don't gulp hot foods . 
taste them slowly . 
you know about that . 
that dinosaur's mouth is hurting because (.) he ate something that was too hot .
