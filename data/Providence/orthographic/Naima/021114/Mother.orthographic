just a minute , Naima . 
the (.) &-um barn into the veterinary hospital ? 
can we take some of the animals out to make special stalls for the sick animals ? 
what do you think ? 
I know . 
that's what he's doing right now . 
why don't you take the animals out and we'll have a veterinary hospital in the barn ? 
okay . 
you mean like a (.) i_v fluid is what you mean . 
o:h , great idea . 
oh is that (.) &-um (.) bees wax ? 
I'm making more room on the floor and taking down the trains . 
yeah . 
it might be hard to get that out actually . 
do you want that to come out ? 
do you want me to help you ? 
I might need a special tool to take out that wax . 
no , something very narrow . 
like a pen even , or +... 
something very small . 
oh , you took it out ! 
oh no , there's still a little bit in there . 
there . 
should I take that ? 
okay . 
great . 
&u:h , so +... 
mm is that for checking how well the animals' hearts are working ? 
okay . 
Pushpa is the doctor or the nurse ? 
okay . 
that's a good question . 
that tree is a painted tree . 
it's a certain kind of a tree that grows near the water . 
and what ? 
it could be growing near the pond at the farm . 
mm , to hold the base of the tree . 
well , there's two pieces of wood making up that tree . 
I think it's supposed to be the grass under the tree . 
I think that's what that's supposed to be . 
okay . 
okay , here's the doctor . 
okay . 
let's [: let us] see . 
who's going to bring the sick animal ? 
who's the sick animal now ? 
all of them ? 
okay . 
well , in the morning the doctors probably hafta do their rounds . 
oh , so what happens at nighttime at the veterinary hospital ? 
curl up ? 
her mother is a doctor ? 
I'll be right back . 
I'm gonna look something up , Naima . 
so , only about five minutes has elapsed since I stopped recording . 
when I played it back I heard a little interference that then went away , so I'm hoping it's not major interference . 
okay . 
yeah . 
do you want to keep playing &-uh veterinary hospital now ? 
alright . 
alright o:h , is this a sick mouse ? 
okay . 
okay . 
you mean which door is for which stall ? 
oh it's hard when they're open to figure it out , isn't it ? 
these are the stalls that are veterinary hospital . 
is this the xxx veterinary hospital ? 
okay . 
okay , does the mouse need some medicine ? 
and who else is an animal who's [: who is] gonna be brought to the veterinary hospital ? 
this little cow hit its ear on a speaker at the concert ? 
o:h . 
well maybe this little calf needs its ear examined . 
and the mother is coming along with it to keep it company . 
okay . 
well , should I come back to check on my cows in the morning ? 
goodby:e . 
goodbye . 
there's a stall for you I think , where you can be while you're getting better here at the veterinary hospital . 
a colt ? 
it hit its nose on Pushpa ? 
does it need a nose bandage ? 
oh , dear . 
that's quite +//. 
oh , and my horse and my colt are here at the veterinary hospital , too . 
treated well by the veterinarians . 
okay , I've [: I have] got to go back and feed my other animals here . 
the veterinary hospital could have a barn cat , who lives here , who isn't sick who just lives here all the time . 
the pig's eating something . 
mm . 
what's wrong with the cat ? 
huh . 
did it get a tummy+ache from that ? 
I see . 
Pushpa , what are you going to do ? 
Pushpa is the veterinarian , isn't she ? 
you can't do it ? 
what's she gonna do to examine it ? 
shall we get some medicine made out of bees wax up here ? 
here's some cat medicine . 
when cats get upset tummies , they can have that kind of medicine . 
cause that's the +//. 
it's only soft if it gets warmed up by something , like someone's body , or +... 
and xxx came that time . 
xxx . 
you mean when it falls out of my clothes ? 
very soon , though . 
what else happens at a veterinary hospital ? 
but when they're sick they can't eat ? 
are they gonna get some special water ? 
hm: . 
o:h , do we need a little container of milk on it ? 
&-um maybe we could get some white bees wax . 
do we have a tiny little bowl somewhere , Naima ? 
a tiny , tiny bowl ? 
yeah , it's not really warm enough right now . 
ah , this'll [: this will] make some good milk . 
this is warm now , if you wanna make some medicine out of that . 
I'll make some milk out of this one . 
here , I'm gonna warm this white part up and make some milk out of it . 
can you find a little dish for the cat to eat from ? 
mm well we need to use that . 
no this is white milk . 
there you go . 
mm now the cat can have some milk . 
oops ! 
the cat fell upside down in the big milk bowl . 
that's gonna be a wet cat ! 
don't ya [: you] think ? 
(o)kay , that seemed to be recording very nicely . 
let's [: let us] see , what's gonna happen next ? 
doctor Lisa , doctor Lisa . 
oh , no ! 
someone's bringing them to the +//. 
o:h , okay . 
we're gonna help you feel better here at the hospital . 
first of all , just lie down for a little bit . 
oh yes , I feel the lantern in there . 
but those are very tiny lanterns , aren't they ? 
are you their mother ? 
how big was the lantern ? 
I think they'll probably poop it out . 
who was there when they swallowed the lanterns , their mothers or their father ? 
a babysitter was there ? 
and then did the babysitter tell the bears' father what had happened ? 
oh , and they couldn't take them out quickly , huh ? 
sounds like they did it on purpose . 
o:h . 
o:h . 
that poor , poor bear . 
oh , that one needs medicine ? 
yeah but the mother has it , and the mother can help it have the medicine . 
o:h . 
the doctor has so many patients to see . 
I see . 
mhm . 
the mother has to help the bear have the medicine . 
okay . 
this medicine actually tastes like blueberries , did you know that ? 
here it is , right here . 
and then your mommy can give you hugs and kisses to also help you feel better . 
okay , I'm gonna give you a prescription to take home to get medicine for you bear . 
and he'll be better very soon . 
xxx . 
your underwear was mixed up with my underwear . 
now , that goes in your drawer . 
in fact , Naima , it's time to get dressed . 
no , Sleepy , it's a different gym . 
I sure am . 
how does he know what song is gonna be there at the gym class ? 
they do play loud music there . 
but this one , I don't know if there's music or not . 
o:h , don't play with that , it's not a toy . 
okay , what I'd like you to do is take off your big kid pants and +... 
and your pajamas . 
oh , really ? 
today is Saturday , February twenty eighth . 
hm: , the calf and the cow ? 
mhm . 
well , dogs eat dog+food , but we can find out more about dog food . 
we'll find out about +... 
o:h . 
I wonder if I could make a pail out of +//. 
calves don't have udders . 
the animals are xxx . 
hm: . 
no . 
let's [: let us] see . 
xxx soft xxx . 
xxx against my body . 
we hafta wait til xxx soften up . 
&-um , some farm animals like to eat things like corn cobs , from corn+on+the+cob , leftover cobs . 
&-uh , I don't know if cows like that in particular , but (.) I think some other animals do . 
bye . 
one of the animals can eat the corn cob . 
you know , we could look up which animals eat corn cobs . 
I'm not sure if horses are allowed to eat corn cobs or not . 
why , you're right , it's not very soft , cause I didn't put this one in my bra . 
I'm trying to make these without doing that . 
I was gonna make a milking pail with the black bees wax . 
is it ? 
that one wasn't . 
here , you can roll it just the way you roll Play_Doh . 
did you know that ? 
mhm . 
xxx , if you hold them in your hand even for a little while , it will get , actually +... 
I've actually started putting things in here , in my (.) in the waist of my pants . 
I think that's pretty hard . 
maybe cause it's been in your hand for a little while . 
whose job is it to feed the animals (.) at your farm ? 
it's his job ? 
why don't you put the baby in the cradle ? 
put it there , or in your bed maybe . 
an unmouthed baby ? 
cause it doesn't have a mouth ? 
xxx , I think that's just so that you can imagine the mouth that it has . 
sometimes it takes a while for these things to warm up . 
I was just handling that one . 
I was gonna make the pail now . 
and it got warm ? 
no I wasn't , but that's a very thin piece , so it probably wouldn't take much to warm it . 
hold it with your palm and see if it gets softer . 
yeah , I think so . 
mhm . 
I'm making the milking pail so that the farmer can milk the cow . 
oh , from the cow , nice fresh milk ? 
it's a pail to +//. 
yes , I just made that pail that you are smashing with your fingers (.) with great glee . 
are you smashing it with glee ? 
yeah , this bees wax really does smell nice xxx . 
I'm gonna go down to the basement and photocopy something . 
xxx Daddy's office . 
hm: ? 
a milk what ? 
okay . 
it's not a pail anymore , I might as well make a dish out of it . 
yes I was . 
a lucky cat . 
not all cats are given milk . 
not all cats like milk , but those that do are lucky they have it . 
here's a milk dish . 
Lubriderm for the cow ? 
does the cow have a sore back , or chapped chapped skin on his back ? 
you can put the milk in here . 
yeah , let's [: let us] imagine that . 
what do you imagine that cat might be thinking ? 
yeah . 
I'll make a purple dish for the other cat . 
well , I guess I'm +//. 
except that's really too hard . 
(o)kay . 
I'm making another dish for the other cat . 
mm [x 6] . 
&-uh , that's okay , I'll fix it . 
you could just leave that there for now , okay ? 
yeah , I don't want it to drag . 
I'm attaching this to you . 
let's [: let us] make a +... 
sometimes farmers will let the animals go down to the pond to drink water . 
who's [: who is] thirsty: ? 
the calf . 
xxx . 
xxx . 
what about the horses ? 
mm . 
hm: ? 
I think the pigs are hungry . 
you know what people say when they want the pigs to come and they can feed them ? 
sometimes people say +... 
well when you're calling pigs , you call them in a special way too . 
that tells the pigs to come and get their lunch . 
or their breakfast or their snack . 
sooey ! 
where are those pigs ? 
Pushpa is saying sooey . 
sooey ! 
they're having some nice corn cobs . 
&-uh , that's a good question . 
I don't know if there's one way to call roosters . 
hm: . 
I don't know . 
I only know about pigs and cats , I think . 
good question though . 
yeah , is it soft now ? 
I don't think it was warmed up . 
and that warmed it up ? 
xxx . 
there's the hens and the rooster . 
we have two roosters , don't we ? 
xxx . 
mm . 
well the ones that had price stickers were bought at the (.) store , xxx store . 
and then some of them were bought , the other animals were bought by Grandma xxx as a present for you . 
yes . 
she bought you quite a few of these animals for Christmas . 
yep [: yes] , the pigs . 
and then at Christmas Grandma xxx gave you two hens , one rooster (.) two or three chicks . 
and then she gave you the (.) &-um +//. 
the Guernsey calf and the Guernsey cow , and the other cat , and the horse and the colt +... 
and then after that , I got you +//. 
why ? 
mm . 
yes , when I and Daddy got you the barn , we got you Pushpa also . 
well I bought it , but it's a present from Mommy and Daddy , even though I was the one who actually got it at the store . 
it's a present from Mommy and Daddy . 
for you . 
it wasn't even Christmas , it wasn't even your birthday , it was just cause we thought you'd [: you would] have fun with it . 
you think so ? 
xxx . 
are you sitting in the pond ? 
oh , this is really soft now . 
do you want it ? 
should I make a puddle ? 
the pigs are in a big mud puddle . 
those pigs like to be in mud . 
what is Veena gonna help you do ? 
there's another mud puddle , oh boy . 
pigs like mud . 
oh , you're another pig . 
oh . 
ooh . 
it probably wouldn't really hurt him , actually . 
it probably would +//. 
hm: , look at this . 
I'm making something like a window . 
mhm . 
duck food ? 
are you whistling to that song Run Children Run with Daddy ? 
a little ducky . 
for the farm . 
mhm . 
this is its head that my fingers are on right now . 
xxx . 
yes , they could say +//. 
would you like to go: to the play+ground ? 
why would the duck be scared ? 
oh , the animals are making their noises and that makes the duck scared ? 
the duck could just quack quack right back at them . 
xxx . 
ducks can be very loud and noisy too , you know . 
the pig's scared of the duck ? 
xxx . 
because they're also birds ? 
oh , the cat too , huh ? 
hm: . 
this hen's [: hen is] gonna eat the leftover corn cobs that the pigs didn't finish . 
yeah , she's supposed to be in a position to pick grain and eat it . 
mhm . 
is the farmer gonna help them find it ? 
I don't know , were you ? 
xxx . 
I wonder if the ducks eat flowers sometimes . 
xxx . 
cause it's a pig . 
I think cause it probably makes them cool off a little bit . 
yeah , I don't think they like hot . 
even people don't like to be too hot . 
is it a muddy pig ? 
is the farmer washing off the pig ? 
(o)kay . 
you're doing a good job making it say that . 
well , that's what you just said , though . 
I wanna eat the corn+on+the+cob ! 
don't smash it up ! 
what are you making ? 
I would like to eat that corn+on+the+cob . 
oh , are we gonna read books now ? 
we need to clean up a little bit if we're gonna read that . 
oh , there's a chick in here . 
where did you put .
