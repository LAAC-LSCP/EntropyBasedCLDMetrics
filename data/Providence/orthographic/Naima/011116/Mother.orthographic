well , it's partly +//. 
yeah , sure . 
no I (.) well +... 
well I mean I am willing to do what it takes to reduce it , but not to (.) force it , if you know what I mean . 
it is (.) well , I can go on and on on this topic , it's like all I ever think about , to be honest with you xxx ! 
I mean no , that's an exaggeration , but +... 
(be)cause sleep is important , that's why . 
for all of us . 
I mean , she barely wakes up to nurse . 
so it's not a question about her not sleeping , it's a question about me not sleeping . 
no , &-um , what we did +... 
is (.) a couple of months , well maybe like three or four months ago we got a single bed and put it next to our king sized bed in our bedroom . 
so she sleeps on that much of the night . 
so she's farther away from me . 
and , and I try to just wait and see if she's really waking up to nurse or not . 
(be)cause sometimes she'll almost wake up but then she'll go back to sleep without being nursed . 
so , it's also about listening carefully and waiting . 
but anyway sometimes I'll go down to her (.) bed to nurse her and sometimes I'll bring her up to the bed , and sometimes I'll have the energy to put her back on hers and other times she just stays in bed . 
I mean I'm not , I , I don't feel , feel like I have an ideal situation . 
xxx . 
can I , can I tell you about a book that I like though about this topic , &-um +... 
Elizabeth Pantley is the author . 
it's called the no cry sleep solution . 
and she is someone who has worked with , &-um (.) William Sears , who writes all those children's books . 
&-um , and I , I like her approach (be)cause she's kind of like , she's kind of like , &-um +... 
like if you need to sleep , she's got suggestions on what you can do , and yet she +... 
recognizes there are lots_of people like me , at least , who want , like no crying xxx . 
but want to sleep . 
like , possible ways of making that happen . 
stuff like that , so , it's not like you hafta follow a plan . 
yeah , oh I think she's got some really good ideas , and +... 
and I was also on an , an email group of people who are following her plan , and there's like eight hundred people on the list . 
so I don't follow it , I mean I kinda [: kind of] like , I just kind of abandoned it for the time being but , but I , but I think a lot of people are actually having success with her method . 
and a lot of people aren't too , I mean I'd say that , it's like one of those things . 
so +... 
Furbur , yes . 
yeah . 
right . 
think through what you might wanna do . 
mhm . 
mhm . 
yeah . 
yeah . 
yeah . 
and that's hard for him ?
