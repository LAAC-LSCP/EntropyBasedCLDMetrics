&-um , today is Friday the twenty fifth . 
and you can see yourself when it's done , you can't see yourself now . 
&-um , so . 
we're about +//. 
and have switched +... 
batteries in the receiver and one of the transmitters . 
I see more bear food here . 
would you like yogurt to have with those almonds ? 
how bout [: about] so:me Oatios ? 
how bout [: about] so:me Kamut cake ? 
how bout [: about] some cheese ? 
I think bears do like cheese , especially bear +/. 
I think bears do like cheese , especially bear cubs . 
where's the cheese , here it is . 
oh , what a rawring@o bear . 
that's quite a rawr@o , Naima . 
doesn't like the bear food ? 
why doesn't the bear like the bear food ? 
what , that's cheese , you like cheese .

dyou [: did you] say the bear's tummy would like a smaller piece ? 
xxx .

xxx . 
very funny . 
very funny . 
it's a cheese square . 
what ? 
that's the shape of a curve , oh that piece of cheese ? 
let's see . 
yeah it does have a curve you're right . 
it doesn't rock , well blocks that are curved can rock , cheese that is curved (.) probably won't rock as well . 
he:re's the crackers . 
you rearranging your cheese ?

xxx . 
hm: . 
are you making a little sandwich ? 
xxx , is it a sunny day today ? 
what kind of a day is it ? 
hm: , it's a Mommy day ? 
are you sure it's not a Naima day ? 
it's a lovely Naima day today . 
mhm I bet xxx would love to take you to the play+ground today . 
well , maybe . 
well , you need to make sure you have lunch before you have ice+cream . 
besides , are you gonna go shopping with xxx and buy the eggs ? 
but I need you to buy eggs . 
why not ? 
that would be very helpful for Mommy . 
don't you like helping Mommy ? 
no , usually you do like helping . 
you joking ? 
I thought so . 
rawr@o . 
you could be the only bear in the store , if you go to the store . 
you could bring Grizzly to the store and put him next to you in the wagon . 
and Griz could ride in the car , too . 
and Griz could wear the booties . 
and you could even carry him in the backpack in the store if you want . 
go with xxx and buy the eggs and show Griz where the eggs are in the store . 
I bet he doesn't know , cause [: because] he's a little bear . 
yup [: yes] , you know and you could show him . 
you could show him what things a store has . 
I don't think Griz has , I think maybe Sleepy Bear's been to the store with you but I don't think Griz has been to the store . 
Sleepy's [: Sleepy is] a big bear . 
oh , he can buy things ? 
who are we talking about now ? 
mhm . 
why do I think you should have lunch before ice+cream ? 
cause [: because] ice+cream is a treat . 
it's a little bit special . 
and (.) you need to make sure you have things with protein before you eat ice+cream . 
it's just a rule . 
it is a rule . 
don't spill that please . 
well , please don't take it out , that's gonna make a +//. 
Naima .
