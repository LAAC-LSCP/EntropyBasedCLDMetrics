I like that idea . 
well then it won't make a mess . 
okay . 
let's get you clean and get you out . 
is that right ? 
and sometimes they come maybe because they smell food and the door's left open just a crack . 
people sometimes leave doors open by accident , and then cats can get out +... 
you think it was brocco [: broccoli] hummus ? 
you did have some spinach with potato though . 
yeah it was dried onto your nose , that's right . 
I think , I also think that's what it was .

you see the fly again ? 
that's alright . 
what were you spelling with a b@l ? 
actually b@l is the first letter in brocco [: broccoli] hummus . 
that's just the sound that letter b@l makes . 
I'm not seeing the fly . 
you worried about the fly ? 
most of the flies that come in the house anyway , they're not the kind that bite . 
you can use this one .

let's read Snow_Day , and then +... 
cause [: because] you , you need a pajama top . 
after you get your pajama top on +... 
Mommy will brush Mommy's teeth . 
Daddy did a good job didn't he . 
you started to do the zipper ? 
oh , I guess I didn't know that , you can show me afterwards . 
there's a snow+storm happening . 
take your hand off the microphone though . 
cause [: because] there's snow coming out of the sky , out of the clouds . 
mm , weather watchers had been predicting a big snow+storm for days . 
&-uh , what kind of a truck is that ? 
it's doing what to the snow ? 
it's (.) pushing the snow . 
mm , so that the cars can drive , you're right . 
cars can't drive through this kind of snow . 
so the plow is (.) taking the snow out of the streets . 
even before the snow stopped falling town work crews were out with their trucks to begin a long hard job of digging out . 
mm . 
look at all the houses , and buildings , and schools , and there's a church +... 
they're all covered with snow . 
building , from one building to another . 
or maybe those are telephone wires actually . 
hm: , those might be electric and telephone wires . 
the wire that you saw at Craigville beach with Daddy and the ducks that you saw on the way ? 
you saw a wire in the sand , huh ? 
I think that's what you told me (.) that (.) he said it was . 
remember we saw a lifeguard today at Douse's beach ? 
she was wearing red (.) pants . 
and a red swim+suit . 
xxx she was a lifeguard . 
lifeguards sometimes wear red . 
yes , they do they like to go in the water with swimsuits . 
well , lifeguards are there in case anybody has trouble in the water and they need help . 
lifeguards are there to go and , and give them help if they need help in the water . 
&-uh difficulty in the water , swimming . 
and you need some help , you need someone to help carry you . 
but you're not gonna have that problem cause [: because] you'll learn how to swim . 
there's the plow again , I see it . 
I also see a whole lot of school buses covered with snow . 
dyou [: do you] see them ? 
right there . 
all the school buses are covered with snow and they're not (.) taking the children to school . 
because there's too much snow ! 
that's a family who is waking up and looking out at the snow . 
and finding out (.) that (.) it's a snow day ! 
oh boy , everybody's having fun here , what's everybody doing ? 
you tell me , what do you see ? 
that kid . 
they're having a snowball fight . 
that means you make balls out of the snow and you throw them . 
that's a game , it's kind of a game that kids play . 
cause [: because] it's fun to make the snowballs and then , they throw them at each other and they go phwack@o . 
phwack@o . 
oh , the dinosaur , the dinosaur's tail sounds like thwack , you remember that . 
oh , did that hurt ? 
&aw . 
I see some kids building (.) a snow+man . 
the kid in the red jacket is making a snow+man . 
that maybe they are building a , an igloo . 
out of snow . 
or a snow fort . 
I think that's she's carrying some snow to build a wall there . 
it's just a fun thing to do that's all . 
and I see a lot of kids who are sliding on sleds down the hill . 
in this picture . 
that sled is being pulled by a mommy . 
I think you're remembering when it was winter and Mommy pulled you and the sled up the driveway and you saw Tahoe . 
was she barking ? 
she was a young dog then . 
dyou [: do you] know that bird sound right now ? 
those are morning doves . 
listen again . 
they'll probably make another noise in just a minute . 
there ! 
that hoo@o oo@o hoo@o hoo@o . 
yeah . 
let's listen . 
hey Mommy xxx . 
let's listen for the morning dove again . 
xxx make a noise in just a second . 
I guess the morning dove (.) decided not to talk . 
xxx she's being quiet . 
Daddy's [: Daddy is] downstairs making some phone calls . 
okay . 
lemme [: let me] take off my microphone . 
turn off the microphones . 
I guess the morning dove went to sleep . 
xxx cause [: because] it's nighttime and it's bedtime . 
let's get up , cause [: because] I'm gonna +... 
gonna turn off the tape recorder , and &-uh , you wanna [: want to] go see if you really wanna see Daddy ? 
you know Daddy's gonna come upstairs as soon as he's done making his phone calls . 
the morning doves are sleeping .
