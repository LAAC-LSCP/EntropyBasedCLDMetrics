it's December twenty fourth . 
you're not actually . 
at this moment . 
look at these really nice outdoor gloves . 
and +... 
another umbrella . 
do you remember what this is ? 
it says Diwali two thousand and three on it . 
show it to Daddy . 
we made it at &-uh (.) color me mime . 
candle holder fer [: for] +... 
and this is the present for +... 
Great Grandma . 
it's Naima's hand+print . 
and it says +... 
n@l a@l i@l m@l a@l . 
elephant ? 
does that spell elephant ? 
are you hungry ? 
I thought you were gonna help wrap presents anyway . 
alright . 
well +... 
xxx (.) looking for my wrapping paper . 
yeah: [: yes] . 
that's what I'm talking about . 
you can stomp but +... 
&-um: (.) just +... 
if you want something you can use your regular voice to ask me . 
okay . 
there's Naima and we're gonna wrap presents . 
alright . 
this is gonna go right here . 
I'm gonna cut you some paper . 
alright ? 
I think so . 
make sure this is gonna be the right size . 
let's see: . 
oh yes , that should be enough . 
okay . 
do you remember how we did it earlier today ? 
you fold one end up and then the next end . 
yep [: yes] . 
you do it yourself . 
by (.) fold you rub . 
see where my finger is ? 
rub it with your whole hand . 
to make it (.) crease . 
good ! 
and then you fold this half down . 
and then make a crease with your hand all the way here . 
le(t) me show you . 
sli:de your hand , like that . 
there . 
okay . 
wanna put some tape on ? 
you want another piece ? 
I think Grandma xxx really gonna like this present . 
good . 
here's another one . 
here's another piece . 
(o)kay . 
put a piece right here where this white part is . 
but so that it covers the edge of the paper . 
alright . 
we turn it around +... 
and then it's time to make the triangles . 
there's one triangle . 
take the corner . 
fold it way up . 
way up like that . 
good ! 
you did . 
and then you fold the whole thing up . 
fold both triangles up . 
like that . 
and then you tape that part . 
this is like a flap isn't it ? 
you attach the flap . 
to the present with the tape . 
and then +... 
you turn it all the way around gently . 
so that this is the edge that you make the triangles on now . 
so: let's make triangles here . 
one here +... 
we:ll (.) let go for a sec . 
take the corner . 
bring it up to where the edge of the present inside the wrapping is . 
and then what do you do , d(o) you remember ? 
you bring this edge wa:y up . 
that's right . 
yeah and then tape . 
le(t) me get my tape . 
yeah (.) gotta hold it down . 
well you xxx mostly wanna tape the flap to +... 
the main part of the present . 
to the big part of the present . 
so that the flap stays down . 
yep [: yes] . 
(o)kay . 
that's on my finger isn't it ? 
here . 
good . 
you don't need too much , just need enough to keep the flap down , it doesn't hafta be +... 
that amount of sticking up is actually okay . 
okay . 
now +... 
turn it (.) so that the tape is on the bottom . 
yeah that's the present for Grandma , it look very nice . 
now I'm gonna put this box together to wrap the hat and gloves for Grandma . 
the hat I got for my mom . 
yes . 
I hope she (.) will wear it . 
and this is: +... 
these are the gloves . 
purple gloves . 
a:nd I think what I wanna do: +... 
is: +... 
I wanna +... 
no , maybe that won't work . 
I guess I'm gonna put the gloves inside the hat . 
and then +... 
wrap it a little bit like this . 
and put it in the box . 
xxx . 
and then we'll wrap the box in some wrapping paper . 
think I'll +... 
tape the box just a little bit closed . 
to make sure it stays closed . 
okay , can you put that tape right there ? 
right here . 
right at the edge . 
yep [: yes] and rub it . 
so that closes the box . 
now we need wrapping paper . 
&-um: . 
&-um: . 
I think we use the gold wrapping paper . 
okay . 
yep [: yes] you're gonna help but le(t) me cut the right size of paper first . 
oh the weather outside is frightful: . 
with the wrong (.) notes . 
because that's a song that I can never remember the right notes to . 
okay this is our piece of paper for this box . 
do you remember what the first thing we should do is ? 
well the first thing we do +... 
the nice side of the wrapping paper , the side we want to show , is actually on the floor . 
the white part . 
and then we put our present (.) down on the wrapping paper . 
do you remember what we do ? 
you take your end of the paper . 
well we don't do the triangles just yet . 
take this in one hand . 
bring the paper right up here . 
onto the box . 
not triangles . 
just bring all the paper . 
right up onto the box . 
I'm holding this one down . 
so we're gonna cover +... 
here's some tape . 
cover the box . 
with the paper . 
yep [: yes] go ahead and put the (.) tape right there that's good . 
and I'll put a piece there and I think we need one more little piece . 
right at the end . 
good . 
the secret to good wrapping is not to use too much tape I think . 
this is a box so it's a little different . 
our triangle's gonna look like that . 
and like that . 
now can you bring this up onto the main part of the box ? 
pull up and then over . 
it's different from wrapping something flat . 
(o)kay I'm holding this , will you put some tape ? 
we don't wanna cover all the edges with tape , we just wanna use +... 
a small +... 
amount . 
teeny tiny pieces of tape . 
would you put that one over there ? 
goo:d okay . 
and I'll put one here . 
and now I'm gonna bring it aro:und . 
make some triangles on this side . 
don't use it until I tell you okay ? 
where's the triangles . 
and then folding it up . 
bringing it over . 
there . 
right on the edge and I'll put one little piece right here too . 
and that's done . 
well we have a lot more to wrap but we need to make sure we la:bel these and (.) and wrap them with ribbons and things so that +... 
&-uh (.) so that (.) we know who they're for . 
(be)cause that's important too , isn't it ? 
I wonder if I put all my ribbons and other things in some stra:nge location . 
xxx I'm gonna look in the closet over here . 
to see if the +... 
somehow got over here by accident . 
oh I think that's the supper: that's ready . 
(be)cause &-uh Daddy and I &-um +... 
put supper in the oven to heat up . 
just a sec(ond) boo boo . 
maybe I put it in here . 
nope [: no] I guess not . 
hm: . 
well that's alright we're just gonna make a little tag for Grandma that says +... 
Grandma xxx ! 
let's see , maybe I'll use the pinking shears . 
should I make a circle ? 
a:nd maybe a +... 
how (a)bout if I make a +... 
xxx I bet she'd like that . 
that's what this is for . 
for: +... 
for: +... 
Grandma: . 
actually I'm gonna write merry Christmas from Naima , okay: ? 
is that okay ? 
merry: +... 
Christmas . 
from: +... 
Nai:m:a: . 
it says , for Grandma +... 
merry Christmas +... 
from Naima . 
I might add an exclamation point . 
okay would you like to tape that +..? 
to the top of the package there ? 
bring your picture over . 
take this . 
you wanna tape it right on . 
you have two pieces , one for each si:de . 
what I mean is one for each edge . 
you can decide where you wanna put it . 
decide where on the package you wanna put it . 
o:kay . 
I would put that (.) piece there . 
if I were you . 
excellent . 
that's great . 
and this present +... 
is from all of us . 
fo:r +... 
Mo:m . 
and then I'm gonna say , parentheses +... 
Grandma . 
fro:m . 
xxx . 
and then I'm gonna write in parentheses , a:nd also +... 
from xxx and xxx . 
and Naima . 
and then I'm gonna tape that . 
I'm gonna fold the tape +... 
and make it almost like a piece of glue . 
so that this becomes like a sticker . 
now: . 
these presents can go under the tree . 
wanna put them under the tree ? 
and carry them over there ? 
you've got a little +... 
thing here , okay . 
bring (th)em over this way . 
le(t) me take this Diwali thing out of the way . 
okay , go ahead honey . 
and this one too . 
great ! 
o:kay . 
come on back over here . 
I think I'm gonna take a break from wrapping so that we can all have dinner . 
would you like to do that ? 
okay . 
do you think that you could go down and tell Daddy that dinner is ready ? 
wait where ? 
rough and smooth ? 
like a long time and then a short time . 
I thought the cookies were . 
&-um (.) whole then crumbled . 
xxx . 
how (a)bout +..? 
curly and straight . 
go:od . 
hm: ? 
or bitter . 
because you can have something that's not salty , that's unsalted but it's not necessarily sweet . 
I know how many tastes there are . 
I'm aware of that one too but +... 
I still think sweet +... 
xxx I agree that either bitter or sour but I don't think that salty +... 
I'll grant you that . 
you know what , you can have a camel cookie , but I would like you to have some fruit too . 
would you like some apple ? 
no I don't think so . 
xxx . 
what Naima ? 
Naima do you like the peel ? 
oh I see . 
well you can do what xxx . 
would you like some ? 
it's fiber . 
easily . 
if you eat all that apple +... 
and you're still hungry +... 
after you eat all that apple +... 
then you can have camel . 
&-uh yeah . 
can you use any help down there Daddy ? 
no ? 
here's hoping . 
Naima's cookies just came out . 
they hafta cool down . 
xxx . 
&-um: . 
I'm gonna try and look for that wrapping paper . 
well did you see what I +... 
is that enough ? 
because we actually have a B I G thing that +... 
I just +... 
I think I used it when I was wrapping right before we left . 
so maybe it's behind the couch or something like that . 
the sleepy bear that went to Alaska ? 
mhm .
