yeah . 
pa pig bought a new car to give to Ma pig on her birthday . 
she will certainly be surprised when she sees her new car , won't she ? 
oh this is the car store , over here . 
on the way home pa stopped at a drug store , when he came out he got into a jeep . 
by mistake , see the jeep , it's a green jeep . 
you should be wearing your glasses , pa pig . 
Harry and Sally thought that pa had swapped cars with a soldier . 
then he went to the supermarket . 
when he came out he got into a police car . 
you made a good swap Daddy said Harry but pa wasn't listening and he didn't seemed to be thinking very well either , don't you agree ? 
ha look at that police fox . 
sto:p ! 
that's (.) the pig family in a police car . 
driving a police car . 
oh the police fox is chasing them that's right . 
next he drove to a fruit stand to buy some apples . 
when he left he took farmer fox's tractor . 
oh there's the tractor . 
it's red . 
ma: will certainly like her new tractor , said Sally to Harry . 
they stopped to watch a fire . 
when the fire was up they left in the fire engine . 
how can anyone make so many mistakes ? 
and now what's happening ? 
then they stopped to watch some workers who digging a big hole in the ground . 
no , pa did not get into that dump truck by but by mistake he got into ha he drove the car into the ho:le . 
oh brother . 
oh no he went into Roger Rhino's power shovel . 
Ma_Pig was certainly surprised to see her new ca:r . 
it looks as though he is very angry , that means mad . 
with that someone who took his power shovel . 
does he look mad to you ? 
they are feeling a little bit worried , I think . 
Roger please be careful , you're squeezing ma's little car just a little bit too tightly . 
well , let's all hope that pa pig will never again make that many mistakes in one (.) day . 
pa pig took the steam shovel by accident . 
it's over here . 
she is very surprised and looks like Loly Worm's right here in the maw of the steam shovel . 
she's very surprised . 
the steam shovel is almost knocking her over . 
by accident . 
those are the pig children , they are watching (.) their daddy drive the steam shovel . 
let's see what else's in the here . 
these are different stories . 
I wanna look for a different story . 
the story is called the talking (.) bread . 
Humper Dink the baker was mixing bread dough with the help of able baker Charlie Mouse . 
this little girl Flossy watch them squish and squash the dough . 
they are making dough for bread . 
yes , I use a rolling pin when I make bread . 
they are kneading the dough . 
they patted it into loaves of all different shapes and sizes . 
that's the oven . 
okay , what happens over here ? 
there must be twenty loaves of bread there . 
after the loaves had finished baking Humper Dink set them out on the table to cool . 
oh here , you're right on Mommy's microphone , I didn't realize that . 
mm mm mm , fresh bread smells good . 
Mama , Humper Dink says , Mama . 
let me just adjust this , okay , okay . 
Mama . 
Mama . 
finally he took out the last loaf . 
listen , did you hear that one when he pick that loaf , it said , oh it said , Mama . 
huh , but everybody knows that bread can't talk . 
the bread is talking , Naima . 
it must be haunted . 
huh help poli:ce , Humper Dink picked up Flossy and ran from the room . 
I must telephone Sargent_Murphy , he said . 
that's the police dog . 
arrived in a hurry . 
he (.) is (.) driving the motorcycle without his shoes on and his shoes are tied to the end of the motorcycle . 
cause [: because] he was in such a hurry . 
he reached down and picked up the loaf of haunted bread . 
oh_my_goodness , the bread is saying , Mama . 
the bread is talking . 
Murphy was so startled he fell into the mixing trough . 
look at what a mess he is , huh . 
at just that moment Huckle and Loly came into the bakery . 
somebody had better get him out , he is going to be all sticky , and messy , and gooey . 
yep [: yes] . 
he's ooching [: scooching] across the floor . 
he took a nibble , the bread said nothing , he nibbled and nibbled til [: until] only his foot showing . 
oh_my_goodness . 
Loly stood up . 
that's Loly and the bread is on top of him . 
Humper Dink gently broke open the bread and inside was (.) huh , Flossy's doll . 
Mama . 
baby , she says . 
it had fallen into the mixing trough and had been baked inside the bread . 
he is opening the bread and finding a doll inside the bread . 
oh with mystery solved they all sat down to eat the haunted bread , all of them that is except Loly . 
that means he is going toward the bread . 
ooching [: scooching] . 
he's ooching [: scooching] . 
yes , in this case it means he's walking , he's a worm so he ooches [: scooches] . 
he is (.) taking a nibble . 
he's standing up with the bread on top of him , and the bread is saying Mama . 
he's standing up , sticking his head out of the bread . 
you do that sometimes , I've seen you ooch [: scooch] , you ooch [: scooch] . 
you ooch [: scooch] around . 
it sort of means crawling . 
ooching [: scooching] . 
he's ooching [: scooching] . 
what is the bread saying , do you remember ? 
it's talking , that bread is talking . 
oh the pig opens the bread and gets the doll out . 
in this picture he's ooching [: scooching] toward the bread . 
he's nibbling , and nibbling , and nibbling . 
oh_my_goodness , look at this . 
better keep your eyes on the road , Harvey . 
well , he didn't keep his eyes on the road and he had an accident . 
he bumped into that other (.) car , which is actually a taxi (.) taxi car . 
the pig is driving the pink car (.) and getting into an accident with a taxi . 
Loly Worm is riding in that taxi . 
o:h I don't think so , I think he's here , he wears a helmet .
