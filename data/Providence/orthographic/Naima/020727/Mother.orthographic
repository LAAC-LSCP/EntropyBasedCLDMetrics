well I need to (.) put it in a lot of water to wash it really nicely . 
to make sure that (.) the mustard greens get very clean cause [: because] we're going to cook them and eat them .

I think that's another hazel nut . 
the ice+cube tray has more than twelve and the (.) muffin tin has twelve (.) places for twelve muffins . 
xxx and I need some salt . 
just a second , honey . 
let me see . 
I don't remember . 
usually when I buy nuts they already have the (.) shells taken off of them . 
let's [: let us] see .

you have matching +//. 
why don't you put all the nuts that match in one container and all the (.) nuts that look alike xxx with the dark brown in that container +... 
no , I mean you put all the ones that like like this in here , put all the ones that look like that +//. 
I see . 
xxx , if you want to do that . 
but a bi:rd or , let's [: let us] see , some other kind of animal with strong teeth could probably do it . 
cause [: because] I don't know everything , and I don't know everything about every kind of bird . 
I only know some things about some kinds of birds . 
I think chickadees do eat insects . 
if I'm not mistaken . 
do you wanna take the nuts and play with them down on the floor ? 
&-um (.) do you wanna help make cookies ? 
okay . 
let's [: let us] see , to do that you will need definitely to (.) wash hands . 
I think we'll save them in a good +//. 
let's [: let us] put all the nuts i:n (.) a yogurt container . 
why don't you put them all in there , and then +//. 
and then I will help you put the top on it .

Mommy does , too . 
cause [: because] it makes the food taste good .

whoa . 
xxx , the top wasn't on . 
are you making one or two of these ? 
here's some more nuts . 
let me see this +//. 
there , try that . 
you know what , it sounds a little different every time you put more (.) or less nuts in it . 
that one will sound empty I bet . 
xxx , but you know what might sound different , if you put something really small in there like some of your beans . 
let's [: let us] put beans in one of them and see what it sounds like . 
and close it , close it up real tight . 
there . 
that does sound different . 
the nuts ? 
nu:ts . 
who says nu:ts ? 
what did I put in here ? 
cornmeal . 
whoop .

but we need to make the dough first . 
o:h . 
okay you're gonna need to pick +//. 
I'll help you get down . 
and you need to put them away or play with them in the living+room . 
I don't want them on the floor there . 
I'm gonna count to ten , then you're gonna pick up the ones that are on the floor . 
do you need help getting down ? 
and then I'll give you the top after you collect all your nuts . 
you're collecting nuts just like a squirrel does . 
and then I will let you help me make the cookies if you would like to . 
you're doing a good job picking those up , Naima . 
and there's some up on the table , too . 
wanna get those ? 
you want me to help put that on then you could shake it ? 
I guess we're gonna turn off the tape .
