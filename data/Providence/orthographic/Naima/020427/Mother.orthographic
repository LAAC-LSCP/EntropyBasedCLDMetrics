oh there's Mr and Mrs Mallard they're looking for a place to live . 
I think maybe they're gonna have some chicks . 
so they're trying to figure out where's a good place to build our nest . 
you wouldn't wanna build a nest in someone's bath room .

let see what happens to them . 
when they go to Boston xxx oh boy .

let's ask let see if bird children know the answer to that question . 
well I wouldn't wanna build a nest right near some foxes . 
and I wouldn't wanna live in a nest where there wasn't any food near by . 
and I wouldn't wanna build a nest next to a play ground where there're lots_of noisy children all the time . 
I wouldn't build a nest in a refrigerator . 
it will be to cold . 
because that's what birds really speak . 
why Naima ? 
oh I wouldn't wanna build a nest right next to a bear . 
that would be scary . 
I wouldn't wanna build a nest on an airplane . 
I definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a cat . 
I definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a dog yikes yikes yikes . 
that would be an a noisy annoying noise for the birds wouldn't it ? 
near a duck .

may be it'll be okay [: big yawn] to build a nest near a duck . 
should we read the rest of the story ? 
hey that's the same did you hear the noise out there ?

and here are the children riding bicycles the birds better watch out . 
those ducks better watch out so the bicycles don't run them over . 
oh_my_goodness they almost ran them right over . 
hm: so they flew over beacon hill around the state house but there was no place there . 
they looked in Lewisburg_Square but there was no water to swim in . 
xxx they flew over the Charles_River .

ducklings really those are ducklings .

that's how they get around they swim and that's how they look for food in the water . 
here they're they're lining up . 
she's teaching them to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels . 
and that cars are dangerous she's she's teaching them the same thing she's saying cars and bicycles and other things on wheels are dangerous cause they can bump into you . 
that's just what Mommy taught you Naima .
