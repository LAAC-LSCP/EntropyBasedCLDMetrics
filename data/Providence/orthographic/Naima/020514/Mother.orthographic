you want something to put the tree on ? 
whoop . 
that's because that's in the way . 
here . 
okay . 
yeah . 
mm . 
you know , I think we need to stabilize it . 
like that . 
you can put things on there . 
there . 
and I bet this would also stabilize it if we put this right here . 
then it won't fall so easily . 
you wanna put it on top of this ? 
okay . 
he's gonna be so happy . 
it's so nice when someone gives you a present . 
sometimes people give presents on birthdays (.) or holidays , but sometimes (.) people give each other presents just 'cause [: because] they want to .

babilize@c .

how about if we made one that was a little more stable and it wouldn't fall down as easily ? 
wait a m(inute) +//. 
we can still make it tall .

bweeleelee@c . 
Sleepy Bear wants to know what that means . 
bweeleelee@c ? 
he used to say those things when he +//. 
oh , you're using those words ? 
is he saying thank you ? 
mm . 
he is ? 
when you're first making it ? 
want me to stabilize it ?

socket .

you don't know why you did ? 
you want some breakfast ? 
do you wanna eat pancakes ? 
with blueberries inside them ? 
oh , really ? 
I didn't realize that . 
oh , well Naima could have just pancakes with the blueberries in them and eat them like muffins .

that are in the fridge . 
do you want to have some yogurt ? 
the Stitchta_Bear is loofing@c ?

budging up ? 
he's watching what ? 
he pinches his mommy ? 
he's pinching you , I see that now . 
you could say +//. 
'cause [: because] if he's a toddler bear he needs to learn what the rules are and how to be with people , like you don't pinch people and you don't hit people . 
what're you gonna tell him ? 
right , you still can say it in a nice way but he still needs to learn . 
oh , no . 
you don't wanna hurt your bear . 
sounds like the b(order) +//. 
Saint Stephen xxx is gotten very slowed down . 
did you read this article ?

it wasn't , it was before . 
I have a feeling it's really +... 
the bear's [: bear is] in the chair ? 
are you in the chair ? 
the backpack and (.) I'm gonna find your kiwi and then I'm gonna slice it so my hands are gonna actually be fairly busy . 
do you wanna sit here at this table , Naima ? 
you're stabilizing those towers ?

okay . 
oh , a very xxx , you mean +//. 
well to come this far up most people will wanna spend more than a weekend . 
mhm .

I thought Daddy said he was gonna sit with you . 
what do you want me to do ? 
can I help ? 
can I make a suggestion ? 
you don't wanna hear my idea ? 
alright , then I won't tell you my idea . 
you don't need to hear what you think +//? 
because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego . 
see how this is wider ? 
if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable . 
see this is wider (.) and this is skinny and narrow . 
if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable . 
yeah , even that is better . 
that , if I were you I'd put that on the bottom . 
'cause [: because] that's really stable , that's like a platform . 
it's a pretty big tower though . 
and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand , that also helps . 
to keep it more stable . 
shall we have a civilized breakfast together ? 
do you wanna have breakfast together ? 
xxx . 
she needs to pung@c it back , Daddy . 
how 'bout [: about] if we stabilize it by putting it on that ? 
you don't think so ? 
you hold it . 
see . 
'cause [: because] it's sort of uneven . 
things would be more stable on that floor which is much more flat . 
see , this is an uneven floor . 
well I meant this kind of +//. 
we'll put this up here . 
what's who gonna try and do ? 
oh . 
she's making these as presents for Sleepy Bear . 
he's a lucky bear . 
here's some kiwi: . 
oh you're right , there's hardly any syrup . 
do we have a syrup mouse in the house ? 
well I think it's enough for us to split that last pancake that was (.) from yesterday . 
and then we can have toast also . 
I mean , since we're +//. 
half used food things . 
oh , the chair is there . 
her special puffin (.) place mat is up there . 
okay . 
yeah . 
okay , this is just barely warm , but +... 
Naima , do you want some pancake too ? 
yeah . 
it's right here . 
it's like a blueberry muffin , that's what I thought . 
is it also like a muffin shape ? 
hm: . 
you wanna split this with me ? 
I think there's enough syrup for this . 
hm: ? 
oh , xxx . 
xxx . 
what , xxx . 
it says that ? 
0are you trying to find the most expensive +..? 
here , have your pancake . 
do you want some soy milk or skim milk ? 
yes , I saw the fly . 
mhm , that would be fun . 
is it good ? 
it's all gone , I'm sorry . 
you could have (.) a baby yogurt +... 
mhm . 
I'm gonna go xxx fiddle with the laundry . 
xxx . 
uhoh . 
this blueberry jam has not been refrigerated . 
I guess , but I'm gonna put it in the fridge now . 
&-um , what was I thinking +//? 
we should try to visit the organic blueberry farm down the road . 
is it on +//? 
because , otherwise we should call Gramps' . 
and give them a little heads+up . 
if we're gonna do that . 
yeah . 
well , and I wonder if they're at the Blue Hill Fair . 
marketing or anything . 
which starts tonight actually , as far as I can tell . 
so +... 
the proble(m) +... 
to ? 
&-uh , yeah but I think that trip to the Blue Hill Fair would be , &-uh +... 
'cause [: because] we're gonna be under a lot of pressure to get +... 
yeah . 
is that a reasonable stop ? 
okay , well +... 
is that a good breakfast , Naima ? 
yeah . 
it's good . 
not overly sweet . 
xxx we could read that after breakfast . 
well , I'm not gonna read it 'cause [: because] I'm eating my breakfast . 
xxx , Sal and her mother take some pails (.) and go to Blueberry Hill , don't they ? 
why do they want to +//. 
that's right . 
her mother wants to can blueberries for next winter . 
that means +... 
I know it probably sounds like it means put them in cans but it means put them in jars . 
like to make jam . 
on the stove , and put it in jars , and then store it , keep it , so that they will have blueberries all year round . 
we do that too except we put the blueberries in the freezer . 
so we have them all year round . 
almost all year round . 
this is the time of year when people who have blueberry fields pick their blueberries . 
in fact , that's probably a reason why they aren't at the Blue Hill Fair , because , 'cause [: because] , it's probably peak time for picking . 
or maybe +... 
oh , little Sal finds mother crow and her children ? 
little bear finds a mother partridge , I think you're right . 
xxx . 
mother +//. 
the mother bear and little bear +... 
a:nd the mother partridge and the mother crow +... 
and their children . 
I think that's all . 
who else ? 
Little Bear , are you eating your blueberries ? 
gesundheit . 
gesundheit , gesundheit ! 
for two sneezes . 
oop . 
you need your spoon ? 
I'll wash it . 
xxx kiwi seeds . 
we could do Cobb's Cook in the afternoon . 
I just wanna take a shower before I go out but +... 
you wanna go on a hike this morning , Naima ? 
you wanna go on a hike with Mommy ? 
hm: ? 
sour yogurt . 
all that +//. 
mhm . 
I think you dropped some blueberries out of the spoon . 
can you pick up the ones that're [: that are] on the mat now and put them +... 
Naima , you know what you're doing now ? 
you're making a mess . 
and that goes for these over here too . 
these ones . 
good . 
over here . 
thank you for cleaning up those blueberries , now you can eat them ! 
in fact ? 
yeah , that's where we're gonna do our hiking . 
we can be bears . 
in the woods . 
I wonder if I should bring the (.) backpack . 
it's a little hard to do it if +//. 
you would like to hike on your own just walking , wouldn't you ? 
that was a nice hike we did . 
is something in your mouth ? 
blueberry skin ? 
oh , is that the first time you're having the honey ? 
0remember where we used to get crystallized honey all the time ? 
yep [: yes] . 
0it 0would be nice to maybe bring back home some blueberry honey . 
we could maybe get a bigger thing , or (.) some more . 
I think I got that in Eastport . 
but , there must be +... 
y'know [: you know] . 
0it must be all over .
