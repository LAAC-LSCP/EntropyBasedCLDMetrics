all the men shave except for three who have beards . 
two of them trim .

yeah he does look like he needs a trim doesn't he ? 
they are giving them to themselves trims right ? 
yeah . 
he looks like he could use a little trim . 
I guess he likes his hair long like that . 
yeah some of the men wear teeshirt undershirts with sleeves and some with undershirts without sleeves . 
and a few of the ninety two do not wear undershirts at all . 
the night and the temperature are falling and one thin man buttons up a suit of long sleeve long legged underwear . 
all of the men put on black socks . 
there are short socks and long socks and fancy silk socks and that have decorations called clocks . 
I think that's what that is . 
some of the men wear leg garters to keep their long socks from falling down around their ankles . 
hm: . 
the man with the long beard has a whole in his sock I think . 
yeah . 
the thirteen women put on different kinds of complicated underwear . 
underpants panty+hose stockings petticoats slips and bras . 
one woman who's feet always freeze puts on wool socks over her stockings .

each pair of pants has a shiny black stripe down the outside of each leg . 
the men zip zippers and button a button or two . 
one man has wavy black hair streaked with white like lightning . 
he puts on a very soft white shirt with ruffles down the front . 
it has special cuffs that fasten with cuff+links . 
this man hooks a wide black cloth belt around his waist . 
the belt is called a cummerbund .

they wear black tops sweaters or blouses . 
four women put on a long four women put on long black dresses and one wears a black jumper over a black shirt .

bracelets would get in the way when they're working . 
hm: .

what is she playing ? 
mm it's a bigger one though so I think it's probably a cello or a bass . 
yeah I think you're right . 
all the men put on black bow+ties some tie them on in front of mirrors and some stare into space and tie them . 
the thin man whistles a tune as he ties his tie . 
twenty seven men have clip+on ties that are already made into bows the man with the wavy black and white hair (.) the ruffly shirt and the cummerbund ties on a very big white bow+tie . 
it looks like a white bat . 
no one else has a tie like this he slips on a white vest and then a black jacket that is short in the front and long in the back where it divides in two like black beetle wings .

he walks to the front of the stage and steps one step up onto a box called a +... 
podium . 
there he can be seen very clearly by the one hundred and four people on the stage and by the hundreds of people in the audience . 
the audience applauds . 
the man bows . 
he is the conductor the leader of the orchestra and he holds a stick in his hand .

thank you . 
oh thank you . 
alrighty . 
xxx . 
huh what's that ? 
a woolly mammoth . 
sure . 
woolly mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the woolly mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall . 
and appeared about two million years ago during the Ice_Age (.) of the Pleistocene epoch . 
right what was the one that we saw at the Pequot museum remember we saw one ? 
oh the mastodon . 
right ? 
looks similar . 
right . 
during the Ice_Age massive ice sheets called glaciers covered vast areas of land . 
xxx . 
crash . 
yeah I think so . 
boom . 
it's ears were very small . 
it's long curved tusks enabled it to find food by clearing away snow and ice . 
woolly mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia . 
prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals . 
very long . 
huh who's this ? 
the saber+tooth tigers first appeared sometime between twenty six and thirty six million years ago . 
oh my gosh his tusks are going in his mouth . 
xxx . 
there we go . 
the scientific name for the saber tooth tiger is (.) &makeri Machairodont Machairodont Machairodont ? 
does that sound better ? 
you think Machairodont ? 
this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws . 
these cats were carnivores or meat eaters and use their sharp xxx sharp teeth to pierce the thick skins of the plant eating animals . 
one of the best know saber+tooth tigers is the Smiladon which means knife tooth in Latin . 
exact . 
yeah Smiladon sounds like mastodon . 
they're both Latin names . 
hello smarty+pants . 
the Machrauchenia . 
wow . 
Machrauchenia means large throat . 
achoo . 
achoo . 
the Machrauchenia was about eleven feet tall and was shaped like a camel but with no humps . 
fossils show that its nose openings were high up on the skull suggesting that it had some sort of trunk . 
it woulduv [: would have] used its trunk as an elephant does today to obtain food and water . 
since each of its toes were hoofed Machrauchenia would've [: would have] been able to run quickly to escape predators . 
huh what's this ? 
that is the Brontotherium . 
&-uh it sounds like a brontosaurus right . 
what animal does the Brontotherium look like ? 
kinduv [: kind of] like a hippo kinduv [: kind of] like a rhinoceros . 
yeah I think so . 
Brontotherium was a plant eater that grew up to eight feet tall . 
although it looked like a modern day rhinoceros the two animals are only distantly related . 
Brontotherium lived in the warm forest and had a large forked horn on its snout that was shaped like a y@l do you see its horn ? 
yeah here's the y@l shaped one now up here see . 
that's his nose . 
his snout . 
okay what comes next ? 
wow this is a Thorahockis . 
yes ? 
that one goes xxx xxx xxx . 
oh the woolly mammoth ? 
he goes xxx . 
hello I'm a woolly mammoth . 
xxx I'm a saber+tooth tiger . 
I'm a tiger . 
you're right . 
right I'm a Machrauchenia . 
what's that ? 
that's the Brontotherium . 
I'm a Brontotherium . 
hello I'm a Thorahockis . 
like kkinduv [: kind of] like an ostrich right ? 
yeah or an emu . 
right . 
hello I'm a bird . 
xxx . 
hello I'm a giant sloth . 
wow that is one big sloth huh ? 
yeah let's see what it says about the sloth here . 
it says the giant sloth was tru:ly hu:ge about twenty feet long from nose to tail . 
I'm huge . 
let's see this one says we're strange creatures . 
the woolly mammoth says I have long tusks and wooly hair . 
that one says the wooly hair has the woolly mammoth has long shaggy hair and is just thirteen feet tall . 
this one says the saber+tooth tiger has long pointy fangs . 
xxx . 
this one says the Machrauchenia has a long trunklike nose . 
the Brontotherium says that the Brontotherium ate leaves and fruit from the trees . 
the Thorahockis says that the birds could not fly they ran on their feet . 
the Machrauchenia says I have a long nose . 
it says that the Machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps . 
the Brontotherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns . 
this one says that there were lots_of unusual creatures (.) that roamed the earth many many years ago . 
it says the woolly mammoth had pretty small ears . 
that says that the woolly mammoth lived during the Ice_Age . 
it says that one of the saber+tooth tigers was called a Smiladon . 
it had long knife like teeth which were over six inches long . 
the Machrauchenia says that it ate plants . 
and a long trunk like nose . 
wow . 
achoo . 
achoo . 
the Brontotherium says they had a y@l shaped forked horn on the top of their snout . 
the Thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings . 
because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs . 
yummy . 
huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue . 
but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult . 
yeah . 
the giant sloth probably only became extinct about eleven million years ago . 
interesting . 
mhm . 
that is a neat book . 
yeah . 
well it says that lots_of interesting creatures roamed the earth millions of years ago . 
ah the giant sloth . 
he says I'm truly huge . 
yeah: [: yes] . 
the Machrauchenia . 
oh my gosh is that a rhinoceros ? 
the Brontotherium . 
oh is that an ostrich ? 
that's a Thorahockis you're right . 
oh my gosh that's truly huge what is it ? 
hm: .
