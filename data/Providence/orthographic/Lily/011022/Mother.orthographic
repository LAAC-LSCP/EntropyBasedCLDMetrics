and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all . 
and all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat . 
but the wild things cried oh please don't go , we'll eat you up we love you so . 
the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws .
