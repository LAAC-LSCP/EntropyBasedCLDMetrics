and what else did we see ?

and we see the busts ? 
and did we see that very pretty bust of a woman ? 
it was all white . 
made of marble . 
and Norman the doorman likes (.) likes busts . 
right and Norman the doorman works at the museum in the blue book . 
you wanna go get another book ?

oh look at that .

and I'll go get Norman the doorman . 
with Norman the doorman . 
yay ! 
lots_of books . 
lots (.) of books . 
what book is that ? 
Lulu . 
Norman the doorman . 
you wanna read Norman . 
Norman . 
okay . 
okay . 
in front of a small well hidden hole . 
around and back of the majestic museum of art there once stood a mouse named ? 
Norman . 
Norman was a doorman . 
she's wearing a dress . 
oh I think he's wearing a lil [: little] scarf . 
on his neck . 
he greeted all the art loving creatures . 
who came to see the treasures . 
which were kept in the basement of the museum . 
a lil [: little] scarf . 
and a dress . 
right ? 
right a scarf . 
oo what do you see ? 
we saw a white bust in the museum here right . 
Norman would explain every painting in detail . 
a sad clown and a statue you're right . 
he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself . 
he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of Greek sculpture . 
which rested in the dark corners of the storage room . 
she is wearing quite a snazzy dress I think . 
as oh we missed a page . 
Norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard . 
who often came to the basement to set traps for mice . 
I know they're running away from the guard . 
as for Norman he always managed to escape . 
and hide inside an old armored knights helmet . 
up there he felt perfectly safe . 
actually the helmet was Norman's home . 
which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio . 
just see what a splendid sky light the visor made . 
like most everybody Norman had a hobby . 
each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful . 
perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue . 
one bitter cold day Norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire . 
I know he's making something out of wire . 
it's a mouse trap . 
and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right ? 
he made a trapeze . 
that's right . 
all through the day and far into the night Norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes . 
until at last he created something he was really proud of . 
it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze . 
oh yes . 
that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse . 
early next morning when Norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway . 
he noticed a man reading a sign nearby . 
he read the sign to . 
sculpture contest . 
open to all artists great and small . 
last day today . 
back he flew . 
why can't I show my wire statue he said . 
as he slid through the visor opening . 
but what would he call it . 
all pieces must have a title he well knew . 
suddenly he had an inspiration . 
stripping off the printed word trap from the label and ripping off the letters eese@q from the word cheese he pasted them together . 
trapeze . 
now he had a fitting title for his wire work . 
although Norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat . 
then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces . 
there the mouse is hiding there under the cover . 
up the snowy staircase he climbed . 
once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another . 
there's a bust you're right . 
the other bust is sad ? 
yes . 
the accordion right . 
you're right . 
what's this ? 
is that a statue of a woman dancing ? 
she looks like she's having a good time . 
don't you think ? 
yes . 
and there's a statue of a man riding a horse . 
and a statue of a lil [: little] boy and girl holding a balloon . 
after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work . 
out he went into the snowy afternoon knowing he had done his best . 
you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do . 
she is wearing a dress . 
oh another dress . 
two dresses what color are they ? 
yellow and pink . 
meanwhile upstairs in the sculpture gallery of the museum . 
the judges were busy judging . 
oh ! 
there it is . 
quietly and seriously they examined each piece . 
trying to find which ones deserved prizes . 
gradually they found themselves huddled around a certain statue . 
now this is an [: and] amazing creation exclaimed one . 
there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny . 
yes but remember the contest is open to great and small . 
one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not I . 
the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist . 
but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped . 
so this is where my mouse traps have been going . 
I think I know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher . 
and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement . 
what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet . 
he lifted up the visor to investigate . 
there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps . 
and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse . 
whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard . 
during all this time Norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman . 
a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting . 
was long passed due . 
and he was getting mighty cold and hungry . 
but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard . 
there you are said the guard as Norman fled inside . 
but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole Norman sniffed it . 
he couldn't help poking his nose out to get a better whiff . 
and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught Norman by the tail . 
are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard . 
it's just my hobby said Norman . 
it's just my hobby . 
oh there having a big party . 
the guard tossed Norman up on his shoulder . 
Norman was sure he was being taken to jail . 
you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze . 
hooray for trapeze ! 
why I'll be bamboozled cried the guard . 
I do believe you've won a prize . 
the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly . 
here's the winner I found him freezing in the snow . 
indeed said the head judge . 
why yes who else would could have created the daring mouse on the trapeze . 
what is your name my good fellow ? 
and what would you like for your prize ? 
if you please sir my name is Norman . 
and I'm the doorman downstairs . 
and I've always dreamed of seeing the upstairs of the museum without getting caught . 
that's what I'd like best . 
there's a bust . 
and that's (.) that's a knight with his armor on . 
the guard led Norman out into the hall . 
where together they began a grand tour of the entire art museum . 
later that night when Norman returned from returned to his door . 
he found his mice friends from the country waiting for him . 
of course Norman invited them in where he shared with them an enormous slice of cheese . 
a present given to him from the warm hearted guard . 
what a wonderful way to end the day .

oo boy what's he cooking ? 
yummy . 
so did I tell you Manuela ? 
that there you know they come up with all this information now about tuna . 
that women of child bearing age shouldn't eat more than a certain amount of tuna because it has mercury in it . 
and so pregnant women or people planning to get pregnant shouldn't eat that much tuna and young children and whatever . 
so she loves it . 
so &-um although not with mayonnaise . 
only eats tuna in olive oil . 
like she eats italian tuna in olive oil and salt . 
I know . 
oh she wearing a dress too ? 
so I called I kept meaning to ask the pediatrician and I forgot to ask her when we were there for our two year appointment . 
so I called one day and it's a big practice . 
and you know a bunch of doctors running around .

oh I'm sorry angel . 
I'm sorry . 
did I just scratch your lil [: little] nose ? 
does that feel better ? 
oh good . 
(be)cause she wants everyday for lunch can we have tuna ? 
so I've only been I've been trying to give it to her once a week . 
and she'll eat like a three ounce can . 
but even that I'm like it's so hard to wait a whole week to give it to her (be)cause she wants it . 
so this is what they're recommending for (.) that an adult female shouldn't have like should have a can (be)cause a big a regular size can of tuna is six ounces . 
I know . 
I eat it too . 
I know . 
and young kids but I guess the mercury will affect brain development . 
potentially .
