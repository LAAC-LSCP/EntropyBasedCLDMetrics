should we read Harold's Trip to the Sky ? 
one night Harold got up , made sure there was a moon so he wouldn't see things in the dark +... 
and went to get a drink of water . 
he wondered about the things people see in the dark and where they came from . 
he was glad he couldn't see them in the moonlight . 
suddenly he realized he didn't see anything at all in the moonlight , there was nothing to see . 
he was in the middle of a desert . 
no wonder he was so thirsty . 
but luckily he had brought his purple crayon , and he knew where to find water on the desert . 
there was always a pool of it somewhere near a palm tree . 
Harold drank deeply . 
there's [: there is] nothing like drinking nice cool water on a desert . 
but there isn't much else to do on a desert +... 
Harold realized as he looked around , except maybe play in the sand . 
then he remembered how the xxx +//. 
then he remembered how the government has fun on the desert . 
it shoots off rockets . 
nineteen fifty six book . 
Harold decided to go to the moon . 
on a good fast rocket he figured he could get there and back in time for breakfast . 
he fired the rocket and off he went . 
xxx but the rocket missed the moon . 
it missed it by a mile ! 
and Harold went up and up +... 
but he was going up up up in the dark . 
where's he gonna land ? 
he tried to see where he was going by looking at the stars . 
he tried planets and comets , what he really needed to light his way was another moon . 
when Harold looked closely what he saw wasn't a moon , it was a flying saucer . 
Harold had heard about flying saucers , people saw them in the dark +... 
(a)n(d) nobody knew who was inside flying them . 
he decided he'd [: he had] better land his rocket right away . 
and landed it with a bump on the bottom of a strange planet . 
there was no danger falling off so big a planet +... 
however Harold thought he would feel a little bit more comfortable at the top of the planet . 
he wondered what planet he was on . 
in the dark light of the stars he looked for some sign that might tell him . 
xxx what planet is he on ? 
is he on Jupiter ? 
Harold had heard of men on Mars so he yelled a couple of hellos hopefully . 
he thought of the flying saucer out there and thought of the things that people see in the dark . 
he felt a great need for some company . 
he was sure any man on Mars would be cordial to a visitor like Harold who had come all this way to chat with him . 
he had to draw on his scanty knowledge of what a man on Mars looked like . 
but his looks wouldn't really matter in the dark so Harold didn't care much what he turned out to look like . 
all Harold wanted to know was there was some sort of friendly face close by . 
then all of a sudden Harold did see it clearly +... 
it was the face of a thing . 
it was a thing people see in the dark and it was sitting on a flying saucer . 
and Harold ran away . 
and he thought and stopped . 
probably the thing was about to fly to Earth and scare somebody maybe a little child . 
so bravely Harold crept back . 
he approached on tiptoe so the thing wouldn't hear him . 
and he reached out with his purple crayon +... 
and he put a completely damaging crack in the flying saucer . 
xxx . 
before the thing could grab him he was off again chuckling triumphantly . 
and ran as fast as he could in the dark . 
happily most of the way was downhill . 
he hoped he wouldn't fall head over heels . 
he arrived safely heels over head at the bottom of Mars where the rocket was . 
but by this time Harold had had enough of adventure , he wanted to get home in a dependable way . 
so he climbed down on the stars . 
it was sure but it was slow . 
and the points of the stars hurt Harold's feet . 
Harold wished he were home . 
and he recalled the best way to wish on a +//. 
instead of wishing it occurred to him at the last moment to jump aboard . 
he shot right down to +//. 
well he was visiting Mars but what planet do we live on ? 
he shot right down to Earth where he made a neat two point landing . 
he hadn't passed the moon on the way and he wondered what happened to it , it wasn't anywhere around . 
then he realized the night was just about gone and it was time for the sun to come up . 
he was very hungry . 
the sun appeared right on time . 
it came up big and bright +... 
and Harold remarked it was going to be a very nice day . 
nobody was even bothered by flying saucers and things in the sunshine . 
but for a startled moment he thought he saw a flying saucer . 
it was on the horizon looking as if it had just come in to land . 
he was mistaken though it wasn't a saucer it was an oatmeal bowl . 
xxx Harold happened to like hot breakfasts and he quickly drew up a chair . 
yummy he's going to eat his breakfast . 
xxx what did you have for breakfast ? 
you had meat ? 
I don't think so I think you had a granola bar right ? 
uhuh actually means no Honey . 
you want what ? 
ye:s ! 
yes ! 
no yes ? 
yes no ? 
xxx . 
yes ? 
you didn't ? 
did you make a funny face at me ? 
xxx this one ? 
but I'll read it anyway . 
the abridged version . 
Laney Lamb and Lily Bunny were best friends . 
everyday they met in the wildflower meadow just as the warm spring sun first sparkled on the morning dew . 
hooray squealed Lily she hopped even higher than before did a somersault and landed gracefully in the soft spring grass . 
awesome cried a strange deep voice . 
but it wasn't Laney's voice and it wasn't Lily's voice . 
there was a bright green frog . 
that was excellent he croaked . 
oh hello Fritz said Laney . 
hi said Fritz the frog I hope I'm not interrupting you . 
this is my friend Lily Bunny Laney said . 
oh nice to meet you Fritz croaked . 
but Lily just nodded at Fritz and looked away . 
she didn't like the thought of sharing the meadow and her friend with a stranger . 
Lily scowled she wanted Laney to pay attention to her . 
but Laney was so busy performing for Fritz she didn't hear . 
all that morning Laney played with Fritz while Lily stayed by herself at the far end of the me(adow) meadow . 
come on Lily , Laney bleated Fritz is picking watercress for us and it's [: it is] delicious . 
Lily stamped one of her big back feet and glared angrily at Laney . 
look she said you can play with that frog all you want but if you're going to be friends with him you can't be friends with me . 
why said Laney feeling very sad and confused . 
because said Laney that's [: that is] just the way it is . 
the next morning Lily didn't go to the wildflower meadow but went to have breakfast on the other side of the grassy hill . 
and there she met Penelope Pig . 
well here's [: here is] a surprise I thought you'd [: you would] be with Laney . 
you're best friends aren't you ? 
we were but now she wants to play with some frog . 
well maybe I can help said Penelope I know a lot about friends and friendship . 
the little what ? 
oh the little piggie . 
yeah there's the Penelope Pig . 
she is big . 
it's perfectly fine to have more than one good friend at a time . 
friendship is the perfect thing to share and having more friends mean having more fun . 
Penelope walked away leaving Lily alone . 
Penelope thinks she's so smart Lily thought but she doesn't understand . 
Lily started to eat but the plants were not as sweet as the ones by the pond . 
and she heard the laughter and shouting of two voices . 
she saw Laney and Fritz picking flowers together . 
they've got some nerve she said making all that racket . 
whatever they're [: they are] doing they're certainly having fun they don't need my help and that's fine with me . 
that afternoon Lily was sulking in the shade of a tree and Fritz hurried up and called Lily come quick Laney wants you right away . 
what does she want Lily asked coldly but Fritz had already hurried back over the hill . 
huh , it's probably nothing but I'll still go and see she said . 
when she got there she found Laney and Fritz proudly displaying a beautiful Lily sized necklace . 
how do you like it said Laney . 
is it for me she said . 
we made it just for you said Laney because you're my very best friend . 
and because I'd like to be your friend too Fritz said . 
oh what a beautiful necklace she said I've been so selfish . 
that's okay Laney said we didn't mean to leave you out I just got so excited about having a new friend that I forgot about our game . 
I was selfish too . 
well I'm sorry said Lily I hope it's not too late for us to have some fun together . 
so for the rest of the day the three friends romped and frolicked in the meadow . 
I'm glad to see Lily and Laney are friends again Penelope said . 
it was my advice that got them back together you know . 
early the next morning Lily Laney and Fritz met by the pond and all three had great fun together . 
this spring will be the best ever because now I even have more friends than before .
