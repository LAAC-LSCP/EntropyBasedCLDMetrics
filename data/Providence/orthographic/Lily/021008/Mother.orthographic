Mrs Bear and Sam bumped along just the two of them uphill and down up and down . 
at each sleepy house Mrs Bear stopped the truck .

and off he went making tracks in new snow . 
waving a red bag and waving to Mrs Bear . 
leaving one tasty cake at each sleepy door all by himself . 
that's right there were two cakes left in two red bags . 
for us whispered Sam . 
of course said Mrs Bear . 
the sun was just sunning up the little white house . 
hello house said Sam as they went inside kicking off their boots . 
Mrs Bear poured cocoa in cups and they wriggled their toes in fat socks enjoying their cakes with cocoa . 
and as their bellies filled up they took turns telling stories .
