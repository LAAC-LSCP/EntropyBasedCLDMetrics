mhm . 
our solar system is made up of a star , which we call the sun , and a group of planets that travel around it . 
there are also moons , asteroids , and comets . 
the sun is more than a million times larger than Earth . 
it is a huge ball of hydrogen and helium gases . 
xxx , here's Mercury .

Jupiter is a very different planet from the other planets near the sun .

xxx I love you .

xxx mm . 
every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon , a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light . 
this is Pride rock . 
home to my good friend , king +... 
who is that ? 
that's king Mufasa . 
on this particular morning , animals from all over the Pride lands had come to Pride rock to celebrate the birth of their newborn cub , Simba . 
as part of the celebration , I had a special duty . 
I cracked open a gourd , dipped my finger inside , and made a mark on Simba's forehead . 
then I lifted the future king up high for all to see . 
the elephants trumpeted with their trunks , the monkeys jumped up and down , and the zebras stamped their hoofs [: hooves] with happiness . 
what animals do you see ? 
xxx you're right , where are the monkeys ? 
here they are , and what else do you see ? 
and what else ? 
the elephants , and do you remember what this is ? 
what kind of animal is that ? 
think so . 
not far from the ceremony , in a cave at the back side of Pride rock , a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled , life's [: life is] not fair , I shall never be king . 
who's that ? 
moments later , Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave . 
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba , he said . 
Zazu , Mufasa's trusted advisor , also appeared . 
you should have been first in line . 
I was first in line until that little hair ball was born , he said , and Scar stalked out of the cave . 
he's a bird , right ? 
uhhuh . 
before long , Simba grew into a healthy , playful young cub . 
early one morning , he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
as they looked out at the rising sun , Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands . 
look Simba , he said , everything the light touches is our kingdom . 
Simba scanned the horizon and noticed a dark spot in the distance . 
what about that shadowy place ? 
that's beyond our borders , you must never go there Simba . 
but I thought a king can do whatever he wants . 
there's more to being king than getting your way all the time . 
everything you see exists together in a delicate balance . 
as king , you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures . 
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope . 
we're all connected in the great Circle of life . 
later , as Simba headed back down the path , he ran into Scar . 
hey uncle Scar , guess what , I'm gonna be king of Pride rock . 
my dad showed me the whole kingdom , and I'm gonna rule it all . 
Scar looked slyly at the young cub . 
he didn't show you what's beyond that rise of the northern border . 
well no , he said I couldn't go there . 
oh he's right , it's far too dangerous . 
only the bravest lions go there . 
hello ? 
&-er . 
when Simba returned home , he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi . 
come on , I just heard about this great place . 
the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go , as long as Zazu went with them . 
Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird . 
they led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him . 
once the cubs were free of Zazu , Simba pounced on Nala . 
then Nala flipped Simba onto his back . 
they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones . 
Simba looked around and gasped . 
this is it , we made it ! 
but before the cubs could explore any farther , Zazu tracked them down . 
we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands , and right now , we are all in very real danger . 
xxx , who's that . 
who are those ? 
do hyenas laugh a lot ? 
what 0are their names ? 
do you remember one name ? 
one of the hyena's names ? 
Joe ? 
okay , do you remember any of their names ? 
and the always laughing Ed . 
Banzai gra:bbed Zazu by the neck and plopped him down . 
xxx hyenas circled their prey , licking their chops . 
what's the hurry , we'd love you to stick around for dinner . 
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom , Simba , Nala , and Zazu quickly slipped away . 
but the hyenas weren't distracted for long . 
they gave chase , and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could . 
finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones . 
just when it looked as if it were all over for the young cubs , Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with one swipe of his big paw . 
if you ever come near my son again , he said . 
the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba . 
you deliberately disobeyed me , I'm very disappointed . 
Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son . 
Simba peered up at his father . 
I was just trying to be brave , like you . 
well their home is back in the Pride lands , but right now they're just looking , at the , ah , at the stars , right ? 
are they twinkly ? 
sparkly ? 
do you still have all three rings ? 
mhm . 
wow , nice . 
Dad , we're pals , right , and we'll always be together , right , said Simba . 
Mufasa looked up at the stars . 
Simba , let me tell you something my father told me . 
look at the stars . 
great kings of the past look down on us from these stars . 
so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you , and so will I . 
meanwhile , the hyenas received another visitor . 
an angry Scar showed up at their lair . 
I practically gift wrapped those cubs and you couldn't even dispose of them , he said . 
Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared . 
be prepared for what , Banzai laughed . 
for the death of the king , said Scar . 
the following day , Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge . 
when they arrived , Scar turned to his young nephew . 
now you wait here , your father has a marvelous surprise for you . 
well he has some hair on his head . 
ahhah ! 
Scar signaled the hyenas , who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba . 
they've just a tiny little tiny bit of hair . 
right . 
xxx goodness . 
from a distance , Mufasa noticed the rising dust . 
Scar appeared quickly at his side . 
stampede in the gorge , Simba's [: Simba is] down there ! 
I guess he'd hafta jump . 
Mufasa plunged into the gourd and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests . 
he found Simba , grabbed him the nape of his neck , and pulled him onto a nearby ledge . 
but suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede . 
desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him . 
help me Brother , he said . 
Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper in his ear , long live the king , and let go of Mufasa . 
Simba peered over the ridge just as his father disappeared beneath the thundering stampede . 
later , Scar found Simba hovering over his father , sobbing . 
it was an accident , I didn't mean for it to happen . 
what am I going to do ? 
run away Simba , said Scar , run away and never return . 
Simba to(ld) did as he was told , unaware that his uncle's hyena friends had been ordered to finish him off . 
Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne . 
meanwhile , Simba plodded across the Savanna without any food or water . 
it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot hot sun . 
as the vultures circled overhead , a big hearted wart+hog named Pumbaa stumbled upon the lion . 
he turned to his trusty pal , a fast talking meerkat named Timon . 
he's so cute and all alone , can we keep him ? 
Pumbaa are you nuts , lions eat guys like us . 
but Pumbaa scooped Simba him up anyway and carried him to safety . 
when Simba awoke , the first thing that sprang to his mind was his father . 
Timon taught him about hakuna@s:swa matata@s:swa which means no responsibilities and no worries . 
you've got to put your past behind you , he said , and that's exactly what Simba did . 
he stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion . 
but eventually he got homesick . 
and one night he looked at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him a long time ago . 
the next day , Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness . 
who is that ? 
who's that ? 
it's Nala . 
Nala what are you doing here ? 
why didn't you come back to Pride rock , you're the king , she said . 
I'm not the king , Scar is . 
Simba , he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands , there's no food or water , and if you don't come back soon , everyone will be in trouble , you're our only hope ! 
I can't go back . 
Simba yelled at the heavens , you said you'd always be there for me but you're not . 
because of me . 
Simba didn't believe he could challenge Scar to the throne , so he stayed in the jungle with Nala and his new friends . 
but I knew the time had come for Simba to take his place in the circle of life , and I headed for the jungle . 
when Simba saw me , he was surprised . 
who are you ? 
question is , I asked , who are you ? 
I thought I knew , but now I'm not so sure . 
well I know who you are , you're Mufasa's boy . 
I led Simba to a reflecting pool . 
when he looked in the water he saw a lion . 
that's not my father , it's just my reflection . 
look harder , he lives in you , I said . 
the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared . 
look inside yourself Simba , you are more than what you have become . 
you must take your place in the Circle of life . 
that's the ghost of his father , of king Mufasa . 
yeah , well , scary , but he's still nice . 
he looks a little scary but he's still very nice . 
yeah . 
when Simba arrived back at Pride rock , he found the land bare and dry . 
the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother . 
suddenly , a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock , and there stood Simba . 
Scar jumped back . 
Simba , I'm a little surprised to see you , alive . 
give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart , said Simba . 
Scar started to slink off but he turned and lunged one last time at Simba . 
Simba moved quickly and flipped Scar over the edge where a pack of hyenas were waiting hungrily . 
limping badly , Simba climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
he let out a magnificent roar as he looked over his kingdom . 
before long , Pride rock flourished again . 
Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had their own newborn cub . 
with their friends around , including Zazu , Pumbaa and Timon , a new celebration of life took place . 
after making a mark on the forehead of the young cub , I held him up for all the kingdom to see . 
oh let's read a different book Sweetie pie . 
a different one . 
did you drop one ? 
well , look at the ones you have , and figure out which one you dropped . 
well , which ones do you have in your hand ?

Sweetie , you know what , you can hold them until we go out , but once we go out , Mommy's [: Mommy is] gonna hafta hold them , okay ? 
what's this called ? 
Ariel , and who's that ? 
one morning , the little mermaid Ariel , went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend Flounder . 
Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father , king Triton , and the other mer+people . 
but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert . 
xxx , what's that ? 
while they searched , Flounder began to get nervous . 
what was that , he asked , did you hear something ? 
suddenly , a very large shark smashed through the side of the ship . 
swim , a shark , Flounder cried . 
they swam away very quickly . 
Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them . 
you big bully , Flounder shouted at the shark . 
xxx . 
as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark , Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave . 
even though he was a very small fish , Flounder had a very big +... 
and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea . 
after their adventure , Ariel and Flounder headed home , hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert . 
does she have a big feathery hat ? 
yeah , and what's Sebastian doing ? 
he's the conductor , right . 
that's an octopus , I think . 
do you remember how many legs an octopus has ?
