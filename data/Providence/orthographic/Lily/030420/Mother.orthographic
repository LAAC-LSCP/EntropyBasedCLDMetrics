oh that's a good idea . 
well but you know what remember last time mommy's glasses broke so I don't think I want donkey to climb on my glasses . 
well (be)cause we don't wanna buy yet another pair of glasses I think daddy would be unhappy if mommy bought yet another pair . 
I seem to go through glasses rather quickly . 
don't hurt me donkey . 
oh thanks donkey . 
yeah . 
sweets you wanna read a book ? 
book ? 
should we read a book ? 
wouldjou [: would you] like to pick one out ? 
alright . 
we could also play dominos too if you want . 
wow . 
you'd rather read Dot . 
well okay . 
hi there my name's Dot . 
actually I'm princess Dot next in line to be queen of the whole ant hill . 
of course my sister Ada's [: Ada is] actually queen now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time . 
don't get me wrong I like being a princess . 
but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troop then perform royal duties . 
and besides Ada's [: Ada is] a good queen even though she worries a lot . 
she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much . 
when she was a queen in training she used to get upset about everything . 
of course there used to be a lot to get upset over . 
you see our ant hill used to be in a ton of trouble . 
there were these big mean old grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year . 
we were all terrified of those grasshoppers . 
they barely left us enough food for ourselves for the winter . 
poor Ada . 
I hafta admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time . 
now my friend Flick he's a really cool guy . 
he's an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything . 
once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf . 
anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flick invented a harvesting machine . 
it was really neat but no one except me would listen to him and see what amazing things his machine could do . 
maybe if they had things would've been different . 
one day we heard the grasshoppers arriving so we all ran inside the ant hill Flick was left outside with his invention . 
I told you Flick was cool but I didn't tell you he could be kinda [: kind of] clumsy too . 
he ended up knocking the entire offering of grain over the ledge and into the river below . 
now we were in awfully big trouble . 
the grasshoppers got really mad and even picked me up and threatened to squish me . 
ah that's an ant's worst nightmare . 
ah . 
oh my gosh a nightmare . 
don't squish me . 
don't squish her . 
Flick felt so bad he came up with a plan to make things better . 
what's donkey doing ? 
really ? 
really ? 
oh it looked like he was nibbling on your toe . 
you're right . 
xxx . 
xxx . 
now he has a necklace on . 
wow . 
oh it looks like a stethoscope . 
well +... 
okay . 
he decided to leave our island to go in search of warrior bugs to protect us . 
no ant had ever left ant island before . 
good luck Flick I shouted as he flew away on a dandelion puff . 
nobody believed he could do it nobody expect me that is . 
you just watch I said . 
he'll get the bestest roughest bugs you've ever seen . 
and guess what ? 
he did . 
well sort of . 
the only problem was that the warrior bugs Flick brought back were actually circus bugs . 
it was a tiny mistake but it could still work out . 
at least I thought it could . 
Flick got the circus bugs and me and my whole blueberry troop to help him with his plan . 
we made a giant fake bird out of leaves and twigs . 
so when the grasshoppers return to get their food we would scare them by crawling inside the bird and flying it right at them . 
it was a daring plan and Flick was great . 
he was like the captain of our ship . 
blueberries ready he asked when we were loaded inside the bird . 
ready we shouted back . 
then whoosh we were flying . 
and we really scared those mean old grasshoppers . 
they thought we were go they were going to get eaten by our bird . 
but then we kinduv [: kind of] crashed . 
none of us got hurt but the grasshoppers figured out what was going on . 
and they realized we weren't a real bird after all . 
but Flick was really brave he had stood up to the grasshoppers and gotten the whole colony to follow him . 
and Ada helped him too together they fought off the biggest meanest grasshopper of them all . 
in the end those mean old grasshoppers were scared away for good especially after a real live bird chased them down . 
in the end the only sad part was that the circus bugs had to leave . 
P_T_Flea owner of the circus asked Flick to join them too . 
sure you can't tour with us he asked ? 
but Flick just said sorry my place is here . 
anyway the circus bugs all promised to come back and visit us at our little ant hill . 
and I sure hope they do . 
in the meantime I think Ada has a crush on Flick . 
I mean it's always been totally obvious that he had a crush on her but this is the first time I've seen her let him hold her hand and stuff . 
anyway I've gotta go now I wanna practice my flying before supper . 
see ya [: you] later .
