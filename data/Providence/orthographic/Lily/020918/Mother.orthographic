Franklin +... 
Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run . 
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swing . 
but Franklin had a problem he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels . 
in the Spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes . 
Beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first . 
she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off . 
look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself . 
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles . 
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other . 
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels . 
we're going on a picnic said Bear come on . 
Franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone . 
&aw that's [: that is] kinda [: kind of] sad isn't it ? 
what's xxx wearing ? 
that's [: that is] so that if they fall down they don't hurt their heads right ? 
just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right ? 
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike . 
he wanted to ride all by himself . 
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push . 
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered . 
and he fell into the +... 
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again . 
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out . 
he watched as his friends rode off without him . 
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes . 
what are they on here ? 
that's Rabbit's bike . 
that &-uh is Bear's bike . 
xxx &-uh oh oh my gosh Honey you're absolutely right ! 
you're right ! 
you know what the purple one must be Fox's . 
I didn't even realize . 
right . 
you're right and the blue one's [: one is] Bear's (be)cause Bear is big right ? 
right . 
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house . 
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother . 
I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin . 
did you give it your best effort asked his mother . 
well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time . 
xxx Franklin sat on his bike . 
it's tippy he cried . 
his mother held on to the seat try it I won't let you go until you tell me to . 
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind . 
he felt very unsteady and very unsure . 
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling . 
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating . 
it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends . 
do you think everything comes easily for them she asked . 
Franklin had to think about that . 
Franklin went to the park he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars . 
each time she got to the third rung she fell into the sand below . 
no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy . 
easy for you said Beaver she tried one more time and fell again . 
maybe tomorrow Beaver grumbled . 
did you go on the monkey bars at school yesterday ? 
what did we do we went this one then the next one then the next one then the next one then we xxx +... 
xxx ! 
then you fell . 
but I caught you right you didn't really fall . 
Franklin remembered when Beav(er) when Badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater . 
it's easy said Franklin just do it . 
Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water . 
I think she's swimming underwater . 
are you gonna swim underwater one day ? 
Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball . 
he couldn't hit the ball at all . 
but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run . 
xxx he's playing baseball . 
like Daddy's team right . 
well Rabbit's [: Rabbit is] just hoping that Fox can hit the ball . 
xxx he wants Fox to do well right ? 
and he's waiting to catch the ball he's got his mitt on . 
and if Fox hits the ball Rabbit is gonna get ready to catch it . 
that would be great . 
just then Porcupine came by she moved very slowly . 
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows . 
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe . 
that's it cried Franklin and he hurried home . 
Franklin put on +... 
he lined the walk with old pillows . 
I'm ready to try again he told his mother and now I won't worry if I fall . 
Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat . 
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up . 
then it happened Franklin told his mother to let go . 
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash . 
way to go cheered his mother . 
Franklin was thrilled . 
finally he was riding his bike all by himself . 
I can do it he shouted . 
Franklin rode to the park to show his friends . 
look at me he called . 
Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over I think I'll work on that he laughed . 
not everything is as easy as it looks .

Toad thought and thought . 
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog . 
I will go out on the front porch and walk up and down said Toad . 
perhaps that will help me to think of a story . 
Toad walked up and down on the porch for a long time . 
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog . 
then Toad went into the house and stood on his head . 
why are you standing on your head asked Frog . 
I hope that if I stand on my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad . 
Toad stood on his head for a long time . 
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog . 
then Toad poured a glass of water over his head . 
why are you pouring water over your head asked Frog . 
I hope that if I pour water over my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad . 
Toad poured many glasses of water over his head but he still could not think of a story . 
well chewing lollies is not good for your teeth . 
xxx well you definitely can't chew without teeth but you have teeth but it's better to lick it instead of chew it .

then Toad began to bang his head against the wall . 
why are you banging your head against the wall asked Frog . 
I hope that if I bang my head against the wall hard enough it will help me think of a story . 
he has a headache . 
(be)cause he banged his head against the wall oh no . 
I'm feeling much better now Toad said Frog I don't think I need a story anymore . 
oh then you get out of bed and let me get in said Toad because I feel terrible .

but the toad couldn't think of a story . 
he walked up and down but he couldn't think of one . 
he stood on his head but he couldn't think of one . 
he poured water over his head but he still couldn't think of one and he banged his head against the wall but still could not think of a story . 
then the toad did not feel so well and the frog was feeling better . 
so the toad went to bed and the frog got up and told him a story .

but Toad didn't answer he had fallen +...

a sparrow flew down excuse me said the sparrow did you lose a button because I found one . 
well that's not my button said Toad that button has two holes and mine had four holes . 
Toad put the button in his pocket . 
they went back to the woods and looked on the dark path . 
here's your button said Frog . 
oh that's not my button cried Toad that button is small and my button was big .

but he xxx put the square button in his pocket . 
the button yes I think it has holes . 
I think it has four holes but it's square instead of round . 
Frog and Toad went back to the river and looked for the button in the mud . 
here's your button said Frog . 
oh that's not my button shouted Toad that button is thin and my button was thick . 
Toad put the thin button in his pocket . 
he was very angry . 
he jumped up and down and screamed . 
our whole world is covered with buttons and not one of them is mine . 
Toad ran home and slammed the door . 
there on the floor he saw his white four holed big round thick button . 
oh said Toad it was here all the time . 
what a lot of trouble I have made for Frog . 
Toad took all the buttons out of his pocket and took his sewing box down from the shelf . 
then he sewed the buttons all over his jacket . 
the next day Toad gave his jacket to Frog . 
Frog thought it was beautiful . 
he put it on and jumped for joy .

Frog closed his eyes when Toad came out from behind the rocks . 
Frog and Toad jumped in the water and swam all afternoon . 
Frog swam fast and made big splashes . 
Toad swam slowly and made smaller splashes . 
a turtle came along the riverbank . 
Frog tell that turtle to go away said Toad I don't want him to see me in my bathing suit . 
Frog swam over to the turtle .

oh please go away cried Frog . 
but no one went away . 
Toad was getting colder and colder .
