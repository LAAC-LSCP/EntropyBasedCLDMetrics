Debbie , who you just met is Gabi's mom . 
so tiny ! 
do you remember what Alec's baby's brother's name is ? 
Ma:x , that's right . 
my two closest friends here both had babies two days apart . 
two baby boys . 
back to Nordstrom's . 
I was so shocked I couldn't believe it . 
yes , what should we read ? 
yeah . 
I had never seen the movie I didn't realize it was kind of a downer . 
every morning as the sun peeks over the horizon , a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light . 
this is Pride rock . 
home my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi . 
to , to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba . 
one of the doctors that my grandmother had actually (.) it's like (.) no one could remember his name , he's from India , and we kept calling him doctor Mufasa . 
as part of the celebration , I had a special duty , I cracked open a gourd , dipped my finger inside , and made a mark on Simba's forehead . 
and I lifted the future king up high for all to see . 
not far from the ceremony in a cave at the backside of Pride rock , a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled , life's [: life is] not fair , I shall never be king . 
this was Mufasa's brother Scar , who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king . 
moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave . 
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba , you should have been first in line . 
I was first in line until the little hair ball born , and with that Scar stalked out of the cave . 
before long , Simba grew into a healthy , playful young cub . 
early one morning , he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock . 
as they looked out at the rising sun , Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands . 
look Simba , everything the light touches is our kingdom . 
what about that shadowy place , said Simba . 
that's beyond our borders , you must never go there , Simba . 
later as Simba headed back to the path , he ran into Scar . 
hey uncle Scar , guess what , I'm going to be king of Pride rock , my dad showed me the whole kingdom . 
he didn't show you what's beyond the rise at the northern borders , said Scar . 
well no , he said I can't go there . 
oh he's right , only the bravest lions go there , said Scar . 
when Simba returned home , he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi . 
come on , said Simba , I just heard about this great place . 
Simba pounced on Nala and Nala flipped Simba on his back . 
they tumbled down the hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones . 
of the Pride lands , said Nala . 
and we're in danger . 
suddenly , three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull . 
a trio of trespassers , said the hyenas . 
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom , (.) Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw . 
I'm very disappointed in you Simba , you deliberately disobeyed me , he said . 
I was just trying to be brave like you . 
being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble , said Mufasa . 
Dad , we're pals right , we'll always be together , won't we ? 
Simba , said Mufasa , let me tell you something my father told me . 
look at the stars , the great kings of the past look down on us from the stars . 
so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you , and so will I . 
meanwhile , Scar went to visit the hyenas . 
I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you and you couldn't even dispose of them . 
Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared for the death of the king . 
the following day , Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge . 
when they arrived , Scar turned to his young nephew . 
Scar signaled the hyenas , who chased a herd of wildebeests directly towards Simba . 
wildebeests . 
didn't we read that they were going to get a wildebeest in the: (.) zoo , in our zoo ? 
right ? 
that's exciting . 
Mufasa took off to save his young son . 
but he plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests . 
he found Simba , grabbed him by the nape of his neck and pulled him to a nearby ledge . 
suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede . 
climb another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him . 
help me Brother , he said . 
but Scar let go of Mufasa and he fell down . 
it was an accident , said Scar , I didn't mean for it to happen . 
what am I going to do , said Simba . 
run away Simba , said Scar , run away and never return . 
Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne . 
meanwhile , Simba plodded across the savanna without any food or water . 
and it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot sun . 
a big hearted wart+hog named Pumbaa stumbled upon the young lion and he turned to his trusty pal , a meerkat named Timon . 
he's so cute , can't we keep him ? 
are you nuts Pumbaa , lions eat guys like us , said Teemon , Timon . 
you want some what ? 
you want another sandwich ? 
wo:w , I'm impressed Honey . 
do you want another (.) hummus sandwich ? 
or do you want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ? 
what kind of sandwich would you like , Honey ? 
you could also have a turkey sandwich or a ham sandwich ? 
uhhuh ? 
what do you want ? 
hummus ? 
maybe you wanna read the rest of the Lion king book to yourself Honey . 
really ? 
you want some water ? 
how do you ask nicely ? 
o:kay . 
yes I can , let me just (.) cut your sandwich first . 
okay . 
okay . 
there you go . 
&-uh . 
here's some water in your little baby cup , yeah let me just get the phone xxx . 
hello ? 
hello: ! 
I'm good , how's [: how is] the birthday boy ? 
goo:d . 
it occurred to me after I left a message that he wasn't there . 
xxx . 
&-um , Lily has her Brown thing now actually , can I call you back in just a little bit ? 
okay . 
o:kay . 
Mommy's [: Mommy is] eating edges of your hummus sandwich .

I love it . 
I wanna eat it a:ll up . 
you're welcome baby ! 
xxx . 
xxx , you're welcome , Sweetie ! 
could I have a kiss ? 
I love you ! 
I know , that's the neatest backpack I've ever seen ! 
mhm . 
Simba stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion . 
but eventually he got homesick . 
and one night he looked up at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him long ago . 
the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars , so whenever you feel alone , just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I . 
the next day , Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness . 
Simba came to his rescue but after wrestling with the lioness who easily flipped him on his back , he realized she was his old friend Nala . 
why didn't you come back to Pride rock , she asked , you are the king . 
I'm not the king , Scar is . 
Simba , he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands , there's no food or , and no water . 
and if you don't do something soon , everyone will starve . 
you're our only hope . 
Simba went to the reflecting pool and when he looked in the water , he saw a lion . 
the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared . 
look inside yourself Simba , you are more than what you have become . 
you must take your place in the circle of life . 
encouraged by his father's words , Simba returned to Pride rock . 
when he arrived , he found the land bare and dry . 
the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother . 
I'm the king , said Scar , if you were half the king Mufasa was , I'm ten times the king Mufasa was . 
suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba . 
I'm a little surprised to see you alive , Simba . 
give me one good reason I shouldn't rip you apart , Scar . 
but Scar forced Simba to say in front of all the lions that he had caused his father's death . 
oh Simba , you're in trouble again but this time daddy isn't here to save you and everyone knows why . 
Simba , knowing the truth , leapt [: leaped] on Scar . 
Nala and the other lionesses joined the battle . 
Scar tried to escape . 
and Simba ran after him , Scar pleaded with his nephew . 
run away Scar , said Simba , and never return . 
limping badly , Simba climbed to the top of pride rock and let out a magnificent roar as he looked out over his kingdom . 
before long Pride rock flourished again , Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had they had their own newborn cub . 
and I held him up for all the kingdom to see .

how's [: how is] your water in your little baby cup ?

summer brings so many things , summer brings us rides on swings .

we like this way to spend a day , we make a sand house on the shore , we make some windows and a door . 
and waves come up , they come up fast , sometimes our sand house does not last . 
but there is lots_of sand to dig , to make another just as big . 
when we go out on summer nights , we see the fireflies with their lights . 
we catch them , they will give us light , to find our way back home at night . 
we ask a farmer , will you stop and let us ride back home on top ? 
we let the fireflies go away , the moon is out , it lights our way . 
we hear the horse go clop clop clop , our pup goes fast asleep on top . 
we stay awake and think of things , the happy things that summer brings .

xxx , Horton hatches the egg ? 
this is a long one , do you wanna read a shorter one ? 
this one ? 
you gonna help me read ? 
sighed Maisy a lazy bird hatching an egg , I'm tired and I'm bored and I've kinks in my +... 
from sitting , just sitting here day after day , it's work , how I hate it , I'd much rather +... 
right . 
I'd take a vacation , fly off for a rest , if I could find someone to stay on my +... 
if I could find someone , I'd fly away free . 
then Horton the elephant passed by her +... 
right . 
hello , called the lazy bird , smiling her best , you've nothing to do , and I do need a rest . 
would you like to sit on the egg in my nest ? 
the elephant laughed , why of all silly things , I haven't feathers and I haven't wings . 
me on your egg , why that doesn't make sense , your egg is so small mam , and I am so +... 
immense ! 
tut tut , answered Maisy , I know you're not small , but I'm sure you can do it , no trouble +... 
just sit on it softly , you're gentle and kind , come be a good fellow , I know you +... 
I can't , said the elephant , please , begged the bird . 
I won't be gone long sir , I give you +... 
I'll hurry right back , why I'll never be missed . 
very well , said the elephant , since you +... 
you want a vacation , go fly off and take it , I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to +... 
I'll stay and be faithful , I mean what I say , toodleloo sang out Maisy and fluttered +... 
hm: , the first thing to do , murmured Horton , let's see . 
the first thing to do is to prop up this +... 
and make it much stronger , that has to be done . 
before I get on it , I must weigh +... 
then carefully , tenderly , gently he crept . 
up the trunk to the next where the little egg +... 
slept . 
then Horton the elephant smiled , now that's that , and he sat and he sat +/. 
he's sitting on it , he's keeping it warm . 
and he sat all that day , and he kept the egg warm , and he sat all that night , through a +... 
it poured and it lightning , it thundered and rumbled , this isn't much fun , the poor elephant +... 
I wish she'd come back (be)cause I'm cold and I'm wet , I hope that that Maisy bird doesn't +... 
but Maisy by this time was far beyond reach , enjoying the sunshine way off in +... 
and having such fun , such a wonderful rest , decided she'd never +... 
great ! 
let me grab the phone , ringing . 
sure Sweetie . 
yes , let me get it for you . 
let me get you some cold water . 
xxx . 
(o)kay sweets . 
so Horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn , the leaves +... 
and then came the winter , the snow and sleet and icicles hung from +... 
his trunk and his feet , but Horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze , I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it +... 
I meant what I said and I said what I meant , an elephant's [: elephant is] faithful +... 
so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through and then came the spring time with troubles +... 
his friends gathered round and they shouted with glee , look Horton the elephant's [: elephant is] up in a +... 
they taunted and teased him , they yelled , how absurd , old Horton the elephant thinks he's a +... 
they laughed and they laughed and they all ran away , and Horton was lonely , he wanted to +... 
there's your water . 
I meant what I said and I said what I meant , and elephant's [: elephant is] faithful +... 
no matter what happens , this egg must be tended . 
but poor Horton's troubles were far far from +... 
so , for while Horton sat there so faithful so kind , three hunters came sneaking up softly +... 
behind . 
he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start , three rifles were aiming right straight at his +... 
oh no . 
did he run , he did not . 
Horton stayed on that nest , he held his head high and threw out his +... 
he looked at the hunters as much as to say , shoot if you must but I won't +... 
I meant what I said and I said what I meant , an elephant's [: elephant is] faithful +... 
but the men didn't shoot , much to Horton's surprise , they dropped their three guns and they stared with +... 
look , they all shouted , can such a thing be , an elephant sitting on top of a +... 
it's strange , it's amazing , it's wonderful , new , don't shoot him , we'll catch him that's just +... 
and it's just what we'll do . 
we'll take him alive , why he's terribly funny , we'll sell him back home to a circus for +... 
oh my gosh . 
and the first thing he knew , they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on , they dug up his tree and put him inside , with Horton so sad , he practically +... 
up out of the jungle , up into the sky , up over the mountains ten thousand feet +... 
and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant egg nest and +... 
and out of the wagon and onto a ship , out over the ocean and o:h . 
what a trip . 
rolling and tossing and splashed with the spray , and Horton sat day after day after day . 
I am reading .
