what ? 
these are the c_ds of when Jenny takes movies of us when she's here and then she brings us the little movies to play on the computer . 
or it was a little book with different colors and pink was pink . 
and purple was purple . 
and flower flower flower . 
I was talking about when you were talking when you were just learning to talk when you were a baby . 
and the funny thing is she's gone through things where she'll become really obsessed with some field of study and at that point she must have been two or just like two and a quarter or something like that +... 
that's a good thing actually maybe we'll look at your map in a while (be)cause now like I xxx any recollection xxx . 
yeah should we look at your map and see how many states you know now ? 
you used to know like half the states when you were two . 
we probably don't even know that many now right ?

xxx ! 
where's your little oh Debbie was here Honey and I had to give her something then I forgot . 
oh well oh well . 
oh here's your map . 
here's your little map . 
and the other funny thing about Lily when she was doing all her states is she would only look at the &-um map of the United States upside down . 
we would give it to her right side up and she would say no it's upside down and she would turn it over . 
you are silly should we look at our states ?

&-uh Matthew lives here .

Washington state . 
Honey do you think the words are written here or do you think Mommy's [: Mommy is] just super smart and knows all her states ?

you know Mommy and Daddy went to Idaho once they went hot air ballooning . 
you know didn't Elmo go in a hot air balloon when you get in a little basket and it goes up up up up up . 
xxx I think you should try that you want me to show you pictures of it I have pictures of it when we went . 
it was very fun Mommy thought it was more fun than Daddy . 
you know it was really (be)cause I'm not like I never go on rollercoaster rides or anything like that .

xxx Daddy was saying we should take you to this place one day . 
they have all this bubbling mud that they call the paint pots and it just sits in the ground and bubbles really it's hot . 
and it makes noises and it's smelly . 
the sulfur is smelly .

and look and so acidic it burned a hole right through the street . 
see ? 
and look a buffalo ! 
yeah . 
&-um (be)cause it's too hot . 
look there's the basket for the hot air balloon see ? 
and I think &-um like when we went to Yellowstone they said someone actually some kid wandered off into Old Faithful or something and it set off . 
see look here's the hot air balloon and they're gonna blow it up . 
there's the fire . 
and that's what it looks like when we were inside the basket . 
and they blew up two big balloons . 
and then this is us from the sky we were in the basket and that was the other balloon down below . 
so Idaho not so exciting .
