Mister Slinger was sharp as a tack . 
he wore artistic shirts . 
glasses on a chain around his neck . 
and he wore a different colored tie for each day of the week . 
green . 
green tie . 
green . 
instead of greetings students or good morning pupils , Mister Slinger winked and said howdy . 
he thought desks in rows were old fashioned and boring . 
do you rodents thinks you , think you can handle a semicircle ? 
and he was always providing them with tasty snacks . 
things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy . 
I wanna be a teacher when I grow up , said Lilly . 
me too said her friends Chester and Wilson and Victor . 
at home , Lily pretended to be Mister Slinger . 
I am the teacher , she told her baby brother Julius , listen up . 
Lilly even wanted her own set of deluxe picture encyclopedias . 
whenever the students had free time they were permitted to go to the light bulb lab in the back of the classroom . 
they expressed their ideas creatively through drawing and writing . 
Lilly went often . 
she had a lot of ideas . 
she drew pictures of Mister Slinger and wrote stories about him too . 
during sharing time , Lilly showed her creations to the entire class . 
wow said Mister Slinger . 
when Mister Slinger had bus duty , Lilly stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus . 
Lilly raised her hand more than anyone in the class , even if she didn't know the answer . 
and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers . 
I wanna be a teacher when I grow up , said Lilly . 
excellent choice said Mister Slinger . 
one Monday morning Lilly came to school especially happy . 
she had gone shopping with her Grammy [: Grandmother] over the weekend . 
she had a new pair of movie star sunglasses . 
complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mister Slinger's . 
she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened . 
Lily wanted to show everyone . 
not now said Mister Slinger , listen to our story . 
Lilly had a hard time listening . 
she really wanted to show everyone . 
what's Mister Slinger doing ? 
he has a book , what's he doing with the book ? 
really ? 
Lilly really really wanted to show everyone . 
not now said Mister Slinger . 
but Lilly couldn't wait . 
the glasses were so glittery , the quarters were so shiny , and the purse played such nice music , not to mention how excellent it was for xxx , storing school supplies . 
look she whispered , look everyone , look what I've got . 
everyone looked , including Mister Slinger . 
and he was not amused . 
I'll just keep your things at my desk until the end of the day he said , and then you can take them home . 
Lilly's stomach lurched , she felt like crying . 
that afternoon she went to the light bulb lab , she was still very sad . 
she thought and thought and thought , and then she became angry . 
she thought and thought and thought some more , and then she became furious , and drew a picture of Mister Slinger . 
it was not a very nice picture . 
a bag , yeah . 
you've got a bag too and they're both purple . 
oh . 
wow , that's great . 
oh , Lilly was very sad and ran all the way home . 
she found a nice note from Mister Slinger and some snacks in her bag and she felt very guilty . 
so her mother wrote a note and her father made some delicious snacks . 
the next morning Lilly got to school early . 
really really really really really really really sorry . 
no , she was just plain sorry . 
oh no . 
wow , he said . 
some stars and some swirls too . 
you know what honey , Mommy's ve:ry tired because someone got up at four in the morning . 
then she did a little performance using her bag and glasses and props . 
Mister Slinger joined in . 
she looked at them often but did not disturb a soul . 
she ran and skipped and hopped and flew all the way home . 
she has a bag and she's in the bathtub , that's kind of silly .
