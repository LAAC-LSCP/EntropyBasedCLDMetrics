Paddington's lucky day . 
you know Paddington lives in England . 
one day , not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor Gardens , Missus Brown thought she would take him out shopping . 
we're going to Portabello Road exclaimed Judy . 
you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan . 
there's a lot to see . 
Paddington didn't need asking twice , and soon afterward they all set off . 
suddenly they turned a corner and found himself in what seemed like a different world . 
a world of outdoor stands and push carts , gold and silver ornaments , books , old furniture , fruit and vegetables , people . 
his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in . 
sweetie pie , you know what ? 
you know where we keep your books in your room ? 
there's a picture on there , and Daddy and I bought that picture on Portabello road . 
one store was even having its picture taken . 
do we like the supermarket ? 
Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the xxx , through the glass . 
Missus Brown hesitated . 
she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon . 
but Jonathan told her not to worry . 
what goes in must come out . 
we can meet him back by the check+out counter on our way back added Judy . 
that's the manager . 
what's he wearing around his neck ? 
and what's that man wearing on his face ? 
what's he wearing on his +//. 
everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans . 
there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade . 
marmalade's [: marmalade is] like jam . 
do you like jam ? 
there it is , you're right . 
he could certainly see why it was called a super market . 
his paws were soon full , and he was just beginning to wish he's left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming towards him pushing a large basket on wheels . 
may I suggest you use one of these sir , he called . 
you can take as much as you want now , he continued . 
can I really , exclaimed Paddington . 
the manager nodded . 
yes , we like to make our customers happy . 
Paddington looked most impressed . 
in that case he said , I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure . 
the more Paddington saw of the super market the more he liked it . 
and he was sure Missus Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries . 
uhoh . 
Paddington thinks he can take them for free . 
the other customers looked on in amazement . 
perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by . 
but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddington with interest . 
since he had been in the sore , the manager had been joined by several other important looking men . 
and as Paddington reached the check out counter , one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap . 
achoo , did someone sneeze ? 
your sneeze fell ? 
well done said the lady handing him a ticket . 
there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here . 
Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw . 
over a hundred and fifty dollars worth , he gasped . 
but I've only got a nickel . 
looking up , Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him . 
watch out , cried the lady as he made a grab for the groceries . 
with a roar like an express train , everything began to tumble down off the counter . 
oh no it's falling on Paddington . 
where's Paddington ? 
he was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on . 
all in all , he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being . 
what's that ? 
that's right . 
a prize , echoed the Browns . 
and the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall . 
perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply of groceries . 
xxx , all of which , said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries , only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet . 
even in super markets . 
Paddington sniffed the air happily . 
which book is that ? 
he's got some floats on his arms . 
today , said Mister Brown at breakfast one bright summer morning , feels like the kind of day for taking a young bear to the seaside . 
hands up all those who agree . 
Jonathan , Judy , and Missus Brown all put up their hands . 
there's a tent at the seaside , there is , we're gonna get to that , you're right . 
everyone was very excited , and by the time they set out , the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move . 
Paddington carefully fastened his seat+belt . 
do you think he sits in a special car+seat like yours ? 
he's looking out the window , you're right . 
Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear . 
I'm afraid not , he said gloomily , we've only just left Windsor gardens and it's a very long way to the sea . 
Mister Brown was right , it was a long journey . 
but when they reached the seaside , the sight of the land and water soon made up for it . 
Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car . 
even the air had a different smell . 
what are those ? 
what are those ? 
remember what type of special bird they are , near the ocean ? 
are they seagulls ? 
Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things . 
and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed . 
come on Paddington , called Judy , let's go for a swim . 
it took Paddington quite a while to get ready . 
no wonder , cried Judy , you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw bands . 
fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water , exclaimed Jonathan . 
I thought the water might be cold , said Paddington . 
after his paw bands had been properly blown up , Paddington went in the water again . 
and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed . 
Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him . 
first there was a loud cry . 
then there were the sound of people booing . 
they're watching Mister Briggs' Punch and Judy , explained Missus Brown . 
jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears . 
where's Paddington asked Jonathan when he and Judy arrived back shortly afterwards carrying ice cream cones and an ice stick . 
I hope he's not long said Judy , I brought him a special cone . 
he'll be most upset if it melts . 
xxx , Jonathan glanced up and down the beach , crikey he said , look over there . 
the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze . 
something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent . 
there was a large bulge on one side , and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive . 
suddenly the tent began moving across the sand , scattering people in all directions . 
it just missed a large sand castle , went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea . 
quick shouted Judy , let's cut it off . 
but it was too late . 
Paddington , cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view . 
what on earth are you doing ? 
Paddington stared at her in amazement . 
Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs . 
I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy , I said it was his Punch and Judy . 
it's a puppet theater said Judy . 
they often have them at the seaside . 
there's one puppet called Mister Punch , and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo . 
if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington , it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs . 
but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up . 
it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time , and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show . 
you can have a seat in the front row , he said to Paddington . 
I expect bears do very good boos . 
one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside . 
but all good things come to an end , and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar . 
I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home , he said . 
I think I shall sleep so well on the way back , I may lose all of today's air with my snores . 
things like that which like in some of +//. 
oh my gosh . 
don't you feel well Sam ? 
it was a cold cold night on plum street . 
in the little white house , Missus Bear was putting Sam to bed . 
she closed their favorite book and they both blew out the candle . 
xxx , kiss good_night Sam , Missus Bear said , and she wrapped him all cozy in the blanket that was red . 
but suddenly , she heard a cough . 
what does a cough sound like ? 
Missus Bear put her arms around Sam . 
Sam shook his head , xxx xxx . 
poor Saam . 
open wide Sam , she said . 
yes , said his Mama , you need to be brave . 
Sam put the blanket on his head . 
I don't have a cough , xxx xxx . 
try again Sam , said his Mama . 
he opened up , then closed his mouth tight . 
too big , said Sam , xxx xxx . 
you can do it , Missus Bear said . 
too much syrup on a too big spoon . 
too much , said Sam , xxx xxx . 
Missus Bear rubbed frost off the window and peeked outside . 
snow ! 
Sam opened wide , then very wide . 
Missus Bear and Sam held hands on the stairs . 
Sam wore his robe that was blue and his slippers were too . 
and Missus Bear put extra +... 
after tea , they sat in the big purple chair by the window and waited for snow . 
Missus Bear told a story about a bear called Sam . 
Sam liked the story so much she told it again . 
xxx xxx went the cough , every now and then . 
Sam leaned back on his Mama's soft belly which wriggled when she talked . 
and all through the night Missus Bear and Sam sat in the big purple chair and waited . 
xxx , and finally it snowed . 
but they were fast asleep . 
and what did they do the next day ? 
what's that ? 
0a fox kind of looks like a wolf . 
but I think it's a fox .
