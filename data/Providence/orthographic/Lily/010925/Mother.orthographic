sweetie do you wanna read a book ? 
oh here , Mommy found it . 
(o)kay . 
and we'll read Paddington , xxx . 
do you know what this says ? 
this book belongs to Mommy . 
one day , Mister and Missus Brown were standing in Paddington station . 
they were waiting for their daughter Judy , who was coming home from school . 
Suddenly Mister Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail bags . 
look over there , he said to Missus Brown , I'm sure I saw a bear . 
a bear , said Missus Brown , in Paddington station . 
don't be silly Henry , there can't be . 
but there was . 
oh , as they drew near the bear stood up and politely raised its hat . 
good afternoon , it said in a small , clear voice , can I help you ? 
we were wondering if we could help you , said Missus Brown , wherever have you come from ? 
the bear looked (a)round carefully before replying . 
darkest Peru , I stowed away and I lived on marmalade . 
Missus bear spotted a label around the bear's neck , it said please look after this bear , thank you , Aunt Lucy . 
Missus Brown went off to look for Judy and Mister Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat . 
he left Paddington sitting at a corner table near the window . 
he soon returned , carrying two steaming cups of +... 
and a large plate piled hi:gh with sticky cakes . 
after his long journey Paddington was so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first , eat or drink . 
I think I'll try both at the same time , if you don't mind Mister Brown he announced . 
and without waiting for a reply he climbed on the table . 
Mister Brown stared out of the window pretending that he had tea with a bear at Paddington station every day of his life . 
when Missus Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw up her hands in horror . 
Henry , she said , what are you doing to that poor bear , he's covered with cream and jam . 
at the sound of Missus bear's voice Paddington jumped so much he stepped on a patch of strawberry jam and fell over backwards into his saucer of tea . 
I think we'd better go before anything else happens said Mister Brown , and he quickly led the way out of the cafeteria . 
Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it . 
come along , she said , we'll take you home in a taxi . 
then you can have a nice hot bath , and meet my brother Jonathan . 
Paddington had never been in a taxi before , he found it ve:ry exciting . 
and he stood on a little tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people in the street . 
soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door . 
he has a picture of Aunt Lucy . 
hm: . 
next she showed Paddington the bathroom . 
then he tried to write his name on the steamy glass with his paw . 
uhoh . 
uhoh . 
he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw he jumped in . 
the water was hot and soapy and very deep and to his horror he couldn't get out . 
he couldn't even turn the taps off . 
Paddington tried calling out help , at first in a quiet voice so as not to disturb anyone , but then much louder , help help ! 
but still nobody came . 
then he had an idea . 
downstairs , Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington . 
when suddenly she felt a plop . 
looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling . 
Paddington , she cried , he must be in trouble , quick ! 
Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor . 
what a mess , said Jonathan , we'd better wipe it up pretty quickly . 
oh Paddington , said Judy , what good luck we found you in time , you might have drowned . 
Paddington sat up , what good like I had (.) my had he said . 
some time later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs . 
settling himself down in a small armchair by the fire , he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes . 
it was nice being a bear , especially a bear called Paddington . 
he had a feeling life with the Browns was going to be fun . 
that's right , Paddington's [: Paddington is] lying on the chair with the pillows , he's relaxing . 
ooh he's ve:ry comfortable .
