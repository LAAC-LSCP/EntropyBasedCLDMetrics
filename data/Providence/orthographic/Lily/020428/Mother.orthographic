since winter was not far off , the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw .

the winter days came and when the first snow fell the five little field mice took to their hideout in the stones . 
in the beginning there was lots to eat , and the mice told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats . 
yeah . 
they were a happy family . 
the corn was only a memory . 
it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting . 
&aw . 
well they're inside the stones of the wall .

and as Frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer . 
was it Frederick's voice ? 
was it magic ? 
and how about the colors Frederick , they asked anxiously . 
close your eyes again Frederick said , and when he told them of the blue periwinkles , the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush , they saw the colors as clearly as if they had been painted in their minds . 
wow . 
and the words , Frederick ? 
Frederick cleared his throat , and then as if from a stage he said +...
