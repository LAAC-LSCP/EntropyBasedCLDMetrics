you wanna see the +//. 
in late summer and fall trees produce seeds . 
okay xxx hello fruity crumble yummy . 
fall leaves +... 
okay well Honey I start reading and then you don't like that page maybe oh +//. 
early fall is the best time to go I didn't know this Honey +... 
early fall is the best time to go hunting for toadstools and mushrooms . 
we should tell Daddy that . 
you can find an astonishing variety in fields and forests and even in gardens . 
toadstools and mushrooms are fungi . 
these are plants that don't have any leaves or flowers but send tiny threads down into other plants or animal &-uh other plants or animal dung and feed on them . 
some fungi grow on dead leaves and others grow on tree trunks or dead logs . 
here are some to look for . 
cepes@s:fra +... 
also known as the porcini I believe . 
has a dark brown cap with pores underneath instead of gills . 
ooh this is a poisonous one we are not allowed to eat that one . 
let's see which ones look like the ones that we see . 
look at that giant puff ball ! 
it's [: it is] a giant puff ball mushroom . 
xxx that's [: that is] very funny . 
Dryad's_Saddle has a pale yellow brown cap with darker scales . 
and a crimson wax cap is red . 
yeah . 
yeah look at those and these are called Chanterelle mushrooms . 
mm: this is called a parasol +... 
(be)cause it looks like an umbrella . 
Sweetie can you eat some of your +... 
cinnamon toast . 
look this is all about spiders Honey . 
is that tasty ? 
xxx the best time to see spiders' webs is early on a fall morning when their fragile threads are strung with beads of dew or mist . 
spiders spin webs to catch insects . 
different spiders have different types of webs . 
hm: . 
that spider's [: spider is] trying to eat that bug . 
don't ya [: you] think ? 
you are right . 
planting . 
many spring flowers grow from bulbs but you hafta plant them in the fall eight to twelve weeks beforehand . 
you can plant them in a garden or in pots . 
you can also plant them in indoor pots as long as you keep them in a cool dark place for two to three months . 
indoor bulbs flower earlier than outdoor ones because it is warmer inside . 
hm: pretty . 
&-uh chocolate cobweb cake ! 
make this delicious cake for a fall party or celebration . 
all of the ingredients are mixed together in the same bowl . 
that looks good doesn't it ? 
yummy ! 
you know what that is ? 
that is a chocolate cake . 
yu:mmy ! 
yummy . 
oh a butterfly how pretty that's [: that is] called a monarch butterfly . 
xxx . 
look at that funny bird . 
oh that's [: that is] a swallow . 
that little bird . 
and this is a hoopoe apparently . 
well &-uh some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter in warmer lands where there's [: there is] plenty of food this is called migration . 
that means when it gets cold out Honey the birds fly south to the warm weather that's [: that is] called migration . 
neat huh ? 
preparing for winter . 
in the fall wherever you live you may find signs of birds and animals getting ready for the winter . 
many of them stock up on food before it becomes scarce and others are preparing shelters or homes to keep them warm and safe for the winter . 
squirrels bury nuts in the fall . 
I'm not sure what kind of butterfly it is but it's [: it is] pretty huh ? 
yeah . 
these star maps will help you identify the constellations that you can see in the night sky in the winter . 
the best time to use the maps is at around eleven P M on a clear night away from city lights . 
but the stars look pretty here . 
I think there were some shooting stars or something like that . 
yes I can . 
winter weather . 
in most parts of the winter winter is colder than other seasons . 
the days are shorter and the nights are longer . 
in countries where the temperature drops below freezing point for much of the winter there is a lot of frost and snow . 
and some places there may be snow on the ground for several months . 
hm: . 
this is neat this says how to make a snow shaker . 
stormy skies . 
water colors are very good for painting moody skies and clouds . 
especially if you wet the paper first . 
before you start a picture try some of the ideas shown below to find out how to create different effects . 
wow . 
look at this you can make clouds . 
oh how pre:tty ! 
ooh and there's [: there is] a castle . 
and stormy stormy air . 
winter buds . 
oh ! 
I think it's [: it is] a tree actually with a little bud . 
see ? 
all the(se) look at all these different little sticks with things growing on them huh ? 
let's see if we can find our tree in the back . 
our tree's [: tree is] a red oak tree . 
I don't see any oaks here . 
here's [: here is] a turkey oak maybe that's [: that is] sort of +... 
sort of like ours . 
let's see . 
look at all those beautiful green leaves . 
that's [: that is] an oak leaf . 
winter trees . 
trees that lose their leaves in winter are called deciduous trees . 
well you learn something every day huh ? 
almost all of them have broad flat leaves . 
deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and grow new ones in the following spring . 
do all the leaves fall to the ground and we rake them up into big piles ? 
or Manny rakes them up for us (be)cause he's [: he is] better at it than we are . 
winter flowers oh look at all +//. 
look for them in sheltered spots in gardens parks and woodlands . 
the crocus sometimes we see little crocus flowers here . 
when winter is over . 
camellias those are pretty huh ? 
baked potatoes ! 
yummy ! 
oh those are tomatoes you're right those are tomatoes and these are potatoes . 
baked potatoes are one of the easiest things to cook and make a warming meal on a winter's day . 
they're potatoes . 
do they look like little rocks ? 
okay this does not sound good to Mommy . 
below are two suggestions for different fillings +... 
tuna and sweet corn . 
does that sound good to you tuna and corn in a potato ? 
but you know maybe it's [: it is] good but +... 
it kind of looks like someone threw up . 
but don't let me hold you back . 
cheese and bacon ooh doesn't that sound good cheese and bacon on a potato ? 
xxx who likes bacon ? 
that sounds good to me does it sound good to you ? 
cheese and bacon you like bacon don't you ? 
so this is how you bake +//. 
you wash your potato . 
and you poke it with a fork . 
and you put it in a hot oven . 
and then it gets all cooked and you cut it open and you can fill it with things . 
yummy . 
that's [: that is] right . 
bird watching . 
it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge . 
this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand . 
know what we should pro(bab)ly do Honey ? 
I think on our tree back there we have a bird feeder but it doesn't have any bird food in it do you think maybe this weekend we should buy some ? 
and then we could see some really neat birds . 
or a cardinal . 
that would be neat . 
hm: . 
oh look it says here we can put bread or cheese or potato or bacon . 
everybody likes bacon . 
(ex)cept for maybe a pig . 
surviving the winter . 
different animals have different ways of coping with the cold weather and lack of food in winter . 
some of them go to sleep all winter that's [: that is] called hibernation . 
that's [: that is] a little sleeping hedgehog . 
this is a marmot . 
it's [: it is] a(n) alpine marmot . 
alpine marmots seal themselves into their burrows underground and sleep for the winter . 
that is they sleep for half the year . 
well that's [: that is] right caterpillars will turn into butterflies right ? 
bugs that's [: that is] right sometimes they shed their skin . 
let's see what it says about summer and spring okay ? 
xxx &aw look at the pretty paper daisies you can make . 
that's [: that is] very pretty . 
yeah but this would be a pretty thing to make one day . 
we should make this with Phoebe I bet she would like to make these don't you think ? 
would you like to take your Cinderella wig off Sweetie ? 
looks pretty snazzy . 
plant flower seeds indoors early in spring and they will flower in the summer . 
here you can see how to grow pansies from seeds but you can plant most other small flower seeds in the same way . 
you fill the little containers with soil . 
and you put two little seeds in each section . 
cover the box with newspaper and leave it outside . 
water every few days . 
that's [: that is] interesting . 
I did not know that . 
after two weeks shoots will appear . 
that is very very interesting . 
hm: . 
how (a)bout that . 
soak the egg box xxx wow you can plant them in the little egg box . 
I did not even know that . 
and put them in a big pot . 
is that a bad piece . 
of the bread ? 
no hm: . 
you know what I don't have any more bread those were our last two slices Mommy has to go buy some more bread . 
I don't have any more but I can get you something else . 
we hafta go to the supermarket to buy it . 
from tadpole to frog . 
early in the spring frogs lay their eggs which are called frog spawn . 
&-uh a newt ! 
that's [: that is] a newt . 
newt ! 
it's [: it is] a newt ! 
it's [: it is] a newt . 
okay . 
frogs lay their eggs in clumps of clear jelly which float to the surface of the pond . 
after about ten days tadpoles wiggle out . 
that's [: that is] what they look like it kind of looks +//. 
and they swim in search of food . 
the tadpoles then grow legs . 
and they come to the surface of the water to breathe . 
after twelve or thirteen weeks the tadpoles have turned into tiny frogs . 
oh look at all these eggs that you can decorate look how pretty these are . 
that's [: that is] right did you go xxx did you go on an egg hunt last year ? 
yeah she's [: she is] a good egg hunter . 
you're right . 
oh look ! 
&aw look at the baby animals ! 
&aw and what are these ? 
oh summer . 
summer summer summer . 
&-uh ! 
caterpillar caterpillar . 
spring is a good time to look for caterpillars you might spot some in a garden or out in the country . 
many of them live on leaves but you may also find one wiggling across a path in search of its food plant . 
he is looking at you . 
the tiny caterpillar eats and eats and grows bigger and bigger . 
and then it makes a hard case called a pupa around itself . 
or a cocoon . 
well this is the little cocoon they make around themselves and when they come out of the cocoon what are they ? 
well this is a butterfly but a caterpillar can also turn into a moth . 
a moth is a moth . 
that is tomatoes and mozzarella cheese with fresh basil . 
we had mozzarella and tomatoes last week when Manny brought us lots of yummy tomatoes right ? 
you want something to eat now ? 
well how would you go about asking for that water ? 
xxx . 
let me hold this (un)til you get up on the couch . 
can you scooch over a little ? 
thank you very much .

yeah delicious . 
xxx mm strawberries . 
that's [: that is] yummy . 
hm: summer flowers oh that's [: that is] very pretty . 
&-uh bug watch ! 
what are those ? 
&-um that's [: that is] another type that's [: that is] called a devil's coach horse beetle . 
and this is a green shield beetle . 
and this is a click beetle . 
that apparently is a cockchafer beetle . 
&-um beetles eat all kinds of plants and animals and there are thousands of different beetles living everywhere . 
ants live together in enormous groups called colonies and they make nests by burrowing in sand or soil . 
if you watch where a line of ants goes you will probably find their nest hole . 
the ants work hard carrying food and other things back to the colony . 
they leave a scent trail between the food they find and the nest so the rest of the ants will know which way they went . 
bees there's [: there is] a little bumble+bee . 
bees feed on nectar a sweet liquid found inside most flowers . 
most bees gather nectar from one type of flower at a time . 
as a bee flies from flower to flower it also gathers pollen . 
the sticky yellow dust inside flowers . 
it carries the pollen to other flowers and this helps the flowers to make new seeds . 
that's [: that is] great . 
okay you hold the bug page open Honey . 
okay ? 
you know what we may Sweetie what we may do later ? 
we may hafta stop at the mall okay ? 
xxx we don't need to get beetles at the mall but we hafta get you socks you need socks at the mall . 
did you learn anything exciting about bugs while I was gone ? 
what did you learn ? 
did you find did you learn that let's see +... 
dragonflies fly low above ponds and streams early in the summer . 
their brightly colored bodies flash as they swoop across the water chasing insects . 
you may see them resting on leaves their wings outstretched in the sun . 
butterflies and moths are attracted to brightly colored scented flowers . 
like bees they feed on nectar . 
yeah there's [: there is] a butterfly . 
hm: . 
interesting . 
okay &-uh snail trail . 
a damp shady place that's [: that is] where they like .

those are baby baby &-uh snails . 
a snail has two pairs of tentacles . 
it smells with one pair and has eyes on the other .

my_goodness . 
oh the slime the slime ! 
xxx it's [: it is] a little yucky but it's [: it is] neat too . 
well you could touch some that's [: that is] true I guess . 
snails usually come out to feed at night or after rain . 
this is because their skin is not waterproof +... 
that's [: that is] a snail he's [: he is] on top of a banana . 
that's [: that is] the snail . 
an(d) that's [: that is] his shell . 
in the winter or hot weather snails hide in shady spots they close themselves into their shells with slime . 
most snails feed on plants and are especially fond of soft growing shoots . 
xxx interesting very interesting . 
if you go to a beach you can have fun looking for shells pebbles and other treasures . 
it's [: it is] best to explore at low tide when the sea is out . 
oh yes xxx you're right !

that house down there has a rock with numbers painted on it . 
it's [: it is] like that only they painted flowers and things on these rocks .

harvest time . 
many different foods and drinks are made from plants . 
fruit and vegetables come from plants but so do other everyday foods such as flour coffee cocoa oil and sugar . 
xxx cocoa comes from a plant Honey do you know what cocoa makes ? 
chocolate . 
you make chocolate out of cocoa beans . 
most plant foods are grown as crops and are picked or harvested in the summer . 
xxx grain crops . 
look for combine harvesters working in the fields late in the summer . 
these huge machines harvest crops such as wheat oats rye and barley . 
that are grown for their seeds or grain . 
combine harvesters don't just cut they crop they also gather it together and separate the grain from the stalk . 
the grain is ground into flour or used to make bread or breakfast cereal . 
neat . 
what are these ? 
oh you know what they look just like the black-eyed-susans it's [: it is] hard to tell in this picture but those are sunflowers .

d(id) we go picking +//? 
yeah we picked blueberries and raspberries right ? 
oh: look ! 
if the sun comes out between clouds when it's [: it is] raining it shines through the drops of water and you may suddenly see a rainbow . 
rainbows are always on the opposite side of the sky from the sun so you hafta stand with your back to the sun to see them . 
colors in a rainbow are always in the same order . 
red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet . 
wow . 
in spring the weather can change very quickly . 
strong winds and sudden showers are often followed by rainbows or sunshine . 
you can find out how strong the wind is by looking out for the signs around you . 
the wind is the wind blowing very fast ? 
the wind is too fast ?

they flew through the trees spying down from the sky and asked all the butterflies fluttering by . 
but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone . 
she then asked a small spider as plump as a pig +... 
have you seen my mom she's [: she is] like me +... 
the sly spider laughed as he gobbled his snack a bear is a mother who's [: who is] yellow and black . 
with her heart full of joy she peered over her straw but it wasn't her mother that Miss Spider saw . 
it was six hungry hatchlings and a goldfinch who cried your dinner's [: dinner is] here darlings so open up wide . 
before she could blink she was whisked out of sight and brave beetle Betty was hugging her +... 
in her warm cozy home in the bark of a tree the kind beetle asked won't you stay here +...

lived a beautiful and clever princess Jasmine . 
the Sultan's law stated the princess had to marry a prince by her next birthday and time was running out . 
Jasmine it's [: it is] the law the Sultan insisted it'll be your birthday in just three days . 
I don't love Prince Akhmed Jasmine replied oh Father how can you force me to marry someone I don't love . 
Jasmine held back her tears as her father left the palace garden . 
oh Raja she said to her pet tiger what ever will I do . 
she looked up at the high walls surrounding the palace . 
if she could just climb over that wall she'd [: she would] be free . 
so that night Jasmine disguised herself . 
Raja was sad to see Jasmine leave but he still helped his friend escape . 
once over the palace wall Jasmine suddenly found herself alone in a world she had never before experienced . 
Agrabah's bustling marketplace .
