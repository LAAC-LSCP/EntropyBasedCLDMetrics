okay . 
alrighty . 
okay which one should we read first ? 
Paddington . 
do you remember what this one's [: one is] called ? 
what's this one called ? 
wow . 
one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor gardens Mrs Brown thought she would take him out shopping . 
we're going to the Portobello Road explained Judy . 
it's a big outdoor market quite near here . 
you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan there's [: there is] a lot to see . 
do you remember that I told you that Mommy and Daddy went to Portobello Road and bought something ? 
you know the there's [: there is] a little picture above your armoire in your room ? 
it's a picture of a mommy and her little girl . 
and Daddy and I bought that at Portobello Road . 
yeah . 
before we even had you . 
(be)cause we knew we were gonna have a little Lily . 
yeah . 
xxx . 
we'll finish this first though . 
Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off . 
suddenly they turned a corner and Paddington found himself in what seemed like a different world . 
a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit vegetables people . 
his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in . 
one store was even having its picture taken . 
that's a new supermarket said Judy there must be something special going on there . 
Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the glass . 
perhaps I could do some shopping for you Mrs Brown he asked hopefully . 
Mrs Brown hesitated she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon . 
but Jonathan told her not to worry even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said . 
what goes in must come out . 
we can meet him by the checkout counter on our way back added Judy . 
Paddington felt most important as he entered the store . 
he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door and then consulted Mrs Brown's shopping list . 
everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans . 
there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade . 
he could certainly see why it was called a super market . 
what do you like to get at the supermarket ? 
you like to get drinks at the supermarket ? 
that's true we do hafta get some drinks don't we we hafta get some juice and some milk . 
what else do you like to get at the supermarket ? 
lemonade +... 
excellent any food that you like to get at the supermarket ? 
&-um even more drinks wow . 
that's a lot of drinks . 
his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he had left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming toward him pushing a large basket on wheels . 
may I suggest you use one of these sir he called . 
you can take as much as you want now he continued . 
can I really exclaimed Paddington . 
the manager nodded yes we like to make our customers happy . 
Paddington looked most impressed . 
in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure . 
the more Paddington saw at the supermarket the more he liked . 
he felt sure Mrs Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries . 
the other customers looked on in amazement . 
perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady . 
what's she wearing ? 
whoop . 
but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddinton with interest . 
since he had been in the store the manager had been joined by several other important looking men . 
and as Paddington reached the checkout counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap . 
what do you see in his basket ? 
yeah wh(at) do you see anything that you recognize ? 
I think I see some +... 
right there's [: there is] some chicken over there and some +... 
and +... 
do you know what this one is here ? 
that is actually looks just like lettuce that I think is cauliflower . 
well you're right Daddy doesn't like cauliflower . 
I think Auntie likes cauliflower . 
and Mommy likes cauliflower . 
great ! 
Paddington had never been to a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy . 
and he gave the men a friendly wave as he unloaded his baskets . 
well done said the lady handing him a ticket . 
I hope you've brought a truck with you . 
there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here . 
Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw . 
hundred and fifty dollars worth he said giving the man who had said he could take as much as he wanted one of his hardest stares . 
he opened his suitcase and peered inside . 
but I've only got a nickel . 
what's he going to do ? 
oh no ! 
looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him . 
watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for his groceries but it was too late . 
with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter . 
Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on . 
all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being . 
she has a surprised face I think . 
she's going what happened ! 
that's what she's saying . 
(be)cause he's hiding under all the groceries . 
gr:eat ! 
you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult . 
a prize echoed the Browns . 
the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall . 
this young bear he said happens to be our one thousan(dth) thousandth customer today . 
perhaps you'd like to tell him he's [: he has] won a free supp(ly) supply of groceries ? 
all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet . 
even in supermarkets agreed Jonathan . 
Paddington sniffed the air happily . 
I like the Portobello Road he said I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on .

right so that my cough won't be bad .

we bought this sweater for you when we went to Ireland . 
I bet you don't even remember that . 
and but we have pictures from it . 
you know what you ate a lot of when we were in Ireland ? 
a lot of chocolate . 
and when we took our big long airplane ride . 
this is what they gave you for lunch ready ? 
they gave you fish (a)n(d) chips . 
which you didn't wanna eat (be)cause it was just kind of this weird fried fish . 
and you didn't like it . 
and then they gave you chocolate pudding with chocolate sprinkles . 
and then they gave you little chocolate M and Ms . 
and then they gave you a chocolate bar too . 
you liked that too . 
so you ate all your chocolate and you were bouncing off the walls (be)cause you were so full of chocolate energy . 
it's true . 
(be)cause they were on a school trip . 
and they thought you were very cute and they would bring you toys . 
they would come and talk to you and bring you little stuffed animals to keep you happy . 
and it took us so long to get home and you slept almost not at all . 
it took us I think sixteen hours maybe to get home . 
oh you were so tired . 
but you didn't wanna sleep . 
oh my . 
it was ridiculous . 
Daddy did a good job of that .

xxx . 
oh boy . 
oh boy . 
you do ? 
Franklin rides a bike . 
Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run . 
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings . 
did you climb the monkey bars at school ? 
yes that's [: that is] right you were taking turns . 
but Franklin had a problem . 
he couldn't ride his bicycle without training wheels . 
in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes . 
Beaver was the brave one and she took her wheels off first . 
she took the training wheels off see she has no little wheels on the back . 
look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself . 
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles . 
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handlebar with the other . 
oh yeah he's not his bike must be off +... 
out of the picture . 
maybe I think you're right . 
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike . 
he wanted to ride all by himself . 
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push . 
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered then he fell into the flower bed . 
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again . 
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out . 
he watched as his friends rode off without him . 
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes . 
there's [: there is] Badger too you're right . 
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house . 
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother . 
I can't ride without my training wheels said Franklin . 
did you give it your best effort asked his mother . 
well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time . 
Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he cried . 
his mother held on to the seat . 
try it I won't let you go until you tell me to . 
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind . 
he felt unsteady and very unsure . 
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling . 
but you can't give up just because it's frustrating . 
it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends . 
do you think everything comes easily for him she asked . 
Franklin had to think about that . 
Franklin went to the park . 
he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars . 
each time she got to the third rung she fell to the sand below . 
whoa . 
yay . 
oh_goodness gracious . 
oh: goodness gracious .

oh .
