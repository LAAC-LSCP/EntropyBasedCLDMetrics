Thomas and the big , big bridge ! 
this is your favorite book these days . 
it was a special day for railway +//. 
don't touch the track ? 
you want me to leave it on the floor ? 
okay . 
we can do that . 
take care of it later . 
okay ? 
we are here to launch the new rail line through the mountains of Sodor , sir Toppenhat announced . 
today we open the bi:g , bi:g bridge . 
what wonderful news , everyone cheered . 
the mountains were beautiful . 
the people of Soder couldn't wait to visit them . 
xxx , there it is ! 
what's that ? 
it's a big , big bridge , that's right . 
everyone wanted to see the big , big bridge . 
it had towers so high that tops touched the sky . 
and the valley beneath was so deep that when you were on the big , big bridge , you could barely see the ground ! 
Thomas was excited about the new rail line . 
this is really a special day , he said happily . 
look , who's this ? 
is that Henry , and then Henry chugged up to Thomas +... 
the big engine frowned . 
I don't want to go to the mountains , Henry said nervously . 
it's windy up there , very very windy . 
Henry didn't like the wind . 
Henry didn't like rain , or snow , or hail either . 
we're a big engine Henry , Thomas said , you shouldn't be afraid of a little wind ! 
but Henry was afraid . 
that made Thomas a bit afraid too . 
look at , there's everybody , who's this here ? 
that's right ! 
Gordon , Henry , Thomas , hitch up your coaches , called sir Toppenhat . 
it's time for your first trip to the mountains ! 
Percy and James were glad they didn't hafta go to the mountains . 
they were afraid to cross the bi:g , big bridge . 
there's nothing to be afraid of , Thomas insisted +... 
in a voice loud enough for Percy and James to hear . 
it will be easy to cross the big , big bridge ! 
ah , who's that ? 
that's Thomas . 
his coaches were full of passengers . 
Annie and Clarabelle were soon hitched behind Thomas . 
hurry hurry , they called . 
who's that ? 
that's Thomas and that's the conductor . 
this is sir Toppenhat . 
that was very good . 
and this is the conductor . 
all aboar:d ! 
cried the conductor . 
Sir Toppenhat turned to the crowd and waved his hat one last time . 
toot_toot , Gordon whistled . 
follow me ! 
in a burst of steam , the big blue engine was off . 
soon the trains were rolling through the country+side in a lo:ng line . 
Gordon took the lead . 
here's Gordon . 
behind him chugged Henry , and then because he was the smallest ca:me +... 
who's that ? 
that's Thomas , that's right . 
well all along the way , people came out of the house , and cheered when they saw the trains go by . 
at the foot of the mountain , Henry slowed to a crawl . 
these mountains are much too high , he moaned . 
I can't go , I'm afraid of heights . 
don't be silly , Thomas said bravely . 
I'll be right here behind you . 
but Henry didn't budge . 
he was nervous . 
that made (.) Thomas nervous too . 
c'mon [: come on] , Thomas (.) gently pushed Henry . 
we hafta go ! 
the brand new tracks were smooth and shiny . 
but Henry barely moved along them . 
the truth was , Henry didn't want to reach the top of the mountain . 
because then he'd hafta cross the big , big bridge . 
if Percy and James and Henry are all afraid , thought Thomas , maybe I should be frightened too . 
finally Thomas and Henry arrived at the top of the mountain . 
there it was , what's that ? 
xxx , that's right a bi:g , big bridge , and there's tracks on it too . 
you're right . 
and it was high ! 
it was windy up there , too . 
very windy . 
I won't go , Henry declared . 
but we hafta cross , Thomas said bravely . 
our passengers want to see the mountains on the other side . 
hurry hurry , Annie and Clarabelle cried . 
the coaches were so excited that Thomas had trouble keeping them in line . 
Thomas searched the tracks ahead . 
Gordon was nowhere to be seen . 
he had already crossed the big bridge and rolled into the mountains beyond . 
Thomas and Henry were alone . 
I'll go first , Thomas said at last . 
then you can follow me , Henry ! 
if the wind blows , close your eyes , Henry said , that way you won't see anything scary ! 
here +... 
what's this one say ? 
that's right ! 
there's a click and a clack@o . 
the big , big bridge . 
ye:s , there's a click_clack@o because he +//. 
his wheels came off the track . 
right ? 
xxx you alright Thomas , Henry called . 
I'm stuck , Thomas said glumly , I couldn't see where I was going and my front wheels have jumped the track ! 
just then Gordon returned and he frowned when he saw Thomas stuck in the middle of the bridge . 
go find Harold , Gordon xxx cried to Henry . 
relieved , Henry backed down the mountain to find the helicopter . 
Thomas kept his eyes closed , he was too afraid to look . 
but inside his coaches , the passengers enjoyed the wonderful view . 
finally , Thomas heard the whir of rotors . 
xxx , there he is , Harold was here to rescue him ! 
slowly , Thomas opened his eyes , he looked at the blue sky above and the green mountains all around +... 
no , please do . 
yeah , daddy's going to work . 
he's got poops ? 
he's got a heinie , yeah that's a tag honey , that's not poops . 
that's a tag ! 
that says +... 
that is your teddy+bear , William . 
it is . 
xxx .

I'm watching teddy+bear . 
oh: , is teddy+bear playing the piano ? 
I think William's a much better pianist than the teddy+bear . 
you want me to do it ? 
oh: , I want you !

I think you're better .
