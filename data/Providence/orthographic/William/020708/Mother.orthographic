hm: . 
this is Gerald . 
but his knees were awfully crooked and their legs +//. 
he was very good at standing still and munching shoots off trees . 
but when he tried to run around , he buckled at the knees . 
see here's a jungle dance . 
and this year when the day arrived , poor Gerald felt so sad +... 
because when it came to dancing , he was really very bad . 
the wart+hogs started waltzing and the rhinos rock and rolled +... 
the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold . 
are they dancing ? 
and eight baboons that +//. 
or a splendid Scottish xxx . 
Gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor but the lions saw him coming and they soon began to roar . 
hey look at clumsy Gerald the animals all sneered . 
giraffes can't dance you silly fool . 
yes , you're right . 
so he crept off on the dance floor and he started walking home . 
he'd never felt so sad before and so sad and so alone . 
then he found a little clearing +... 
and he looked up at the sky . 
the moon can be so beautiful +... 
he whispered with a sigh . 
excuse me coughed a cricket , who'd seen Gerald early on . 
but sometimes when you're different , you just need a different song . 
listen to the swaying grass listen to the trees . 
he's closing his eyes and he's listening +... 
everything makes music if you really want it to . 
with that the cricket smiled and picked up his violin +... 
and Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing . 
his hooves had started shuffling making circles on the ground . 
his neck was gently swaying +... 
and his tail was swishing (a)round . 
and then he threw his arms out sideways and he swung them everywhere . 
then he did a backwards somersault and leaped up in the air . 
Gerald felt so wonderful . 
I'm dancing yes I'm dancing . 
I'm dancing Gerald cried . 
yeah it's a miracle . 
Gerald's [: Gerald is] the best dancer that we've ever ever seen . 
how did you learn to dance like that ? 
but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow . 
then he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above . 
mwah@o I love you .

this is called make way for ducklings by Robert McCloskey . 
Mr and Mrs Mallard were looking for a place to live . 
but everytime Mr Mallard saw what looked like a nice place , Mrs Mallard said it was no good . 
there was sure to be foxes in the woods or turtles in the water . 
and she was not going to raise a family where there might be foxes and turtles . 
so they flew on and on . 
when they got to Boston , they felt too tired to fly any farther . 
there was a nice pond in the public gardens +... 
with a little island on it . 
the very place to spend the night quacked Mr Mallard . 
so they +//. 
next morning they fished for their breakfast in the (.) in the mud at the bottom of the pond . 
but they didn't find much . 
just as they were getting ready to start on their way a strange and enormous bird came by . 
it was pushing a boat full of people and there was a man sitting on its back . 
good morning quacked Mr Mallard , being polite . 
the big bird was too proud to answer . 
the people on the boat threw peanuts into the water and so the Mallards followed them all around the pond and got another breakfast . 
better than the first . 
I like this place said Mrs Mallard +... 
as they climbed out on the bank . 
and waddled along . 
why don't we build a nest and raise our ducklings right in this pond . 
there are no foxes and no turtles and the people feed us peanuts . 
what could be better ? 
good said Mr Mallard , delighted at last Mrs Mallard had found a place that suited her . 
but +... 
look out squawked Mrs Mallard . 
xxx . 
you'll get run over . 
with all those horrid things rushing about we'll hafta look somewhere else . 
what's that ? 
that's right . 
pedals . 
so they flew over Beacon Hill and around the State House . 
but there's no place there . 
they looked in Louisburg Square . 
but there was no water to swim in . 
then they flew over the Charles River . 
this is better quacked Mrs Mallard . 
xxx looks like (.) quite (.) like a nice quiet place . 
it's only a little away from the public garden . 
yes said Mrs Mallard , remembering the peanuts . 
that looks just (.) that looks like just the right place to hatch ducklings . 
so they chose a cozy spot on one of the bushes near the water and settled down to build their nest . 
and only just in time for now they were beginning to xxx . 
all their old wing feathers start to drop out . 
and would not be able to fly again until the new ones grew in . 
but of course they could swim and one day they swam over to the park on the river xxx and there they met a policeman called Michael . 
Michael fed them peanuts . 
and after that the Mallards called upon Michael every day . 
after Mrs Mallard had laid eight eggs in the nest she couldn't go visit Michael anymore . 
(be)cause she had to sit on the eggs to keep them warm . 
she moved off the nest only to get a drink of water or to have her lunch or to count the eggs and make sure they were all there . 
one day the ducklings hatched out . 
Mr and Mrs Mallard were bursting with pride . 
it's a great responsibility taking care of so many ducklings and they kept them very busy . 
yeah there's a mommy . 
one day +... 
Mr Mallard decided he'd like to take a trip to see what the rest of the river was like . 
xxx . 
off he sat (.) set +... 
don't you worry said Mrs Mallard I know all about bringing up children . 
and she did . 
she taught them how to swim +... 
and di:ve . 
she taught them to walk in a lines , to come when they were called , and to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels . 
when at last she felt perfectly satisfied with them , she said one morning come along children follow me . 
before you could wink an eyelash Jack , Kack , Clack , Mack , Nack , Quack , Pack , Quack fell into a line . 
just as they had been taught . 
Mrs Mallard led the way to the water and they swam behind her to the opposite bank .
