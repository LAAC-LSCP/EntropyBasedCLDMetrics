I know 
no Max's first 
crab 
like a suit of armor a crab shell protects it from attackers 
a crab has two claws for holding and tearing food and for fighting 
if a crab's claw breaks off a new one grows back 
a crab's eyes are on stalks and can move in all directions 
when a crab grows too big for its shell the shell splits and the and the crab climbs out of it 
the crab then grows a new shell 
crabs live along the coastlines in cracks and under plants 
in tide pools or in burrows in sand 
look at this guy 
a crab walks quickly moving sideways 
on its eight back legs 
some crabs hide by covering themselves with plants and other objects 
a crab's shell matches the color of the rocks plants or sand where it lives 
oh that's probably why they have those piggy crabs 
cause they match with the sand and the the dirt in there right 
yeah
