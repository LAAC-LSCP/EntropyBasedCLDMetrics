and the needle stuck into the balloon and pop 
midnight sky 
it's a girl looking at the stars 
see the stars 
 
when the sun sets at the end of the day the night sky begins to twinkle and shine 
there are many things to see in the night sky 
the moon is the brightest light in the night sky 
sometimes the moon looks thin and curved 
it looks different at different times of the month 
see there's the moon 
and the moon sometimes looks like this 
millions of stars twinkle in the night sky 
some look brighter than others 
some look blue and some look white 
groups of stars that form patterns in the sky are called constellations 
see this one's called the little dipper 
this one called the big dipper 
in the night sky are planets 
they look like stars but they do not twinkle 
you might see Venus shining brightly in the east 
it looks like the moon but it's actually called Venus 
comets blaze across the sky 
comets don't pass by often
