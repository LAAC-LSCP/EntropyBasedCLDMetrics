the long haired boy  
there was a boy in our town with long hair  I mean really long hair  
and everybody pointed at him and laughed at him and made fun of him  
and when he walked down the street  the people would roar and stick out their tongues and make funny faces  
and run in and slam the door and shut em 
from the window until he couldn't stand anymore  so he sat down and cried  
till his whole body shook  and pretty soon his hair shook too  
and it flapped and flapped and lifted and flew  
wow  
the longest nose in the world belongs to Betsy blue bonnet  
who lets me write things on it

and so today I peeled it off the wall where it was leaning  and stuck it in the wash tub with the clothes  
I put in the soap and the bleach and stuff  I let it soak for hours  
I wrung it out and hung it to dry  
and who would ever thunk  
that it would have gone and shrunk  
for now it's so much littler than I
