that's great William 
that's very good 
oh 
is this the piece you were 
where does it look like that red would go 
yeah 
you think so 
where's the red on the dinosaur 
I think you're right 
oh you know what 
there you go 
oh very good that's right 
hm 
look at patterns 
do you see that pattern on that piece that you have in your hand 
you do where is it 
the one you just put 
look at this piece 
and look at this piece 
is there any patterns that match 
oh 
I see 
let's look for that pattern 
 
oh 
mhm 
I know I don't know 
where oh where could it be 
there it is 
oh 
just a little piece cause it's almost the end 
wonder where it could be 
you betcha 
we're looking for her tail huh 
we're lookin' for we're lookin' for body 
I don't know 
hm 
oh that does look like it would be the tail of that dinosaur doesn't it 
let's see what's down here 
oh well you know what 
you could always look at this picture 
whoops that's why I have 
yeah that's why I have the picture there because um that's a good reference when you see what it looks like you're gonna see what the picture is that you're looking for 
right 
you do 
there's this dinosaur right here 
I don't 
that's what we need to be looking for ah 
you do 
it looks like that's 
if you look at this picture right 
I think we need to find something in between there 
yeah you just hafta look at all the 
you do 
yeah 
I'm gonna put this overhead light on cause maybe we can see better 
me 
how bout we look at this one 
look it I'll try it I'll do it 
you think so 
oh see how bout that 
I know 
lemme see 
look at the picture 
where do you think that would fit 
where do you think it looks like it matches to 
that looks like that's where the body would go hm 
I'm not sure that that would go there William 
look at the colors 
you're looking for 
look it you see this is like this and it's like this 
right 
how bout the 
this color it goes 
well there's a little bit here but it doesn't seem to match the picture 
does it look like maybe it could go down here 
how do you think it would fit there 
ah 
there you go 
you did it 
looks like there some leaves here 
and some leaves here 
see the leaves 
do you think that might work 
you did it 
what d'you mean you can't do it it's done 
what d'you wanna look for now

looks like the body 
that's the 
and you're gonna look for little arms

I think that might go over that way by those flowers 
well that 
cause it maybe 
that's the corner so it's over here somewhere 
that's all 
I don't know if that goes there 
that might not go there either 
uh and this looks like it might be part of that grouping over there
