you don't like it 
okay well you can sit down and have some soup you like that 
okay 
c'mon William

did you enjoy going to school today I bet it was really fun you haven't been to school in a long time 
did you talk about baby bop in school 
I bet you did not 
a lot of fun with Theo today 
that bowl's a little tall for you maybe I could 
should we put this in a smaller bowl William would it be easier 
how bout we put it in this bowl 
y'wanna put it in this bowl 
here 
here is that easier 
for you to get to 
hm 
that 
when you sit in your highchair I think it makes you taller 
an so 
that bowl is okay but this bowl 
is easier when you're sitting like that 
I still think it'd be better if you were taller 
this bowl has letters on it 
see some of the letters 
you can look on the outside see 
that's the letter a 
that's right 
was that a car horn 
I don't think we'll be able to see it

can you say excuse me 
welcome 
no thank you 
mommy's gonna have some later but mommy's not hungry right now

not right now 
lemme just wipe your mouth off a little bit okay 
not right now 
maybe if we move this a little closer to you 
here 
yeah it's the a 
how come we're being quiet

William 
that's a very interesting way to eat soup
