I can help you  I'd love to help you

you want mommy to go get it  
okay  you stay here and start putting your tracks together then  
kay  
can you start putting the tracks together  
like this  
here's this  
 
what d'ya say  
your welcome  
okay  
well  should we put a track together  do you wanna make it a simple one  do you wanna just go around  
okay hold on  lemme just get this here 
 
here  
put this under the tunnel  
 you can put the tunnel on top of that one  if you want  
you wanna have it that way  
alright  we can do that  
let's see 
okay  
well honey  don't  don't push things like that  okay  
be gentle  remember we talked about being gentle  
turn around  
okay well I think 
that maybe we should do it this way  
so we can come around this way  
does that sound like maybe a good idea to you  
you just wanna do a simple track  like this  
is that what you would like  William  
you want the tunnel  
okay wait  where  where  where do you want the tunnel  do you wanna put it right here  
right here  
like this  
 
you want a hill  
oh  you want it to come up like that too  
okay let's do this  mommy's gonna get down here 
we're gonna make it like we did yesterday then  right  
is that what you want  
that's fine  
so 
let's do that  then  
okay  
 
actually 
what am I doing  
I 
am making 
isn't this what you want  
see what mommy's doing  
wouldja like to help me  
I would like it if you help me  
what happened to it  
there it is  
oh  I think it's a schoolbus  William  
you're gonna go watch the schoolbus  
what mommy needs  
I need the other piece that's like this  William  
you know where it is  
I need another one that's like this  
you see  see how it's curved up  
so that we can have a hill  
that's what we need  see how it goes like this  
we need the other one that looks like that  can you help me find it  
see the difference  
see  this one's curved  
see this one can go up  and this one can't  
that's why this one is a hill  
okay see  if we do this 
it doesn't stay  
see  it takes it up here  
this one  because it's not curved  
so we need to find one that's curved  
shall we look for one  
I know  well  let me show you William  over here we have some more tracks in here  
see  
and here's another one  
see this is where your tracks are  right in the red bin  
see them  
down there  
see  
and see how this one's curved  too  
now let's match them  hold on one second  I wanna show you something  it's a good thing you pulled out  
that's a flat one  
right  
what's this one  
see  
those would go together  
cause they're both flat  
now 
see these  
see  these 
if they had something to support it underneath 
go together  
and that makes a hill  
you see  
see  we can go like this 
and there's your hill  
it goes up and then down  
hm  
that's not quite going to work  
you get it  
you are too cute  
I'm glad you get it  William  
you get it too  
I wonder 
if perhaps I can 
William  could you get me another one  
could you get me another piece of track that looks like this  
please  
can you get me one that looks like this  
 
 
does this one look like that  
yeah

I don't know

Thomas and the big  big bridge  
I got some of your favorite books  
okay  
you wanna sit on mommy's lap  
come on  
you don't wanna read Thomas and the big  big bridge  
yeah  
 my guy  
Thomas and the big  big bridge  
this is your favorite book these days  
it was a special day for railway 
don't touch the track  
you want me to leave it on the floor  
okay  
we can do that  
take care of it later  
okay  
we are here to launch the new rail line through the mountains of Sodor  sir Toppenhat announced  
today we open the big  big bridge  
what wonderful news  everyone cheered  
the mountains were beautiful  
the people of Soder couldn't wait to visit them  
 there it is  
what's that  
it's a big  big bridge  that's right  
everyone wanted to see the big  big bridge  
it had towers so high that tops touched the sky  
and the valley beneath was so deep that when you were on the big  big bridge  you could barely see the ground  
Thomas was excited about the new rail line  
this is really a special day  he said happily  
look  who's this  
is that Henry  and then Henry chugged up to Thomas 
the big engine frowned  
I don't want to go to the mountains  Henry said nervously  
it's windy up there  very very windy  
Henry didn't like the wind  
Henry didn't like rain  or snow  or hail either  
we're a big engine Henry  Thomas said  you shouldn't be afraid of a little wind  
but Henry was afraid  
that made Thomas a bit afraid too  
look at  there's everybody  who's this here  
that's right  
Gordon  Henry  Thomas  hitch up your coaches  called sir Toppenhat  
it's time for your first trip to the mountains  
Percy and James were glad they didn't hafta go to the mountains  
they were afraid to cross the big  big bridge  
there's nothing to be afraid of  Thomas insisted 
in a voice loud enough for Percy and James to hear  
it will be easy to cross the big  big bridge  
ah  who's that  
that's Thomas  
his coaches were full of passengers  
Annie and Clarabelle were soon hitched behind Thomas  
hurry hurry  they called  
who's that  
that's Thomas and that's the conductor  
this is sir Toppenhat  
that was very good  
and this is the conductor  
all aboard  
cried the conductor  
Sir Toppenhat turned to the crowd and waved his hat one last time  
toottoot  Gordon whistled  
follow me  
in a burst of steam  the big blue engine was off  
soon the trains were rolling through the countryside in a long line  
Gordon took the lead  
here's Gordon  
behind him chugged Henry  and then because he was the smallest came 
who's that  
that's Thomas  that's right  
well all along the way  people came out of the house  and cheered when they saw the trains go by  
at the foot of the mountain  Henry slowed to a crawl  
these mountains are much too high  he moaned  
I can't go  I'm afraid of heights  
don't be silly  Thomas said bravely  
I'll be right here behind you  
but Henry didn't budge  
he was nervous  
that made Thomas nervous too  
c'mon  Thomas gently pushed Henry  
we hafta go  
the brand new tracks were smooth and shiny  
but Henry barely moved along them  
the truth was  Henry didn't want to reach the top of the mountain  
because then he'd hafta cross the big  big bridge  
if Percy and James and Henry are all afraid  thought Thomas  maybe I should be frightened too  
finally Thomas and Henry arrived at the top of the mountain  
there it was  what's that  
 that's right a big  big bridge  and there's tracks on it too  
you're right  
and it was high  
it was windy up there  too  
very windy  
I won't go  Henry declared  
but we hafta cross  Thomas said bravely  
our passengers want to see the mountains on the other side  
hurry hurry  Annie and Clarabelle cried  
the coaches were so excited that Thomas had trouble keeping them in line  
Thomas searched the tracks ahead  
Gordon was nowhere to be seen  
he had already crossed the big bridge and rolled into the mountains beyond  
Thomas and Henry were alone  
I'll go first  Thomas said at last  
then you can follow me  Henry  
if the wind blows  close your eyes  Henry said  that way you won't see anything scary  
here 
what's this one say  
that's right  
there's a click and a c l a c k  
the big  big bridge  
yes  there's a c l i c k  c l a c k because he 
his wheels came off the track  
right  
you alright Thomas  Henry called  
I'm stuck  Thomas said glumly  I couldn't see where I was going and my front wheels have jumped the track  
just then Gordon returned and he frowned when he saw Thomas stuck in the middle of the bridge  
go find Harold  Gordon cried to Henry  
relieved  Henry backed down the mountain to find the helicopter  
Thomas kept his eyes closed  he was too afraid to look  
but inside his coaches  the passengers enjoyed the wonderful view  
finally  Thomas heard the whir of rotors  
 there he is  Harold was here to rescue him  
slowly  Thomas opened his eyes  he looked at the blue sky above and the green mountains all around
