we'll hafta clean your hands when you're finished  
like this maybe  
try to hold it higher if you can  
oh  
these markers aren't meant to be slammed down like that  
those are the other markers  
they're different markers  
did you wanna play with those  
okay  
alright  
hold on one second  I'm gonna bring this over too  
um  these are the markers that you can slam down with  not those  
these are the kind that you 
okay  
uhhuh  
I can  
it unscrews  
so those are the ones 
do you want me to move this w for you  
alright  
see  
yeah  
it is a circle  
mhm  
look at that  you have green and orange  
those are the colors of 
of uh 
 
can I show you something  
I'm gonna put a bunch of circles together and I'm gonna make a square  
yes  
oh  boy  
oh yeah  you can fill it in  
that's a good idea  
mm  
you want orange  
you can do it  
I'm gonna be right back  I'm gonna go get a face cloth  
oh well  you know what  
oh y 
yeah  I probably should've put one on now  
but um 
here  go ahead  
this isn't really any useful  
the thing to do right is it  
yeah  we'll put something on to protect your clothes  
we can set your easel and put something underneath it  and you guys  you could fingerpaint  
that might be  fun thing for you to do  
okay  so we can get you fingerpaint  
now that you've colored them  
okay

you know why  
you don't lean on that  
let go  
I'm taking your stuff out of there  
I don't want you leaning on that  okay  
it's not safe  
it's glass and it's not meant to be leaned on  
and if something broke  every 
okay  
you're just a donkey  
that's right  
alright  bud  
you can have breakfast  
what would you like  would  would you like me to make you some hot cereal  
would you like some oatmeal  
yeah  would you like oatmeal  or would you like the kind I made you yesterday  
I'll get you the green bowl  
you're welcome  
would you like oatmeal in there  
oatmeal with raisins  
alright  
well  that it is cereal  
that's a type of hot cereal  
okay  
what kind of cereal would you like  
what kind of cereal would you like  
do you want the kind a made you yest

no  we're gonna have cereal at the 
would you want this one  
this one  
this one  
okay  this one  
this one  
okay  
I'm gonna get you milk  see that  
that's why I opened up the refrigerator  
milk  
that's your vanilla milk  yes  it is  
here's the deal  the reason why I usually give you the other bowl 
William  I'm talking to you  
I'm talking to you  
I think I'm gonna give you a different bowl for this  
okay  
and it'll make it a little bit more difficult for you to eat 
out of  
this one is a better bowl for you  
because when you scoop it out 
it'll stay  
cause it's heavier  
you see  
yeah  see i 
we're not gonna play with that  we aren't gonna put it on our head  
you like those  
yes  would you like some milk  
is that enough milk

you're welcome  
 
sounds like an airplane  
oh  I don't know  I don't know if a truck sounds like that  
it sounds a little smooth 
maybe  
but  I don't think there's a snow on the ground  
is there  
did it snow  
it did  
oh  
you know what 
I think I'm gonna move you in  
 it's a little difficult when you 
it's on your foot  uh  
you did  you got milk on your foot  didn't you  
yeah  
is that better  
like this
