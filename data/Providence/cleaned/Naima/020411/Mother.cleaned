why don't you think I'm recording Naima 
is that a reason 
oh okay 
um today is Friday the twenty fifth 
and you can see yourself when it's done you can't see yourself now 
um so 
we're about 
and have switched 
batteries in the receiver and one of the transmitters 
I see more bear food here 
would you like yogurt to have with those almonds 
how bout some Oatios 
how bout some Kamut cake 
how bout some cheese 
I think bears do like cheese especially bear 
I think bears do like cheese especially bear cubs 
where's the cheese here it is 
oh what a r a w r i n g bear 
that's quite a r a w r Naima 
doesn't like the bear food 
why doesn't the bear like the bear food 
what that's cheese you like cheese 
a smaller piece 
dyou say the bear's tummy would like a smaller piece 
 
here put that cheese down I'll cut that too 
put it down I'll cut it 
 
very funny 
very funny 
it's a cheese square 
what 
that's the shape of a curve oh that piece of cheese 
let's see 
yeah it does have a curve you're right 
it doesn't rock well blocks that are curved can rock cheese that is curved probably won't rock as well 
here's the crackers 
you rearranging your cheese 
you straightening up 
 
hm 
are you making a little sandwich 
 is it a sunny day today 
what kind of a day is it 
hm it's a Mommy day 
are you sure it's not a Naima day 
it's a lovely Naima day today 
mhm I bet would love to take you to the playground today 
well maybe 
well you need to make sure you have lunch before you have icecream 
besides are you gonna go shopping with and buy the eggs 
but I need you to buy eggs 
why not 
that would be very helpful for Mommy 
don't you like helping Mommy 
no usually you do like helping 
you joking 
I thought so 
r a w r 
you could be the only bear in the store if you go to the store 
you could bring Grizzly to the store and put him next to you in the wagon 
and Griz could ride in the car too 
and Griz could wear the booties 
and you could even carry him in the backpack in the store if you want 
go with and buy the eggs and show Griz where the eggs are in the store 
I bet he doesn't know cause he's a little bear 
yup you know and you could show him 
you could show him what things a store has 
I don't think Griz has I think maybe Sleepy Bear's been to the store with you but I don't think Griz has been to the store 
Sleepy's a big bear 
oh he can buy things 
who are we talking about now 
mhm 
why do I think you should have lunch before icecream 
cause icecream is a treat 
it's a little bit special 
and you need to make sure you have things with protein before you eat icecream 
it's just a rule 
it is a rule 
don't spill that please 
well please don't take it out that's gonna make a 
Naima 
are you making a mess I'm gonna take this away from you 
well then stop making the mess good

it's apple 
that's a funny looking apple 
it looks just like almonds 
ground up almonds 
you're telling me that's an apple 
that's a weird looking apple 
what a weird looking apple 
cause apples are red and round 
and that is not red

gasoline 
what's gasoline for Naima 
for Mister Frumble does he get gasoline 
oh really 
she does cut his tie by accident that's right 
I think because he's oh you mean does he do that when he's shaving no that's when he's getting a haircut isn't it 
I think the barber cuts his tie by accident 
oh because Mister Frumble is hm moving around too much when you get your hair cut you're not supposed to move around too much
