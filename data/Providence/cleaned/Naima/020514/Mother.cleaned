 wanna try again or you want me to try it for you 
today is Thursday August 
twenty eighth 
you're making a big tower there 
 
a tower with candles on top 
wow 
who's the tower for 
m u m b u d y 
who's m u m b u d y 
and a what 
a lick full of homes 
wow 
look at that 
that's a big big tower 
look at that 
it's s c l a i m i n g 
I guess you do but I don't 
is that a word you made up 
what does it mean 
it clicks up 
that's what s c l a i m i n g means 
you mean when the legos click together 
hm 
d'you want me to hold that 
kay 
see that's making it not fit 
I guess it does actually fit 
it might fall over though 
what a beautiful 
what a beautiful 
what is it 
oh what a beautiful tower 
you need to do what 
is that another word you made up 
oh 
what does it mean 
his back home cave 
mm 
 
oop 
 you upset that that fell 
you want something to put the tree on 
whoop 
that's because that's in the way 
here 
okay 
yeah 
mm 
you know I think we need to stabilize it 
like that 
you can put things on there 
there 
and I bet this would also stabilize it if we put this right here 
then it won't fall so easily 
you wanna put it on top of this 
okay 
he's gonna be so happy 
it's so nice when someone gives you a present 
sometimes people give presents on birthdays or holidays but sometimes people give each other presents just 'cause they want to 
mm look Sleepy Naima made you a present 
you're gonna what it 
is that another new word 
what does that mean 
b a b i l i z e 
oh you mean stabilize it 
 
look Sleepy Naima made you a tower 
this blackberry bush 
oh yep that's a good idea 
yeah you could put that one up there 
how about if we made one that was a little more stable and it wouldn't fall down as easily 
wait a m 
we can still make it tall 
it 
they can't really go next to each other 
I think you hafta put it on top 
for it to fit 
 
what a nice tree 
it looks just like a tree 
is it a tree tower 
it's gonna what 
butter mill 
hm 
what what does butter milling mean 
what does b w e e l e e l e e mean 
b w e e l e e l e e 
Sleepy Bear wants to know what that means 
b w e e l e e l e e 
he used to say those things when he 
oh you're using those words 
is he saying thank you 
mm 
he is 
when you're first making it 
want me to stabilize it 
is that what Sleepy Bear's saying 
 looks like he's looking at it and he likes it 
pajama pajama pajama 
this tower has a snail on it 
hey what are you doing there 
bring that back 
you were trying take it off 
why 
excuse me 
Naima you took off 
socket 
why did you do that 
okay 
you don't know why you did 
you want some breakfast 
do you wanna eat pancakes 
with blueberries inside them 
oh really 
I didn't realize that 
oh well Naima could have just pancakes with the blueberries in them and eat them like muffins 
the ones that are from yesterday 
that are in the fridge 
do you want to have some yogurt 
the StitchtaBear is l o o f i n g 
he's what 
p a j u m m i n g 
you hit the ball and the panda bear throws it to Sleepy Bear 
budging up 
he's watching what 
he pinches his mommy 
he's pinching you I see that now 
you could say 
'cause if he's a toddler bear he needs to learn what the rules are and how to be with people like you don't pinch people and you don't hit people 
what're you gonna tell him 
right you still can say it in a nice way but he still needs to learn 
oh no 
you don't wanna hurt your bear 
sounds like the b 
Saint Stephen is gotten very slowed down 
did you read this article 
it's 
I bet since 
was it after nine eleven 
it wasn't it was before 
I have a feeling it's really 
the bear's in the chair 
are you in the chair 
the backpack and I'm gonna find your kiwi and then I'm gonna slice it so my hands are gonna actually be fairly busy 
do you wanna sit here at this table Naima 
you're stabilizing those towers 
it does 
okay 
oh a very you mean 
well to come this far up most people will wanna spend more than a weekend 
mhm 
mhm 
where's that 
maybe Daddy can help you 
you mean steak like what the bear eats in that book that kind of steak 
hm 
what 
well there are a number that are huge like that I mean 
yeah no I've seen sleeps 
I thought Daddy said he was gonna sit with you 
what do you want me to do 
can I help 
can I make a suggestion 
you don't wanna hear my idea 
alright then I won't tell you my idea 
you don't need to hear what you think 
because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego 
see how this is wider 
if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable 
see this is wider and this is skinny and narrow 
if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable 
yeah even that is better 
that if I were you I'd put that on the bottom 
'cause that's really stable that's like a platform 
it's a pretty big tower though 
and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand that also helps 
to keep it more stable 
shall we have a civilized breakfast together 
do you wanna have breakfast together 
 
she needs to p u n g it back Daddy 
how 'bout if we stabilize it by putting it on that 
you don't think so 
you hold it 
see 
'cause it's sort of uneven 
things would be more stable on that floor which is much more flat 
see this is an uneven floor 
well I meant this kind of 
we'll put this up here 
what's who gonna try and do 
oh 
she's making these as presents for Sleepy Bear 
he's a lucky bear 
here's some kiwi 
oh you're right there's hardly any syrup 
do we have a syrup mouse in the house 
well I think it's enough for us to split that last pancake that was from yesterday 
and then we can have toast also 
I mean since we're 
half used food things 
oh the chair is there 
her special puffin place mat is up there 
okay 
yeah 
okay this is just barely warm but 
Naima do you want some pancake too 
yeah 
it's right here 
it's like a blueberry muffin that's what I thought 
is it also like a muffin shape 
hm 
you wanna split this with me 
I think there's enough syrup for this 
hm 
oh 
 
what 
it says that 
 you trying to find the most expensive 
here have your pancake 
do you want some soy milk or skim milk 
yes I saw the fly 
mhm that would be fun 
is it good 
it's all gone I'm sorry 
you could have a baby yogurt 
mhm 
I'm gonna go fiddle with the laundry 
 
uhoh 
this blueberry jam has not been refrigerated 
I guess but I'm gonna put it in the fridge now 
um what was I thinking 
we should try to visit the organic blueberry farm down the road 
is it on 
because otherwise we should call Gramps' 
and give them a little headsup 
if we're gonna do that 
yeah 
well and I wonder if they're at the Blue Hill Fair 
marketing or anything 
which starts tonight actually as far as I can tell 
so 
the proble 
to 
uh yeah but I think that trip to the Blue Hill Fair would be uh 
'cause we're gonna be under a lot of pressure to get 
yeah 
is that a reasonable stop 
okay well 
is that a good breakfast Naima 
yeah 
it's good 
not overly sweet 
we could read that after breakfast 
well I'm not gonna read it 'cause I'm eating my breakfast 
 Sal and her mother take some pails and go to Blueberry Hill don't they 
why do they want to 
that's right 
her mother wants to can blueberries for next winter 
that means 
I know it probably sounds like it means put them in cans but it means put them in jars 
like to make jam 
on the stove and put it in jars and then store it keep it so that they will have blueberries all year round 
we do that too except we put the blueberries in the freezer 
so we have them all year round 
almost all year round 
this is the time of year when people who have blueberry fields pick their blueberries 
in fact that's probably a reason why they aren't at the Blue Hill Fair because 'cause it's probably peak time for picking 
or maybe 
oh little Sal finds mother crow and her children 
little bear finds a mother partridge I think you're right 
 
mother 
the mother bear and little bear 
and the mother partridge and the mother crow 
and their children 
I think that's all 
who else 
Little Bear are you eating your blueberries 
gesundheit 
gesundheit gesundheit 
for two sneezes 
oop 
you need your spoon 
I'll wash it 
kiwi seeds 
we could do Cobb's Cook in the afternoon 
I just wanna take a shower before I go out but 
you wanna go on a hike this morning Naima 
you wanna go on a hike with Mommy 
hm 
sour yogurt 
all that 
mhm 
I think you dropped some blueberries out of the spoon 
can you pick up the ones that're on the mat now and put them 
Naima you know what you're doing now 
you're making a mess 
and that goes for these over here too 
these ones 
good 
over here 
thank you for cleaning up those blueberries now you can eat them 
in fact 
yeah that's where we're gonna do our hiking 
we can be bears 
in the woods 
I wonder if I should bring the backpack 
it's a little hard to do it if 
you would like to hike on your own just walking wouldn't you 
that was a nice hike we did 
is something in your mouth 
blueberry skin 
oh is that the first time you're having the honey 
 where we used to get crystallized honey all the time 
yep 
 be nice to maybe bring back home some blueberry honey 
we could maybe get a bigger thing or some more 
I think I got that in Eastport 
but there must be 
y'know 
 must be all over 
what did you say Naima about Blueberries For Sal 
oh 
k a p l i n k k a p l a n k k e r p l u n k
