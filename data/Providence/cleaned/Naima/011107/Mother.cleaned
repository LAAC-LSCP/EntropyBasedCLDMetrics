I've heard about this book 
if you give a pig a pancake 
that pig is climbing in the kitchen door 
about to eat a pancake 
I think that means maple syrup right 
you'll give her some of your favorite maple syrup 
she'll probably get all sticky 
oh look at that little pig 
she's all sticky 
that's like when when you drink Motrin or Tylenol and it spills and it gets very sticky 
it's so she wants to take a bath 
ah because she's all sticky 
she'll ask you for some bubbles 
that pig wants to have a bath with bubbles 
when you give her the bubbles she'll probably ask you for a toy 
you'll hafta find your rubber duck 
that girl is finding the rubber duck to give it to the pig who's taking a bath with bubbles in the bath tub 
the duck will remind her of the farm where she was born she might feel homesick and want to visit her family she want you to come too she look through your closet for a suitcase 
then she'll look under your bed when she's under the bed she'll find your old tap shoes 
she'll try them on she'll probably need something special to wear them with that pig is making a mess 
when she's all dressed she'll ask for some music 
then she wants you to take her piture 
otherwise known as a picture 
look at that dancing pig 
so you'll hafta get your camera 
and she sees the picture she'll ask you to take more she wants to send one to each of her friends she wants all those photographs 
you hafta give her some envelopes and stamps 
on the way and take her to the mail box 
oh they're going with a wheelbarrow full of mail to the mailbox 
on the way she'll see a tree in your back yard she'll want to build a tree house ah 
a tree house is a house up in the trees 
there's a hammer and nails and there's lotsof wood here 
when the tree house is finished 
she'll ask for a wall paper and glue 
when she hangs the wall paper she'll get all sticky 
feeling sticky will remind her of your favorite maple syrup she'll probably ask for some 
and chances are if she ask you for some syrup she'll want a pancake to go with it 
there's the pig 
if you give a pig a pancake 
here piggy 
she wants some maple syrup to go with it 
you'll give her some of your favorite maple syrup
