the 
should we go get that 
to clip it on you so you can wear it 
you just wanna eat grapes 
I'm gonna give you the grapes over here 
find what 
you already found them 
you can have them out of this bowl if you want 
I'm gonna put this here okay 
are they good grapes 
that's good 
cause it's a transmitter 
without having it bother you 
to wear it and put the transmitter in it 
you could carry Olivia and the transmitter in it 
well um you know Amanda and Katherine sent us that for the transmitter but I think they wouldn't mind if Olivia also rides in it 
Olivia might actually enjoy riding on top of the transmitter 
what do you think 
she could stand on top of it in the little pouch 
but we'll we'll get that in a little bit 
you could put rags away for me in a minute too 
that's fine you can just eat 
it's fine 
um what am I doing 
I'm making s a a gund which means I hafta wash a big bowl full of 
mustard greens 
that kind of a vegetable is called mustard greens 
hanging in the bag there 
that's what that is 
well I need to put it in a lot of water to wash it really nicely 
to make sure that the mustard greens get very clean cause we're going to cook them and eat them 
cause they don't taste very good if you don't cook them 
I think they're kind of bitter 
I think you have tasted something bitter but I'm trying to think of what it was 
you know what you had that was a little bit bitter 
do you remember once I think you ate some b r i efra cheese 
when we went to Prodigal Son in Hyannis 
and Mommy got some b r i efra cheese and some fruit on a plate to eat 
I think that you tried it and I think you actually liked it 
well I don't really want this shirt to get messy cause this is a shirt that I like 
and I'm gonna do some cooking 
adjust this a bit 
so we're just about a week out from last time we taped 
do you remember that 
he likes to go there to get coffee sometimes 
he likes their coffee the way they make coffee there 
 he just does I think 
I think he thinks it has a good flavor 
I think he thinks the coffee that they make at Prodigal Son has a good flavor 
well you'd hafta ask Daddy 
he's the one who knows why 
okay you asked me what bitter is right 
the flavor of that is bitter 
actually it's also spicy so you might not like it 
those are spicy greens 
ooh we're gonna have spicy food tonight 
do you like spicy food 
do you think Mommy likes it 
a little what of paprika 
I don't know where you got that word from 
cause we're gonna make s a a gund which is a very nice spicy dish and we're gonna have spicy fish too 
spicy nag

uhhuh

oh which stool 
that one with the blue 
mhm

did you hear me leave that message for his mommy 
when we were in the car

I didn't say yes I said maybe 
because I need to talk to her about it first and that's only if it's not

bitter is the name for that kind of flavor 
do you want a couple letter cookies to eat 
kay 
let's see 
the letter of the day 
and here's a word I can spell with it 
that's a word 
spells toy 
I'm gonna write toy down here on our list 
and table 
okay let's see 
we're cooking these mustard greens 
mustard 
cozy 
what's what for 
that's like a joke 
Tozy 
I guess that means the word toes 
yes 
just a minute 
Mommy needs her recipe 
 it's a bitter taste 
isn't it 
in a minute 
are you going to eat any of those cookies 
boys and toys 
o y s and do y s 
I think you're right 
no that's not what it spells 
it spells t y 
it spells o t y 
it just spells o t y 
well then you'd need an s and I don't have an s here 
I don't have an s here 
there's no s here yet 
there seems to be no s in this bag of cookies 
actually I don't see one yet 
oh I found an s 
now it spells 
ah okay 
it spells y s 
whoop jeez 
the t has to be the first letter 
what you have there 
o 
you need o to be next 
o and then y 
and then s 
and now it spells toys 
o y s 
it spells e e zp 
you can't tell me what it spells 
babe 
mhm 
it's very delicious with ginger 
okay wuf that's hot 
yeah that's mustard greens 
uh yes that's mustard greens 
let's see 
t s o spells t s o 
t s o 
so there 
well it's just kind of a mean thing to say that's all 
well I think you're eating the y 
 
who are you and why are you so white 
mm it's a good question 
it's a good question 
do I look a little bit like a polar bear 
wearing an apron like this 
I guess I must 
I have an idea about what's scary 
 
what could it be then 
oh brother 
you've had it before 
it's the same kind you had the other day 
I think you liked it 
it's salty but I think you liked it 
cause you ate it 
that's how I could tell 
um it actually has salt in it 
smoked salmon 
using some salt 
and some smoke I think 
watch out cause I'm gonna use this 
it's the Cuisinart noise 
mm kay 
I'm done doing that 
sag 
you're 
okay 
you can let me know when you're done 
oh 
do you want to get down play in the livingroom or do you want me to give you something fun to do here 
okay 
uh just a minute 
he did what 
he fixed the toast tongs 
oh 
I'm gonna give you another muffin tin to put them into 
or you could actually put them into the icecube tray 
in fact you could do 
are they too big for that container 
okay 
mm okay I think you're right 
we'll take these out 
I think we have a muffin tin that has twelve 
yeah 
I'm gonna give you this big muffin tin 
because this has got twelve 
and the icecube tray also has tw 
 that has a different number actually 
you can just put them wherever you want okay 
these are different kinds of nuts 
you can practice putting them in there 
whoops 
whoops whoops whoops okay 
 
there you can take them out with your fingers 
that's another walnut 
that's an almond 
actually you know I'm not sure 
but I'm not positive about that 
I think that's a hazel nut 
there are lotsof different kinds of nuts 
just a second 
I think that's a hazel nut 
I think that's another hazel nut 
the icecube tray has more than twelve and the muffin tin has twelve places for twelve muffins 
and I need some salt 
just a second honey 
let me see 
I don't remember 
usually when I buy nuts they already have the shells taken off of them 
let's see 
you're right it is 
you have matching 
why don't you put all the nuts that match in one container and all the nuts that look alike with the dark brown in that container 
no I mean you put all the ones that like like this in here put all the ones that look like that 
I see 
 if you want to do that 
but a bird or let's see some other kind of animal with strong teeth could probably do it 
cause I don't know everything and I don't know everything about every kind of bird 
I only know some things about some kinds of birds 
I think chickadees do eat insects 
if I'm not mistaken 
do you wanna take the nuts and play with them down on the floor 
um do you wanna help make cookies 
okay 
let's see to do that you will need definitely to wash hands 
I think we'll save them in a good 
let's put all the nuts in a yogurt container 
why don't you put them all in there and then 
and then I will help you put the top on it 
yeah I think you're right 
Mommy does too 
cause it makes the food taste good 
whoa 
you made a musical instrument 
you want another yogurt container 
you could make two of those musical instruments 
it's like a shaky a shaky yogurt container 
whoops 
here you go 
whoa 
 the top wasn't on 
are you making one or two of these 
here's some more nuts 
let me see this 
there try that 
you know what it sounds a little different every time you put more or less nuts in it 
that one will sound empty I bet 
 but you know what might sound different if you put something really small in there like some of your beans 
let's put beans in one of them and see what it sounds like 
and close it close it up real tight 
there 
that does sound different 
the nuts 
nuts 
who says nuts 
what did I put in here 
cornmeal 
whoop 
oh this mixing bowl is very heavy 
mixer I mean 
mm 
where's the butter that I just had in my hand 
where's my butter 
I've lost my butter 
lost my butter 
what shall I do 
oh my god I'm glad I got that on tape 
it's for cooking with 
uh well let's see 
alright 
when we make the cookie dough 
but we need to make the dough first 
oh 
okay you're gonna need to pick 
I'll help you get down 
and you need to put them away or play with them in the livingroom 
I don't want them on the floor there 
I'm gonna count to ten then you're gonna pick up the ones that are on the floor 
do you need help getting down 
and then I'll give you the top after you collect all your nuts 
you're collecting nuts just like a squirrel does 
and then I will let you help me make the cookies if you would like to 
you're doing a good job picking those up Naima 
and there's some up on the table too 
wanna get those 
you want me to help put that on then you could shake it 
I guess we're gonna turn off the tape
