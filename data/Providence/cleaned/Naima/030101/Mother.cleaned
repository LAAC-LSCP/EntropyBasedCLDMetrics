are you giving me a present  
yes  
I see that  
presents to plant  
that's a nice kind of present  
thank you  
it's alright with me if you want to take the seeds out of that seed packet and put them in envelopes  
that would be fine  
while I'm sorting these seeds 
today is Sunday 
you can do that if you want and put them in here if you feel like it  
or just put them in here  
did we say what was the date today  
do you remember  
was it the seventeenth or the eighteenth  
cause you looked at it on the calendar and so did I  
the different color  
okay  signet marigold  
those are big seeds  
they're easy to find  
sow indoors  
lightly cover seed  
harden often  
okay  
we will plant some of these and those today too  
fever fuel  
the ones that you have  
right there  those brown ones  
you can take them  
 
you can do that  
you well we can plant them when it's time to plant them  
you know those zinnias that we planted last year never came up  
here's the package of seeds from the zinnias  
that was kind of disappointing  
what was funny  
I know  
sow seeds outdoors in early spring  
maybe we should 
I think we might need to go to the garden store to get some flats to put our seedlings in  
we have some containers but we don't 
whoopsie  
we don't quite have enough  
this is parsley  
 
direct sunlight  
this is Nasturtiums  
and basically empty  
carrots  
yeah I think you're right  
I know  
I don't think so  
I've always had trouble growing carrots  
I don't know if it's because of the soil  
it's not the right kind of soil or what  
these need to be planted in June  
or July  
what does it look like  
s it look the same  
it doesn't look any different at all  
aw  
oh dear  
oh  Calendula  
orange zinger  
those never came up either  
they 
actually we got plants but they didn't bloom  
that's what happened  
direct seed after last frost  
okay it goes in that category  
and this is the chard  
blooms during mid spring  
to mid summer  
the Cal 
well the 
zinnias never came up  
 
after all danger of frosts has past  
yes Naima  
does it look the same  
what does it look like  
can you put these things in the garbage for me  
those that's garbage there  
an this too  
sorry there was more  
 
 
okay here's all the different categories of seeds  
these things we hafta wait until we have our garden built  
actually that has gotta go elsewhere  
okay  
there  
and this has gotta go 
direct seed after last frost  
you have two kinds of bean seeds is that right  
well that's what 
that's all I'm gonna give you right now because we're getting ready 
to go investigate the problem with the grow core  
plant outdoors today  
cause we need some flats to sow seeds in  
okay  
 
 
oh  not only is it looking 
not different  
I'm gonna take this 
out  
I think 
possibly 
it's not fluffing up  
I don't know let's sit here a while longer  
I do not know why this is happening  
but I think maybe we shouldn't have put the stuff on top of it to weight it down  
let's leave it like this  
I'm gonna leave it here a while longer  
now I think 
'm a go to the garden store and get some flats  
to grow things in  
no no  
I want you to leave it right there  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Naima  
no no no  
can you tell me what you want it for  
I don't want you to touch the grow core  
I want it to stay there and I want it to work  
so we hafta leave it alone so that it will work  
hee hee hee  
alright  
let's go to the garden store  
want some yogurt with berries  
ah  
sounds like a good idea  
and do some kinda work while I'm doing that  
just yogurt with berries  
okay  
 
oh  
 
this door  
oh Naima did that come out  
I'll fix that  
I shut this door by accident  
and I shut it too far and now I can't get it to open  
 
probably Daddy can fix it  
I just hafta get Daddy to come upstairs and help fix the door first  
or maybe even we left them at the vacation house  
I think  
that's possible  
 
cause I can't 
I haven't seen them in our house for a while  
so I 
we should ask Babaji and Dadaji if we left them there  
either that or they're in one of the cooler bags  
or could be in Mommy's purse even  
oh  I didn't even get you your food yet  
and find 
the missing spoons  
that they might be able to find them  
I'm gonna bury the berries  
I'm gonna bury them in yogurt  
there you go  
there you go  
know why it wasn't working anyway  
there now it should be working  
I'm gonna play it back and see what happens  
cept I have  put it on something a little higher  
I don't know why it wasn't working  
yes  
you're not sick  
more berries dear  
 
I don't think we have any canoe berries  
I don't think we have any canoe berries  
I know you are  
look  
no  
gone  
they're all gone  
oh brother  
oh  
yes  
what's happening  
what's what  
I'm not worried about it not making noise  
mm  
are you talking about the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History  
or the one in Wellfleet  
um  I don't think I've taken Naima there  
Naima you should have breakfast in a little while  
there's fromage and there's muffins  
yeah  
I did  
oh  
yes  
let Grandma take them away  
Naima you might wanna give Grandma a little break so she can have some breakfast  
okay good  
yogurt  porridge  muffins  
you too Naima  
why don't you try the muffin  
if you want you could also have 
gonna have a foot operation  
did you know that  
it's alright  
you don't always hafta tell people  
oh  
no no it spilled out  
you hafta pay attention to where your food goes or you're gonna lose it  
you lost a whole bunch of fromage here  
yeah  
I did actually take a look at it  
but I don't think I'd know  
know of them making gardens  
so are 
actually are you thinking of coming up  
oh  maybe so  
uh  
oh yeah  the 
yeah  
I guess so  
yeah  I think we would be back  
maybe  
maybe  
you don't hafta eat it then  
it's alright  
oh is that the weekend  
I did not sure which town it was  
oh wait yeah  
hm  
Naima what else would you like  
did you like the muffin  
yeah  
that means it's blooming  
Naima do you want some scrambled egg  
what  
you are gonna be okay  
 you want some fresh pear  
Naima decided she liked skin  
pear skin  
 get you some  
they do  
bears love pear skin  
Klar the Bar  
Mom would you like some pear  
which she rejected  
no  
these are 
last month  
organic  
the ones on Cape Cod aren't usually organic  
not 
it doesn't it doesn't work because of 
because of fungi and 
uh those some diseases  
more so even than pests  but 
I know people that have terrible trouble growing apples  
and even people who 
the one guy I know who used to grow apples organically switched over to 
using some kind of te 
chemical because it was just impossible  
here  
and even in Massachusetts I don't think there's any certified organic apples  
uh you know has an apple tree  
or maybe she does  
hm  
she doesn't 
I think 
I don't know if she actually sells them  
Naima do you still wanna have your hair cut today  
okay  
do you wanna do it while Grandma still here  
okay  
eight forty  
maybe Grandma could read you a book while I cut your hair so that your head will stay still  
what do you think  
why  
cause you can't move your head when you're getting a haircut because the scissors could 
hurt your neck a little bit  
 
and how old is he  
oh brother  
but clo 
maybe close  
and she's older than you  right  
mm  
Naima do you want a piece of cheese to eat  
for some protein  
we don't have any m a n c h e g ospa cheese  
we have cheddar cheese  
um  
there's kippers  
do you want some kippers  
or mackerel  
yeah  
I haven't been able to find the mackerel yet  
let me finish looking for the mackerel  
Naima did have macaroni and cheese the other day  
mhm  
that was a good thing to have for breakfast since it did have protein  
or maybe we used up the mackerel  
let me just see  
I don't know this is taking 
you can start on the mackerel while I heat up the macaroni and cheese  
uh oh  Naima  guess what  
there isn't any macaroni and cheese  
we used it up  
when you ate it for breakfast the other day that was the last one  
I could make some for you though on the stove  
you alright  
sit up straight in your chair  
that'll probably help  
you have a strong gag reflex  
you're alright  
you're really gonna be okay  
nope you're not gonna do anything  
you're gonna be fine  
you're gonna be fine  
do you want some water to drink  
kay  
oh it's hiding  
 
do you wanna pour your own water this morning  
well actually it's smoked up at that farm  
I think Whole Foods  
okay  I guess now I finish making macaroni and cheese  
some of the what  
what  
yes  
I've got some and I'm gonna make cheese sauce to go on it  
what's that  
no I'm not gonna go away  
do you need a tissue for your nose  
are you done with the water  
kay  we don't play with 
nope  
including your water  
gonna wipe your hands on that  
there  
clean up the water that spilled  
 
uh Mom are you 
I don't feel like I've quite offered you enough  
you know there's some 
there's some low fat cottage cheese  
um  
bagel  
yogurt  
apple  
chow chickadee  
what's a chow chickadee  
that's a very good question  
I think a female bluejay 
either looks exactly like a male bluejay or is a li 
doesn't have quite as bright a color blue  
but you know what  
you can't really tell them apart  
 
to the feeder  
 you wanna eat that  
that's right  
hm  
was it last week Naima  
I think it was  
well some time last week  
lemme get your fork Naima  
a fork will help you eat it without getting your fingers messy and hurting your booboo  
it's not too hot  
kinda cool actually  
cause the pasta was cold even though the sauce was hot  
what do you think  
the  
I'll put some on then you stir it up with your fork okay  
the sauce is pretty hot  
it's got cheddar cheese in it  
there's a little milk to drink  
Naima you only can have the water if you do not put your spoon or your hand or your fingers into it or any food into it  
it's for drinking only okay  
hm  
do you get cardinals on your porch  
mhm  
 
they are  
really  
blue jays probably scare cardinals  
oh there's a very big bird  
well they come very frequently  
the cardinals do  
 always have a lot  
any more than one male at a time  
yes  
you want tomato sauce  
I will get you some  
yeah  
 
I'll get some more out of the basement  
this is the kind that you like  
well  
you want it on plain pasta  
I'm sorry you didn't like that  
when I said  it's still nighttime it's not morning yet  you said  no no it's morning  
and I said it's not morning  
do you mind if this is cold or do you want me to heat it up  
 you want it heated up  
you want it cold  
both the pasta and sauce cold  
hm  
hm  
usually I warm up the pasta and give you cold sauce but we could do the opposite  
now that one  
it's a new restaurant  
maybe I can ask Grandma to grate some cheese for you  
grate it right into this bowl  
did you give me those bowls  
 
yeah  
so if you come 
in June would that be like a long weekend  
that last weekend of June  
and Bill would come too right  
kay  
oh I know why I was confused cause we actually don't come back until that Tuesday  
we're gonna get here  
we have vaca 
he 
cause has that Monday off  
and then Tuesday is his regular day off  
so we have full 
although we might be back actually earlier  
yep  
 you want me to 
 
 
 
it was up there in the tree but I can't see it now  
it's very 
oh look there's a cherry tree in bloom right there  
I didn't notice that before  
yeah  
magnolias have big big blossoms  
magnolias up in Providence it's gorgeous  
cause it 
and 
I think they don't grow well here or something but  
they're just 
is it listening to what you're telling it  
no  
right it's not red  
I'll leave the grater out  
and take this away  
Cape Cod 
humidity  insects  
 
oh  
oh I think that's cause that doesn't get used very much  
so they set up home there  
cause I don't think they have the s 
 you count the number of legs it's not eight legs  
 
where did I um 
take the train when I came with Naima and got picked up by you  
no I mean cause I 
oh maybe I'm thinking of where you took me  
and that was after I'd been in New York  
or before  
let me think now  
and that means that I 
you picked me up in S 
no wait  
no cause I think 
the commuter rail  
from in New York I got on the train to Brewster  
I'm pretty sure  
which means that when you picked me up the first time 
no wait  
but 
I'm really confused  
you did  
yeah  
and then I s 
yeah and then I stayed with you and then you took me to the Stamford 
to go home  
but I'm talking about the time we visited Grandma at her house when you were a baby  
we have pictures of that  
she did stay at our house when you were a baby also but I'm talking about her house now cause we took the train there  
right  
for this no I can put it down  
 
no I was just thinking Mom if I were to do that again 
um I would go to Stamford and you would pick me up at Stamford  
that's what I mean if I were to come from here 
and how far is Stamford from you  
well I would do that maybe some time  
just had the usual presentation of six different meals to her highness  
huh  
this is the last of the pasta  
when this is gone there's no more and I'm not gonna make more  
it's her real birthday  
I mean it's sort of peripheral things yes but the sort of issues  
 
why  
why  
why that means there's still a book 
if it's trenchant  
well it's not 
it's not clear to me that 
take your feet off the wall  
 
mm  
I'm not even gonna tell you cause you already know  
I've told you all the things that aren't allowed  
there's some more pear if you want  
that cheese sauce is pretty nice  
she's gonna go byebye  
yep  
so have you  
alright  
uh  
gotta 
look for times
