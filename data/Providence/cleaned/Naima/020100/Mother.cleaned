I'll bring this over here 
you wanna help me pick it up 
okay now it's time to clean up the sentences game 
why don't you pick up the pieces and put them in the 
box for the sentences game 
yup these are the pieces here's an a 
we made three sentences before supper upper class Daddy 
mm I said that we would come have supper after we made three sentences 
that was our deal 
but those sentences are still on the floor in Naima's room 
she didn't want to come in to have supper 
there's a baby 
they were good sentences 
it's a it's a grinder 
yeah 
hero is like everywhere else 
er let's 
sub 
oh right 
I don't remember 
another sub 
hoagie 
chai hoagie 
um I'm gonna eat my stuff 
uh 
this is actually 
this is very silly because 
I need to uh 
there were 
where were we today where there were three oh Dolce had three clocks 
what did we do at Dolce 
tell Daddy what we did 
oh I know 
I think so 
she said something like 
um she was gonna make tea and c h u m c h u mund 
I didn't make that up 
let's see it's seven thirteen so I mean 
I'll find it for you 
those are the seeds 
here it is 
here it is Naima 
you know what's in here 
a boy sleeping 
but Mommy's goin to eat some more supper cause didn't get to eat mine and I'm heating it up again 
oh I think Daddy's reading it Naima 
oh you think I'm recording it so you can see yourself 
yeah you could see yourself afterwards 
I think you need some juice so that you can swallow that waffle 
yeah 
do you want cow's milk or do you want juice 
okay 
today is April fifteenth 
let's see those are dirty dishes we need a juice cup for you 
what a big girl eating waffle like that 
are you a big girl 
what's the name of the book we were reading this morning dya remember 
little FarmerJoe 
what happens in that book 
dya want me to tell you 
yes at the beginning of the book it was dark when Joe arrived at the farm 
think that's right here's some pear and applesauce 
I mean pear and raspberry sauce 
an' Joe wakes up an' what does he who does he meet 
who does he see at the farm 
and Uncle 
who else 
Uncle Will yeah 
I think I'll make some scrambled eggs would you like to eat eggs 
you okay 
is that the juice too sweet 
that juice is a little bit sweet I think 
is that the problem 
I'll get you some plain yogurt and then I'm gonna make the eggs 
um where's the yogurt 
I think it's hiding in this refrigerator 
that'll help it be less sweet 
shall I put some yogurt in this bowl 
I figured as much 
you know it's okay to eat more than one thing out of a single bowl Naima 
uh Mommy's waffles are almost ready do you want any more waffle 
let's see did I not I did not get out the eggs 
there that should be a lot less sweet 
you're mixing that's great 
I'm gonna scramble some eggs now 
I need a bowl to mix the eggs in and then I need a pan to fry the eggs in 
frying means when you put food in a pan on the stove with some oil or butter and the food cooks in the in the hot oil or the hot butter 
frying is different from boiling boiling means when water gets very hot 
let's see how do I explain this 
when water gets very hot an' it starts to make bubbles because it's so hot then it's boiling 
and sometimes you can cook food in boiling water or you can just make tea or coffee with boiling water 
cooking things in water is called boiling them 
cooking things in oil or butter is called frying them 
what am I doing 
what am I doing 
you're looking at me scrambling the eggs yeah 
now I'm gonna put some oil in the pan because I'm gonna fry the eggs 
and I'm going to put a little bit of salt in the eggs 
n' when I fry when I make scrambled eggs I also need a metal spatula 
this is the frying pan this is a metal spatula 
hm I wonder what the birds are eating for breakfast
