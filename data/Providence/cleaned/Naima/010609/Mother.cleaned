so just as a little preface this is a very this is very much a transition time for Naima since we've only slept in our new house three nights so far 
although all our stuff has been here longer than that 
goldenrod 
we've noticed Naima using adverbs of time alot more and accurately some of the time like nursie now she says 
or she says it's raining today 
and she likes to say a while ago and she likes to say uh 
I think she says yesterday and she has said tomorrow 
raining tomorrow 
it's raining today actually 
um Mommy carry you she'll say that 
and it's also a transition time cause we're doing lotsof new things and meeting lotsof new people just in the last couple weeks 
we've only been to that twice 
and we're at a different group in the library with the big kids 
and Naima started a swim class with Daddy and there's new kids in that and it's a new thing to do something with Daddy alone like that 
which is a very 
um so all those things are going on
