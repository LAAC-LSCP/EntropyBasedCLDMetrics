a yellow boot and a blue boot  
oh  you mean in that picture  
what's under that flap  
lost and found lady has a computer  
oh  
 
he must be going to eat something inside that lunchbox  
do you think he's gonna open it  
oh  you think he's gonna eat some smoothie  
 
d'you wanna use your potty  
yes  I guess so  
Naima  would you like to use your potty  
not even to put a sticker in it  huh  
you wanna sit on the potty and put some peepee in it and then put the sticker in it  
even better  
let's go  
you don't  
okay  
poopy diaper's got nothing in it  
put something in the potty  
okay  
while you're waiting  
the white one  
you have a blue one also  
a brown cat  
she has a brown cat  
she's sitting on it  
I think she's practicing sitting on it  
what do you do with a potty  
 
wear it on your head  
 
 no  
sit on it  
 yes  
do you know what goes inside  
and poop  of course  
 
I think she is  
and so is the cat  
when I feel it coming I run for the potty  
w o o p h  
I pull down my pants and sit myself down  
then I fill the potty with my very own peepee  
I think you peed  
you could poop too if you want  
you wanna pull down that flap  
she has 
yeah  she has green pants on 
looks like she's pulling them down herself  
yes  
I think she probably is  
are you a big girl too  
then I wipe myself  
that's important because I want to keep my underpants clean and dry  
mm  that's the toilet paper  
then 
someone older  
mhm  
someone 
like a grownup puts the peepee in the toilet  
mhm  
oop  
Mommy will help you with that  okay  
there  
diapers are okay for babies  
there's a baby wearing a diaper  
what's behind the door  
there  
I think that must be the bathroom  
this is the door to the bathroom  
yup  
that's a good question  
you can't see the grownups' potty in this picture  
you don't know  
yes  that's right  
wanna read the other potty book  
cause we need to wipe your bottom  
d'you wanna wait for some poop maybe  
okay  
yeah  
mhm  
okay  
it's in the potty  
that means you get to put another sticker in the book  
let's wipe again  
front  
okay  
you can wear this diaper for a while  
yeah  mostly in case you poop I think cause you just did pee  
yes  you did  
yeah  we hafta go get the stickers  but first 
first thing we're gonna do is pour that in the big potty  
 
can you do it  
without spilling  
good  
oh  good job  
good job 
now 
let me just rinse it out a little bit and then you can flush  
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait  
wait please  
yeah  this belongs here  
okay  you can flush now  
byebye peepee  
now  let's wash hands  
well  it's just that 
it's a good idea to always wash your hands  
after you use the potty  
well 
the thing is  after you use the potty 
you need to wash your hands before you touch anything else  
and then I'll give you some water to drink  
it isn't  
well  we'll be brushing our teeth very soon  
put these up here  
kay  
you like drinking out of that little tiny cup  don't you  
it's really a medicine cup  isn't it  
well it's your water cup now but it's really a medicine cup  
n'kay  
I put a new towel here  
and then 
hey  you did  
just now  
well  that's alright  
we'll just get another clean diaper  
whoops  
sorry about this  
well  Mommy's microphone got knocked out  
I did  
um  let's see 
I think 
what we'll do is we'll leave the potty book there 
we'll go in here 
and we will  um 
we'll get a sticker but we'll get a clean diaper also  
cause if you just peed in this 
oh yeah  it is a little bit wet  
okay  
well  it's just a little bit wet  
I thought y 
just a bit more peepee in you than you realized  
 
putting on the 
 
ohmygoodness  
uhhh  
oh   you putting it on yourself  
what is that stuff  
that's what I'm trying to find out  
well  I'm not sure it was anything really  
it could be something like that  
there wasn't really anything in it  
was just a little white stuff  
I'm not sure what that was  
you think it was pink 
yeah  just a little bit  
so 
let's see  you have a clean diaper 
now you need to 
oh  for goodness sake  
ah  
well  I'm doing a lot of things so my microphone keeps getting jostled  
jostled

uh  
ouch

oh

well  we'll find that part of the potty book where it goes  
right now  
it goes on the number ten cause you've used the potty ten times since we got this book  
woohoo  
good for you  Naima  
well  if you need to poop  you can let me know  
you wanna sit in the big pillow and look at your books  
or you wanna look at the Timothy book

I was so proud of you  
I know you have teeth in there  
you'n do it yourself first  
 
you're very funny  
well then there's no sticker coming  
c'mon  
that's very funny  
I can't believe she said that  
you don't smile with your back teeth  do you  
do you smile with your front teeth or your back teeth  
I think that's right  Naima  
I think that's exactly right  
she called your top teeth your back teeth  
that's very silly  
okay  
ready to have a sip of water  
you did a good job  
letting Mommy brush your teeth is the right thing to do  
and would you like some fluoride  
tonight  
yes  
you don't

Philadelphia chicken  
let's see 
we haven't looked at the dinosaur book for quite a while  
oh  Sam Sheep can't sleep  
hey  you know what I just realized I never do  
we should draw pictures so we can see where we put the different kinds of seeds  
what's on your leg  
  member what that's called  
a base  
now you have a base leg  
let's sit in the big pillow together  
we could spell some things with a pen  
you wanna sit in my lap  
wanna sit in Mommy's lap  
you're thinking of spices  
oh  there's a bass on the big pillow  
let's draw a picture of the garden

look  
I'm gonna draw it in the special garden book  
you wanna read Riddle of Farmer Joe  
okay  
Softie  
Soaftie  
who is Soaftie  
oh  that's the milking parlor  
look at 
you think there are nine  
oh  
wasn't it a clumsy sheep that bumped Joe over  
those are big sheep  
actually I think those sheep are bigger than 
than Joe is  
do you think so  
do you think he misses his own toys at home  
and 
do you think he misses his mom and dad  
yep  there's cows  
riding the horse  
but what's he wearing on his head  
yeah  
I think his mommy and Aunt 
or maybe Aunt Bee is his daddy's sister  
oh  okay  
you're making up a song about nursing  
is that what the song is  
let me take off my microphone and shut everything off and then we'll nurse  
if you need a raisin  I'll go get you a raisin  
but it's actually time to eat supper  so 
you could have some kiwi while I'm making the pasta  
alright  
you need to get in your highchair but I need to 
clean your highchair a little bit first  
please sit 
that's a little bowl of warm water 
that's there because I'm

and which is what I'm going to do right now  
and then you can get in the highchair and eat kiwi while I make the 
yeah  
please  
no standing on that  
if you're gonna use the stool  you hafta sit properly on that  
it's not safe to stand on the edge of it like that  
like you were doing  
kay

your 
oh  yours does too  
Naima  
what did I tell you  
sit on the chair  
you hafta sit on the chair  
it's really not safe to do that  
Naima  
you can't 
when you sit on a stool you really need to sit properly  
so that you don't fall and hurt yourself  
okay  
so that you don't get all wet from it  
cause they were soaking  
they were getting sort of clean  
they were getting soaky  
soaka  
oh

Mommy's gonna cut the kiwi

I'm still peeling the skin off of it  
I'm peeling  peeling  peeling  
mhm  
I'm peeling it  and cutting it  
first I'm peeling it  then I'm cutting it  
I'm giving you a paper plate  
mhm

Baby  
let's see if this was recording properly  
um  today is May first  
and the earlier segment 
ah 
on the tape 
was recorded yesterday  April thirtieth  
and Naima is eating kiwi  
are you a kiwi girl  
are you a kiwi girl 
I knew it  
I just knew it  
there's some tomato sauce  
yes  
and you can have salty cheese also  
Mommy's gonna get the spaghetti  
it's over here  
boy  you're done with that kiwi  
it looks like there's some on the tray still also  
six to eight cups of 
did you have fun today  
good  
what did you have fun doing today  
what did you do  
what did we do together  
yeah  we went somewhere  
center for breast feeding  
yeah  there was a horse there  
can you believe it  
you remember  don't you  
Coco  
okay  I hafta make the pasta first  
yes  I'm gonna give you some of that too  
okay  
I'm gonna reposition you here  
I'm putting the 
y'wanna see what the spaghetti looks like  
before it cooks  
 
yeah  I was showing you what it looks like  
 
yes  
you're gonna have tomato sauce with your pasta  
lemme get some salty cheese out too  
it is cooking  
and you could have carrot too  if you want  
no carrot  
carrot  
no carrot 
and I hafta grate the salty cheese  
but you could snack on this for a little while  
I'm going to grate some 
you don't hafta eat that  
oh you don't hafta  
just sounds like you're hungry  like you need to eat something right away  
hm  
yes honey  
oh  a big yawn  
you had a very short nap today  
you were what where your mommy was  
we're cookin' the pasta  
okay  let's put the timer on  
and 
grate some salty cheese  
I'm gonna grate the salty cheese  
you wanna have a little bit now  
it's very salty  isn't it  
you want some juice or some water  
n'kay  
okay  
is that hurting your mouth  
I was afraid of that  
when you eat salty cheese like that  all by itself  especially if you're really hungry  that can happen  
use both hands please  
good job  
you want juice  
okay  
I'll get you some  
 
very slowly and carefully with that please  
xxx  
okay  I'm gonna get it for you in a minute  
put what back  
uh  I'm gonna talk to just for a minute  to  and then I will 
how are you  
everything worked out okay with  
oh dear  
oh  good  
are you okay  
uh  three thirty or four  
but I'd still like you to come  
and 
well  we're starting  um  music together again  so 
I probably won't be there much earlier  
that would 
okay  
okay  
 
yes  
she's a  
she's a  
what else are you gonna have  
also  
it has a cut  
it looks like it has a kiwi seed on it  
well it doesn't look like it has a cut  
is it really hurting  
well 
it might be a cut that's hard for me to see  
so  I'll get some water  
now 
if it's hurting now from the kiwi that probably means it will hurt if you get tomato sauce on it  
so I think you should try to 
either use your other hand  your right hand  when you eat your spaghetti  or you should use a spoon  
n'kay  
you want some more juice now  
alright  
you can have a little more later  
I'll give it back to you  
alrightie  
what was I doing  
I was gonna get you some tomato sauce  
looking for the 
yeah  
I'm right here  
we're shakin' hands  
you're sitting in the highchair shaking your mommy's hand  
 
Mommy's kissing your hand  
 
lemme open the can  
and I'll give you some  
yup  yup  yup  
now I'm going to find a spoon for you  
so you can start eating tomato sauce  
you wanna bowl  
kay  
you can do the same thing that we were talking bout this morning  
well  it's tomato sauce  
it's the same kind that you used to like all the time  
see  
do you wanna have a sippa your juice  
I'm gonna test the pasta and see if it's ready  
oh  it might be ready  
okay  
mm  
I think it needs one more minute  
it's a little on the chewy side  
you can chew some but it's not quite ready yet  
just needs another minute  
on the timer  
I was pressing a button on the timer  
you're doing a good job not spilling very much  
you're getting really good at feeding yourself  
m'kay  
now I'm gonna drain the pasta  
I'm gonna pour all the water out  
it's the timer  
here it is  
I'm gonna cool down the 
turn that off  
whoa  that's too much for you  isn't it  
I'm trying to cool down the pasta by putting it in the cold spaghetti sauce  
it will make the spaghetti cool enough to eat  
 in the Max book that we saw at the library  
I think he says zoom when he comes down the chimney 
Mommy test it and see  
um  it's just warm  
I think that's okay for you to eat  
do you want some more salty cheese  
or not  
you want it over here or on top of your pasta  
I think Mommy's gonna sit and eat with you too  
is that a good spoon for what you're eating  
Mommy's very very hungry too  
I'm gonna eat pasta with salty cheese  
and tomato sauce  just like you are  
think I'm gonna heat up my tomato sauce  
 
in a little container  
let me get a paper towel  
what's that  
gonna see tomorrow  
 
yeah  
 
just chew that spaghetti up nice  
and here's some juice if you wanna drink it  
I'll put it over here  
you did  
you called her  
 
mm  
so 
maybe we'll turn this back on when we're actually talking instead of eating  
you're a soggy doggy  
that's what you're telling me  
there've only been about five or ten minutes that've elapsed  
now I'm talking to you again  
are you a soggy doggy  
yeah  
you look like you're a spaghetti Freddy  
or spaghetti Betty  
did you drink all your juice  
n'kay  
you want some more juice juicy water  
you want some d a lhin  
you want some almond butter  
you need some protein though  
protein  
no  
you don't need protein  
you want some e d a m a m ejpn beans  
 
actually those might be too old to eat  
lemme just take a look at em  
hm  
 
oh  they're fine  
see  
they're called e d a m a m ejpn  
e d a m a m ejpn  
they're called e d a m a m ejpn  
 
now  you might need to drink some liquid to help you swallow those  
chew em a lot  and then swallow them  
don't just spit them out  
electricity  
I was reading that somewhere  
what were we reading 
what book were we reading that mentioned electricity  
were we reading a book  
can you make sure to chew those really well  
even more than that  
 
lemme see  
no  keep em in your mouth  
they're good to swallow  
 
you can hold that  
that's what happens sometimes  
that's what happens sometimes  
yep  
what about electricity  
 
what do you know about electricity  
you can chew it a lot and then swallow it  
using the water  
make sure you chew it enough  and then swallow it  
kay  
electricity  
electricity  
oh  you're t 
is that what you're thinking about  
hm  
the electricity wasn't on  
y'an a little more tomato sauce  
yeah  
electricity is what makes the lights go on  
like this  
and the camera  it m 
electricity is good for m 
well 
like the slide that's at Daisy's playhouse  
that makes all that noise  
a reason it makes all that noise is because it's using electricity  
sort of  
that's what it's called  
electricity  
it's a funny word  isn't it  
electricity is what 
you used to 
or a computer 
or a dishwasher 
or a light 
a lamp 
or the television  
what else uses electricity  
the blender  
the coffee grinder  
you hafta use electricity to use all those things  
even that computer  
Mommy's one on the desk there  
Mommy's gonna run in the other room to get another cookbook to look at  
I'll be right back  
Naima  would you like to eat some applesauce or some carrots

what  
d'you wanna eat some fresh apple  Naima  
you're a tomato sauce girl  
dry off your hand  
this hand needs a wet 
your right 
paper towel  
you can dry off your other hand on that  
thank you  
because 
you have tomato sauce on you 
and your hands 
and I have been wiping the tomato sauce off  
it comes off of you and it goes onto the 
paper towel when I do that  
it's even on your nose  
 
I'll take that
