it's December twenty fourth 
you're not actually 
at this moment 
look at these really nice outdoor gloves 
and 
another umbrella 
do you remember what this is 
it says Diwali two thousand and three on it 
show it to Daddy 
we made it at uh color me mime 
candle holder fer 
and this is the present for 
Great Grandma 
it's Naima's handprint 
and it says 
n a i m a 
elephant 
does that spell elephant 
are you hungry 
I thought you were gonna help wrap presents anyway 
alright 
well 
looking for my wrapping paper 
yeah 
that's what I'm talking about 
you can stomp but 
um just 
if you want something you can use your regular voice to ask me 
okay 
there's Naima and we're gonna wrap presents 
alright 
this is gonna go right here 
I'm gonna cut you some paper 
alright 
I think so 
make sure this is gonna be the right size 
let's see 
oh yes that should be enough 
okay 
do you remember how we did it earlier today 
you fold one end up and then the next end 
yep 
you do it yourself 
by fold you rub 
see where my finger is 
rub it with your whole hand 
to make it crease 
good 
and then you fold this half down 
and then make a crease with your hand all the way here 
le me show you 
slide your hand like that 
there 
okay 
wanna put some tape on 
you want another piece 
I think Grandma really gonna like this present 
good 
here's another one 
here's another piece 
kay 
put a piece right here where this white part is 
but so that it covers the edge of the paper 
alright 
we turn it around 
and then it's time to make the triangles 
there's one triangle 
take the corner 
fold it way up 
way up like that 
good 
you did 
and then you fold the whole thing up 
fold both triangles up 
like that 
and then you tape that part 
this is like a flap isn't it 
you attach the flap 
to the present with the tape 
and then 
you turn it all the way around gently 
so that this is the edge that you make the triangles on now 
so let's make triangles here 
one here 
well let go for a sec 
take the corner 
bring it up to where the edge of the present inside the wrapping is 
and then what do you do d you remember 
you bring this edge way up 
that's right 
yeah and then tape 
le me get my tape 
yeah gotta hold it down 
well you mostly wanna tape the flap to 
the main part of the present 
to the big part of the present 
so that the flap stays down 
yep 
kay 
that's on my finger isn't it 
here 
good 
you don't need too much just need enough to keep the flap down it doesn't hafta be 
that amount of sticking up is actually okay 
okay 
now 
turn it so that the tape is on the bottom 
yeah that's the present for Grandma it look very nice 
now I'm gonna put this box together to wrap the hat and gloves for Grandma 
the hat I got for my mom 
yes 
I hope she will wear it 
and this is 
these are the gloves 
purple gloves 
and I think what I wanna do 
is 
I wanna 
no maybe that won't work 
I guess I'm gonna put the gloves inside the hat 
and then 
wrap it a little bit like this 
and put it in the box 
 
and then we'll wrap the box in some wrapping paper 
think I'll 
tape the box just a little bit closed 
to make sure it stays closed 
okay can you put that tape right there 
right here 
right at the edge 
yep and rub it 
so that closes the box 
now we need wrapping paper 
um 
um 
I think we use the gold wrapping paper 
okay 
yep you're gonna help but le me cut the right size of paper first 
oh the weather outside is frightful 
with the wrong notes 
because that's a song that I can never remember the right notes to 
okay this is our piece of paper for this box 
do you remember what the first thing we should do is 
well the first thing we do 
the nice side of the wrapping paper the side we want to show is actually on the floor 
the white part 
and then we put our present down on the wrapping paper 
do you remember what we do 
you take your end of the paper 
well we don't do the triangles just yet 
take this in one hand 
bring the paper right up here 
onto the box 
not triangles 
just bring all the paper 
right up onto the box 
I'm holding this one down 
so we're gonna cover 
here's some tape 
cover the box 
with the paper 
yep go ahead and put the tape right there that's good 
and I'll put a piece there and I think we need one more little piece 
right at the end 
good 
the secret to good wrapping is not to use too much tape I think 
this is a box so it's a little different 
our triangle's gonna look like that 
and like that 
now can you bring this up onto the main part of the box 
pull up and then over 
it's different from wrapping something flat 
kay I'm holding this will you put some tape 
we don't wanna cover all the edges with tape we just wanna use 
a small 
amount 
teeny tiny pieces of tape 
would you put that one over there 
good okay 
and I'll put one here 
and now I'm gonna bring it around 
make some triangles on this side 
don't use it until I tell you okay 
where's the triangles 
and then folding it up 
bringing it over 
there 
right on the edge and I'll put one little piece right here too 
and that's done 
well we have a lot more to wrap but we need to make sure we label these and and wrap them with ribbons and things so that 
uh so that we know who they're for 
cause that's important too isn't it 
I wonder if I put all my ribbons and other things in some strange location 
I'm gonna look in the closet over here 
to see if the 
somehow got over here by accident 
oh I think that's the supper that's ready 
cause uh Daddy and I um 
put supper in the oven to heat up 
just a sec boo boo 
maybe I put it in here 
nope I guess not 
hm 
well that's alright we're just gonna make a little tag for Grandma that says 
Grandma 
let's see maybe I'll use the pinking shears 
should I make a circle 
and maybe a 
how bout if I make a 
I bet she'd like that 
that's what this is for 
for 
for 
Grandma 
actually I'm gonna write merry Christmas from Naima okay 
is that okay 
merry 
Christmas 
from 
Naima 
it says for Grandma 
merry Christmas 
from Naima 
I might add an exclamation point 
okay would you like to tape that 
to the top of the package there 
bring your picture over 
take this 
you wanna tape it right on 
you have two pieces one for each side 
what I mean is one for each edge 
you can decide where you wanna put it 
decide where on the package you wanna put it 
okay 
I would put that piece there 
if I were you 
excellent 
that's great 
and this present 
is from all of us 
for 
Mom 
and then I'm gonna say parentheses 
Grandma 
from 
 
and then I'm gonna write in parentheses and also 
from and 
and Naima 
and then I'm gonna tape that 
I'm gonna fold the tape 
and make it almost like a piece of glue 
so that this becomes like a sticker 
now 
these presents can go under the tree 
wanna put them under the tree 
and carry them over there 
you've got a little 
thing here okay 
bring em over this way 
le me take this Diwali thing out of the way 
okay go ahead honey 
and this one too 
great 
okay 
come on back over here 
I think I'm gonna take a break from wrapping so that we can all have dinner 
would you like to do that 
okay 
do you think that you could go down and tell Daddy that dinner is ready 
wait where 
rough and smooth 
like a long time and then a short time 
I thought the cookies were 
um whole then crumbled 
 
how bout 
curly and straight 
good 
hm 
or bitter 
because you can have something that's not salty that's unsalted but it's not necessarily sweet 
I know how many tastes there are 
I'm aware of that one too but 
I still think sweet 
I agree that either bitter or sour but I don't think that salty 
I'll grant you that 
you know what you can have a camel cookie but I would like you to have some fruit too 
would you like some apple 
no I don't think so 
 
what Naima 
Naima do you like the peel 
oh I see 
well you can do what 
would you like some 
it's fiber 
easily 
if you eat all that apple 
and you're still hungry 
after you eat all that apple 
then you can have camel 
uh yeah 
can you use any help down there Daddy 
no 
here's hoping 
Naima's cookies just came out 
they hafta cool down 
 
um 
I'm gonna try and look for that wrapping paper 
well did you see what I 
is that enough 
because we actually have a B I G thing that 
I just 
I think I used it when I was wrapping right before we left 
so maybe it's behind the couch or something like that 
the sleepy bear that went to Alaska 
mhm 
Naima it's Christmas Eve 
what do you think's gonna happen tomorrow 
are you gonna hang up a stocking 
in front of the fire place 
and when I woke up in the morning 
my stockings would be bulging 
yeah 
presents 
I think a stocking would be a good thing for Naima to hang in front of the fireplace 
why the fireplace though 
who comes down chimneys 
I'm coming out and going to work 
really 
hm 
well 
I will look for that other wrapping paper 
do you remember who I said was coming to visit 
are you gonna make uh 
would you like to do that now 
later 
at a certain point 
for sure 
oh that's it 
that's who's coming 
great grandma 
grandma 
and 
and Daddy and Mommy and Naima that's who will be here tomorrow 
we'll make special holiday food 
we'll open presents 
maybe we'll play games 
yeah 
I'm sure she'd love to play games with you tomorrow 
grandma 
even great grandma could play 
if you fall off you it could really hurt 
you could hurt yourself 
did you say 
okay 
so you gonna notice when you need to pee or poop 
let's go then 
can you go by yourself 
uh like big kid 
okay 
well you can finish chewing on your way there 
to the potty 
you gonna take off your own big kid pants and everything 
I won't come with you you're a big kid 
just call me if you need me to help you wipe 
 
bedtime is over 
please don't rip that out 
please leave that 
Naima 
please 
leave 
that 
do you want to help 
okay so don't destroy the things here okay 
thank you Naima 
we have a lot of things to wrap 
we need a wrapping strategy 
alright 
hm 
okay now that Daddy's downstairs I'm gonna go get a present for him 
that I have in the other room okay 
there's sleepy bear 
kay 
this is a present for Daddy I don't want him to know about it 
so we hafta keep it secret 
secret secret secret 
now what did I do with the scissors 
there's scissors 
here's tape 
okay 
 
kay 
you're going to the present wrapping place 
sit right here 
and I'll let you help me 
that bear still has bandaids on doesn't he 
yeah 
okay 
this is Daddy's present 
just because 
what it is 
let's wrap it in some paper before he comes upstairs again 
cause it's more fun 
you are 
okay 
you really need a shirt on so you can wear this mic 
I know I'll put it right on my pants 
closer to you 
okay 
I'm gonna wrap this for Daddy 
I'll let you help put the tape on okay 
okay 
can you fold this edge up 
fold that edge up 
no not triangles yet 
this way first 
kay 
fold this one down 
well first we need some tape 
presents are more fun if they're kept secret 
well I think so anyway 
people have opinions and that's my opinion 
do you need a tissue 
I see 
do triangles 
take the corner this is the corner 
and then bring the corner up right here 
just bring it all the way up 
like right to there 
and then fold it down to make the triangle 
now take this corner 
fold it 
right there 
and then we made a big triangle here 
and now we can tape it 
good 
yep 
you just need one 
not too much tape 
and then rub it after you put it on 
okay that's good 
this is a present from Mommy to Daddy 
I need tags though 
hm 
whose name is that 
can you read that 
i 
can you sound it out 
in this case it sounds like 
 
 
 
and then 
 
this was 
I don't know when I made this label it was a long time ago 
the letter 
that's sometimes what jammed means 
how bout juicy 
remember g sometimes sounds like j 
it's very confusing I know 
um 
joke 
junior 
yes 
junior does 
j u m uh j u m isn't really a word actually 
I'm attaching 
the card onto the present 
with the ribbon and the tape like this 
whoa 
one day a child walked and walked and walked and walked 
mm 
oh that's your staff 
oh okay 
are you going to have a bath tonight or a shower tomorrow morning 
alright 
to take a shower 
cause it's almost bedtime 
alright 
well you can have a pajama bottom also 
oh please don't rip that paper sweetie pie 
please leave that alone 
do you wanna put on these 
let's leave that alone now that you've unwrapped it 
because 
are gonna need to use it 
there's your pajama 
top and bottom 
can you put them on yourself 
me 
why would I wear just bottoms to bed 
 
is that what he does 
really 
do you need help 
can I just look 
you know what since you have big kid pants on 
just put the tops on for now 
diaper on anyway before you go to sleep 
unless your legs are really cold 
that's your pajama top 
I don't think I'll fit in it 
it can fit on you though sweetie 
oh you know what 
these are some pants for you 
if they don't fit I might send them back 
why don't you try em on and see 
just try em on and see if they fit 
easy to pull down 
for when you're in school 
and you can go to the potty by yourself 
yes well the teacher's always there to help you if you need help but 
I thought maybe you'd like pants that are easy to get off and on to go to school with 
these are slightly long but that's something that Mommy can fix 
in fact maybe I'll fix it soon 
come here for a sec 
just hold still for a sec I wanna see something 
I wanna see how much I need to hem them 
bring them up 
further 
that's about where I'm gonna hem them I guess 
nice pants 
you can take em off now 
every day 
they'll need to be washed won't they 
Mommy's gonna hem them and then 
I think you have the right idea 
you can put that top on now 
good 
oh yeah 
what are you putting on im 
is he a big kid Naima 
I didn't think he was 
alright 
oh he's wearing the knickies huh 
cause they're too big for him 
Naima

this is the part that's gonna go at the back of your neck 
so when you put it on
