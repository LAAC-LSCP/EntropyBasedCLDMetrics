beep beep says the car  
honk honk says the truck

don't get stuck  
well mud can sometimes make cars stop  
and get stuck in the mud 'cause the tires won't spin  
tires need to spin for the car to go  
and mud can stop tires from spinning  
it looks almost as if the frogs are saying watch out  don't get stuck

oh  why don't the bird children pick out some books now  
not yet  
what else do people do at a library  
they read books  they pick out books to take home  
sometimes libraries have toys  
sometimes you go and you talk to the librarian about something  
once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll house  
yes we do have a chimney  
yes  we have a book rack  
what color is our house on the outside  
outside  when we drive up and we look at our house and we're still in the car and we're going to go in the house  what color is the outside of the house  
what color's the door  
what color  
those're white curtains  
it belonged to two dolls named Lucinda and Jane  
Jane was the cook  
but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought ready made in a box full of shavings  
there were two red lobsters and a ham  
a fish  a pudding and some pears and oranges  
they would not come off the plates but they were extremely beautiful  
this is describing some toy food  
one morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the dolls perambulator  
there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet  
in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirting board  
Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again  
Tom Thumb was a mouse  
this is a story about mice  
d'you want me to keep reading  
a minute afterwards Hunka Munka  his wife  put out her head too  
and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oil cloth under the coal box  
the dolls' house stood at the other side of the fireplace  
Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went cautiously across the hearth rug  
they pushed the front door  
Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went upstairs and peeped into the dining room  
then they squeaked with joy  
squeak  
such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table  
there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dolly chairs  all so convenient  
 
Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham  
it was a beautiful shiny yellow streaked with red  
the knife crumpled up and hurt him  
it is not boiled enough  it is hard  
Hunka Munka stood up on her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife  
it's as hard as the hams at the cheese monger's  
Hunka Munka  isn't that a funny name  
the ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table  
let it alone  
Hunka Munka tried every tin spoon in turn  the fish was glued to the dish  
then Tom Thumb lost his temper  he put the ham in the middle of the floor and hit it with the tongs  
and with the shovel the shovel  
okay  let's something else

should we have Griz be a big bear  
Griz could be a big bear

Big Bear lit the tiniest lantern and put it next to Little Bear's bed
