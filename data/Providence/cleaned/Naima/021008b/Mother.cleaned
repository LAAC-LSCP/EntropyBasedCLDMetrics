okay on this there's only been about five or ten minutes 
interval between the last tape and this one 
on the twenty second of January 
that's my name 
yes 
what about the doll's stuffed animals 
the daddy's gonna go to work now 
okay 
oh 
oh 
okay 
well we could put the base plate there 
in the basement 
yeah he has a lotta messed up papers down there that's true 
well we could use regular chairs for his desk chair 
we could put two of these together to make his desk 
like that 
that's about the size of his desk and we could put a chair there 
you know we could build it and then we could slide it underneath after we build it 
what do you think 
the base plate 
but while we're building it we can keep it right here if we want to 
kay 
what else does he have down here 
the treadmill 
okay 
this block almost look like a treadmill if it was this way 
that's true it doesn't have a hold in it 
hm 
the treadmill also has like two handles 
doesn't it 
kind of like you know to go up to the side that he holds onto I thought I would make that part 
wait wait wait wait wait wait 
cause I thought you know like he when he walks on the treadmill 
he holds on 
right 
yeah 
and then there's a bar across them 
let's get one more ye small yellow lego 
to go here 
and then something goes across that he 
I don't really 
huh 
something is wrong with this lego 
so it can kinda doesn't this kinda look like the treadmill 
then he has uh he has a sofa right here doesn't he 
next to his desk 
a pink one 
do you need to use the potty 
okay 
let's go look 
the one that's a pullout sofa that greatgrandma slept on when she was with us 
it pulls out 
and turns into a bed 
yeah you know which one I mean 
should we make that 
you're right 
could we use red instead maybe 
you're right there are no pink legos 
that's part of the sofa 
I'm pretending that's the part that you sit on and this is the back of the sofa 
I'm just pretending 
if the doll was there she'd be she'd sit like this 
on the sofa 
this is a nonfunctioning Lego 
yup push 
watch Mommy do it 
pushing 
you can use your regular voice if you want help with something sweetie 
Bibby would sit like that 
is that Bibby 
Bibby and Bobby 
mhm 
here's a bed 
guests sleep over here 
in the guest bedroom 
there's the bed 
there's a little table in our guest bedroom isn't there 
like this table was on this side 
this side 
the table that holds magazines and things 
and I think maybe there's even 
is there a little table on this side too 
alright 
okay 
did you see that I put the water colors and papers out for whenever you're ready 
yeah there might be just one I don't remember 
if there's two or one 
it's still snowing out look 
you can see some snow falling still 
cause the lights aren't on 
and it's a dark day it's not a sunny day 
alright here we are 
oh there are two tables see 
one on that side 
and one on that side 
you could do that 
is your neck itchy 
oopsie 
cause it's got a zipper 
here hold still for a second 
okay leave that there 
please 
you wanna unzip it all the way 
okay I'll move the microphone then 
okay just a sec 
alright 
alright 
you don't hafta inhale it 
let's go upstairs 
inhale means to breathe 
you looked like you were breathing in the microphone 
I don't know 
oh that's what you were doing 
yes oh you're in luck 
Naima I'm gonna check and see if there's any laundry I need doing I'll be right back 
just to the washing machine 
hi 
hey where's your microphone 
oh brother 
on the floor okay 
you wanna do the painting now 
because I thought that it might be easier if I give you one color and then another and then another 
because that way the colors you won't get all all mixed up on the brush 
which is what sometimes happens 
well there's actually some water right there 
and there's also some on top so there's some in there 
yeah ooh 
yeah of course not you can take as long as you want 
thank you sweetie 
you can let me know if you decide you want another color 
okay 
which color would you like next 
um purple green blue orange red 
brown 
you want brown okay 
I'll get you brown 
and then after you're done with brown you can pick out another color 
WodneyWat 
some toddlers can't 
well because even when you're a little kid you're still learning how to talk aren't ya 
it's not so easy 
to learn how to talk 
it's a very difficult thing 
yup that's another way you can do it alright 
oh what color would you like next 
er wed or red 
okay 
let me have that brush 
and I will get you the red now 
do you like that WodneyWat story 
why does the title of the book say WodneyWat instead of RodneyRat 
the way Wodney says his name 
because it's about him it doesn't use 
well grownups usually can pronounce things 
it's just that when you're little and growing up some things are hard to pronounce 
it's hard to twist your mouth in that just the right way 
don't you think 
do you think it's hard to say some words 
what words do you think it's hard to say 
there's water right in there 
yup the paint gets into the water and colors the water red 
what's in my nose or anyone's nose 
hm 
there's little hairs in most people's noses 
the hairs keep all the dirt out 
and other things from getting up into your nose and your throat 
well if you didn't have all the little hairs in your nose then you might get big pieces of dust or little pieces of dirt up in your throat 
cause your nose is actually connected to your throat 
okay 
with a tail 
blue air above oh like sky you mean 
here's some black 
on your painting 
what things are black 
well sometimes the sky can look black if there's a storm coming 
it's usually a very very dark grey not actually black 
but at night sometimes the sky can look black 
when it's nighttime 
the animal eats the black thing 
oh 
that's alright 
I'll clean it up 
when you're done with the painting 
oh 
which pink part 
oh 
that's where its nose is 
huh 
uhhuh 
okay 
mygoodness 
it's really snowin 
you want some blue now 
okay 
should I take that 
mhm 
that's part of the sky 
um I think the you haven't had the green or the orange or the purple but you've had the other colors 
that are not good to eat 
the sky can be purplish if there's a nice sunset 
and some flowers are purple 
let's see 
let me get you the purple 
are you all done with the blue 
do you want me to get the purple or are you still painting with the blue 
do you want me to get the purple for you 
yup you can call them pictures or paintings 
well they're pictures 
you could say your painting a picture or you could say your painting a painting 
cause painting means what you're doing but it also means what it is you painted 
yeah I think that's probably what we say in this house we say you're painting a painting 
or your painting a picture 
I guess maybe we say both 
here is the purple 
sky can be purple sometimes if there is sunset 
and it's more that it's purplish it's not usually bright purple 
mhm 
oh boy 
are you done with the purple 
you wanna keep the purple there and I'll give you some orange 
I'll give you a separate I'll give you a different 
brush for the orange so that the orange and the purple don't get all mixed together 
so I'll put the orange all the way over here let me get some water for that 
let's see 
okay 
now I'll actually move this down here since you're mostly done with the purple 
now you can use the brush for the orange 
well 
usually it's part of a sunrise colors or sunset colors you can see orange 
I think green is the only one you haven't had 
okay 
don't paint on the table please 
you can use this brush for the green 
can you think of anything 
no 
when you go outside what things do you see that are green outside 
ah yes 
grass 
would you like another piece of paper 
you mean you're done painting that one 
wow 
do you need a little water next to the green 
looks like it 
here 
oop a little too much 
that's for me 
I'm gonna come look at it 
do you want me to write anything on it or do you wanna just leave it without any writing on it 
hm 
yeah it needs sometime to dry 
lemme get you some paper 
I'm gonna get you a smaller piece this time 
so now you have three colors 
you have orange green and purple all together there 
well so that you don't mix the colors up 
the colors will mix up and probably become some version of brown 
sometimes you wanna do that but you may not wanna do that all the time 
so this way you can use more than one brush 
one for each color if you want to 
and what color are you finding that you make when you do that 
what would you call the combination color 
I was peeling carrots and slicing them 
no I was actually peeling them 
hm 
making some lines 
hm 
hm 
well when he comes home you can tell him about combining the colors 
it's seems like I do get a picture almost every day you've given me one 
it's very nice to have them 
really 
he's at work 
you know those brushes really are shedding their their brush their 
these aren't very good brushes 
cause they're just coming out 
the uh bristles these are called the bristles 
the bristles just are coming right out 
are you done with this one do you want me to put it aside 
do you want any writing on it 
mm kay 
you wanna write with a different with a pen or a crayon or something 
you can write letters with paint 
do you wanna try that 
yeah 
you're gonna do it 
 it says for Daddy from Naima 
hm 
yup 
 you want another piece of paper to make another one 
I'll pour some extra water how's that 
you're right a toothbrush is another thing that has brushes on it 
brushes like this 
do you wanna ask me for some certain colors 
you want a set of colors for your painting 
not the same ones 
okay 
which ones then 
I'm gonna give you the the really thick brush 
you don't want the white one 
that's from what you painted yesterday that's dried up 
remember we bought brown and yellow yesterday 
do you want brown or yellow to mix with another color 
shall I display some paint 
the older paint 
okay 
the batteries just ran out I think 
ooh look at those colors look at that blue that you made 
we're combining wow 
I really like that color 
that's for me 
alright 
daughters son is 
daughters name now what is her name 
 was it 
 
 
is daughter 
and I believe her name is 
confusing huh 
you saw nursing with 
a little baby 
is why she nurses her 
she's a lucky baby 
lucky baby 
you're not 
no you're not 
well parents always call their children baby because they were once a baby 
so parents always call their children that in kind of a 
as a as a way of saying I love you 
I'm your baby you mean you love me 
I love you 
I'm gonna let it dry and then hang it up that is beautiful 
do you wanna make another one 
another one for Dad 
yeah I know but you made two for me and one for him 
you can make two for me and two for him 
if you still feel like painting 
are you still painting this 
you want another piece of paper 
don't you think 
I don't actually want you to paint on the table 
would you like more of the same colors 
a yellow banana 
 
is this for Daddy 
yeah it's okay 
oh 
 
we'll take it all off and we'll wash it 
I think you do 
you haven't had one for awhile and now you do have a lot of paint on you 
I think we'll wash all of you Naima 
Daddy 
mothers call their children babies even if they're not really babies anymore 
it's kind of you know it's kind of just an expression you know that means 
an expression is something that's not exactly true 
but in this case it means 
it's kind of like saying I love you I remember when you were a baby 
you're my baby because you're my baby from the day you were born 
or you're my baby ever since you were teenie and tiny 
and I took care of you and did everything for you I remember doing that 
when a mommy or a daddy calls a toddler or a bigger kid a baby even my mother sometimes says you know you're still my baby 
oh it's just a way of saying 
so when Mommy or Daddy calls you baby it's just another way of saying hey I love you 
what do you think of that 
I know Daddy is going to really like that picture a lot 
yeah 
you're done with all your painting 
I need to make sure 
that is a really splendid painting 
splendid means quite nice quite nice 
it will dry but it will take awhile it might be dry tomorrow morning

mhm 
another another and brother 
here's some fingerpaint 
oh well you know what since you're gonna be using fingerpaint anyway 
 okay 
this is fingerpaint paper it's a little bit slippery 
kind of like a slippery paper 
oh snakes I think 
the people who made the paint are the ones who decided to paint the pictures on them 
why do you think they might do that 
why do you think there's any pictures at all 
on the paint containers 
maybe to show people who are in the store what's inside 
the container 
oh thanks 
oh 
does fingerpaint dry 
um if it does it's don't know if it does 
what's so funny 
so slimy ooh
