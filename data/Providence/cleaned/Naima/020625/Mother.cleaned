I can't tell  
well it  for a minute it looked like a little dragonfly  but it wasn't  it was just a piece of fuzz  
look  doesn't it a little bit  
I'm trying to think of what this may have come off of  
m'not sure  
yeah if you feel this fuzz and then feel the black part of the raccoon's tail 
they feel similar  
 texture is similar  
what thing  
what thing  
 
oh  did you drop it  
it's here  
to me  
it looked a little bit like a dragonfly 
am I gonna be the customer or is one of your animals  
okay  
you wanna go to your room together  
your room  your room is the store  
why don't we buy some more things at this store 
and then we'll go to the other store  we'll be doing a lot of shopping today  
you know you could pretend to buy the barn that we just bought at the Waldorf school store  
I'm gonna go put some water on for my tea  okay  
the raccoon and us don't have a name  
I'm gonna go put my water on  I just wanted to find your backpack first  
where is your little pink  
oof  that was loud  
here it is  
would you like to take someone for a ride in it  
mm  
maybe Griz 
raccoon  
go ahead and put him in  
yeah  
Naima's gonna carry you and you can look outside while you're going  
you're going to Kawadee Head with him  
okay lemme put this on your 
oh the way it is on Mommy and Daddy sometimes  
okay  
let me  turn around  let me fix him  
he needs to be more upright so he can see everything  
okay  
let's see  
oh that's perfect  I think he's looking forward to hiking  
I think Griz is in the kitchen sitting in a chair  let's go in 'cause I wanna start my water anyway  
so you're hiking at Kawadee Head  do you like it here  
what are the kinds of things you can see at Kawadee Head  
what's Griz gonna do at Kawadee Head  
oh gee  I'm not sure I know which ones those are  
but I know where there are some rocks  
I think this would be  make some very nice water for Kawadee Head  
 
okay Griz  do you like throwing them  
oh where's the backpack  
the raccoon got out of it  
oh is that why the raccoon got out  
I see  
ah  
let's put your backpack on because you know what  you're carrying your picnic lunch in it  
you're on a hike  you were on a hike to Kawadee Head and you need to still carry your lunch  
well  let's just pretend  
really  
where'r you gonna push Griz to on his very fun ride  
oh  does Kawadee Head have a playground  
oh   playground with a bear walk  
oh I'm trying to remember which one that is  
oh I know where you mean  
the  I know the bear walk one  where we took your shoes off  
that was the Machias playground  
school playground at Machias  
yes we took your shoes off and it was a bear walk and it went up  too  
it was like bear walking up a hill  
that was in Lubec  that playground  
meanwhile he's gonna find the doll  
that was in Lubeck also  
that was at a little shop  a little  actually a little art gallery  and there was a hurdygurdy man and a hurdygurdy woman playing hurdygurdies  
you think Griz would like to listen to that music  
great  
oh  
I'm going to come back and listen after I make my tea  I hear the water boiling  
mm  
the raccoon plays the hurdygurdy  
wow  
I can't wait to hear it  I'm gonna come listen in just a minute  
Naima we might go in a little while and bring shoes back to her  
well  I think we will  
I'm not sure if we're gonna see her though  that's the only thing  
'cause she went somewhere to visit her cousins today  
and I don't know if she'll be back 
by the time we go  
well  they're her new shoes  I don't think she's even worn them very much  
I mean  that you gave her  
those are her boots now  
you've got bigger feet than she has  
oh they're not very small but they're smaller than yours  and they just fit those boots perfectly  
would you like a raisin  
mm  
okay  let's go hear that hurdygurdy playing raccoon  
I can't wait to hear it  
I'm listening  
 my clog is the hurdygurdy  
are you turning the handle  raccoon  
do you remember the hurdygurdies had handles that you turn  
Griz is going to swim in the water  
let's see how he swims  
mm  
are you gonna show him or does he already know  
 really  
wow  
woo  look at you go  
you guys are swimming together  aren't you  
I can just barely hear it  
what does it sound like  
it was barely whating  
the red bell  
on the floor right there  
right there  
next to the yellow chair on the floor  the lego chair  
near the helicopter  yep  
oh you're playing faith and our fathers on that  
on the bell  
are you going to comfort him  
no  
you're gonna let him be scared  
what did he swallow  
hm  
that poor bear  
oh  
oh it was dark outside  
oh and then is he having the snack of blueberries when he's home  
blueberries in the car  I bet that makes a big mess  
you think so  
only little kids make really big messes  
'cause big kids know how to be a little neater and clean up after themselves and they  big kids don't drop their blueberries all over the place  
because they know that it's good to put them right in your mouth  
g u h m u h  what does that mean  
he was  
ooh  y'alright  
looks like you did fall  Betsy  
I don't know  maybe you weren't watching where you were going  
are you gonna fall asleep right during supper again  
you like doing that these days  huh  
oh to the Lubeck library  
what  
he is going to Maine  
it's gonna take him quite a while to get there  isn't it  
is he driving his box  
Griz do you have enough gas in your box to take you to  all the way to Maine  
oh  you better stop at the gas station on your way to Maine then
