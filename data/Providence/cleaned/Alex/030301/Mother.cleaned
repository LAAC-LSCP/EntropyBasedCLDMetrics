I dunno what that is  
he'll ask you for a 
once he's nice and cozy he'll want to listen to 
what's that  
you'll have to find some on the radio  
he'll probably sing along  
the carols will remind him of his Christmas tree  
so he'll want to make ornaments  
you'll get him some 
and some 
he'll ask you for some 
glitter  
when the sno 
he'll hang them up  all up  
then he'll stand back to look at the 
he'll notice his popcorn string is missing

church is God's house  
we pray in church  praying is like talking to God  
I love you is a prayer God always likes to hear  
we can also say thank you God or help me God or gee God I'm sorry  
we listen to God's words in church too  
he speaks to us through stories from a book called the Bible  
in the Bible God tells us about himself and how he wants us to live  
when we think about God at church  
no there's no more pages  about how wonderful he is and how good he is to us  
what's this  
what else do we do at church
