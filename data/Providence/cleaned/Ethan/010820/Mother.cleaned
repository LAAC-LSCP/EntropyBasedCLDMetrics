you wan another story  
I'm get you a different one  
about a bear 
and what's that  
what's that  
this thing  
it's a rainbow  right  
sky fire  
look how pretty it is  it's colorful  
one day  Bear looked out his window and saw a rainbow  
he had never seen a rainbow before  
to Bear  it looked like the sky was on fire  
ohmygoodness  called Bear to his friend Little Bird  
just look at the sky  
flew over to Bear's window  
why  it's a rainbow  said Little Bird  
come on  let's go find the pot of gold  
pot of gold  said Bear  what are you talking about  
they say there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  
the sky is on fire and all you can do is talk about gold  
it's a honey pot  
just like Pooh likes honey  
this bear likes honey too  
at the pond Bear filled the pot with water  
then he ran toward the rainbow  
he ran and he ran and he ran  
look  Bear  said Little Bird  the rainbow ends right by that tree  
like we saw today yesterday  
he was busy climbing a hill  
when he got to the top  he threw water at the rainbow  
there he goes  he's throwing water at it  
it's going  going  going  gone  
Little Bird chirped  
look Bear  I found the gold  
Bear went to the tree  
inside  he found lotsof golden honey  
he filled his pot  
and took it home  
that night Little Bird came over  
Bear made honeycakes  
after dinner they went for a boat ride  
for a long while they were very quiet  
and I found the pot of gold  
it was a sky fire  
and I put it out
