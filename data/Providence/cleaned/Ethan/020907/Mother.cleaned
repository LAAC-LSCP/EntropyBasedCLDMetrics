the ambulance  or the fire 
mkay  
well  we only have one left  right  
very mixed up trucks  I'm very confused  
I think so  
so you need some string  you something to tie you to the spaceship so you don't float away  
singing the Spanish song  
the one about the astronaut  
it says it in the video 
let's see 
whoops

e s p a c i ospa means space  e s p a c i o sspa  
e s p a c i ospa

the rocket will fly  
through the clouds  
spinners  
I don't know what that is  
through the space  through the clouds  over the deep blue sea  
while the moon goes round and round  my rocket will fly  through the space  through the clouds  over the deep blue sea  
 while the moon goes round and round  my rocket will fly and then in space  full of stars  I see our beautiful earth  
you want the mixed up trucks

that would be a little bit more like a scooter  
yeah  in Po in the shorts  or Po out of the shorts  
there you go  
he's very happy  cause scooter is his favorite thing  right  
so she could have something to sit on

and Po went around and around and around  
we put Po on here 
Tinky Winky's up there  on the shelf

cause you need to be safe  Tinky Winky  
oh yep

your gear board and erase them  
that's what makes them write  
a big blue mess  
 
 
wire  
in your special astronaut wire  
so you can go up to space  
yup  
what should we make a spaceship out of  
we need something round 
and we need a triangle shape  
cause usually a 
as a spaceship is  well we could use some cardboard maybe  
we'll see  
let's see what supplies we have in here  
supplies  that's different from surprise  
that's not good for making a spaceship  
that would make a good top to a spaceship  
now all we need is 
where did it go  
I bet it's right here  
mkay  we can make this round  
tape it  
and then attach 
the funnel to it  
you have the funnel  
maybe like that  
that looks a bit like a rocketship  
a what  
well this is kind of a triangle shape  
I was pretending this was the triangle  
you wanna make a different kind of triangle  
should we tape this  so it stays  
like a circle  
you could put one of your guys inside  and he can blast off to outerspace  
then we'll put the triangle on top  
but first I need some tape  
okay  
whoops  
sponge  
maybe we could make a rocketship out of this  
I have the tape right here  
what else  
well  oh  you should go peepee on the potty  
hm  
yeah  it's very damp  
you're very very damp  
we hafta get you some new pants  okay  
whoopsie whoopsie woo  
you forgot to go to the potty  Ethan  
you helped Tinky Winky go to the potty

I'm just gonna hook you up here  
hook ya up  
and you'll be all set all over again  okay  
the tape is right there  sweetie  it's a different kind of tape  
it's called masking tape  
mm  what do we wanna make out of that  
mm  
a telescope  
you could make a telescope out of that  
do I look bigger  
yeah  magnifying glass makes things look bigger 
and a telescope makes things look 
closer  closer  
yeah  you're right  
cause if you look at a star through a telescope 
it gets closer and bigger  
well  we have to wait til the stars come out  
and one day  when you get bigger  we'll go to the planetarium  
hoo hoo  
kinda like a wolf  
or a dog  howling at the moon  
woo hoo  
woo  
did work  
hoo woo  I think it was magic  
your pants are falling down  
I gotta sew your pants  
 
oop  those come off  
the bridge doesn't come off  no  
he's trying it  
 
look at those toes  
look at those toes  
 
he said quack quack right through the tube  
the towtruck  
the towtruck  
the towtruck's over there  
you want me to get the towtruck  
it's behind the camera  so I hafta get it  
just a plain old towtruck  
not really   no  he's a little confused  
a plain old towtruck  which means we have to find the plain old eyes  right  
uhoh  
oop  
there's the eye  
 
mhm  that's the way it goes  
very good  
they gotcha towtruck  
we've never found it  
it looks like  it matches  you see  
mkay  
 
to wiggle it  gently and slowly  
well there are the eyes  
that looks like a mouth  
mhm  
boing  boing  boing  
 that was a funny sound  
 
mhm  
okay  
mkay  
okay  you gotta put the firehydrant on the firetruck  that's a good idea  
mhm  
mkay  it looks like you need one more  right  
 wow  
that's neat  I like that truck  
mhm  it's kind of what it looks like to me  
could put that on top  couldn't you  
a fire circus truck  
they always say that  
 
no matter what kind of truck it is  it says there's a lot of work to do  
no  it's not  is it  
it's Ethan's special madeup superduper madeup truck  
what noise would a circus truck make  
 
that's what noise a circus truck would make  
 
aw  it honked his horn  
wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle  
the towtruck parts are all here  
you already did the towtruck before  
yep  he does  
I see it right there  
 
then he's towing something up  that's the sound as this goes up in the air  it goes  
but I think it's rope  
that's a new kind of towtruck  
mm a bunch more  
there's one more 
well  you gotta take the hat off I think  
there you go  
that looks like a circus truck again to me  
yeah  
circus truck needs a crazy hat  
I think the circus truck needs a silly circus hat  
you can put Pooh on the top  
your Pooh puppet  
that would kinda fall off  let's see  
Pooh looks like he is driving it  doesn't he  
maybe I know what we can do  
hm 
I know  here  
we could make him stick up in the air  like this  
watch this  
stuff him a little  
yeah  
hoo  
attach it better  
you pull and I'll pull  
you like it when it collapses  
okay  
he looks pretty big and fat  
mm  
just like this  hm  
looks like it's the special sliding truck  wee  
 
looks like he got stuck a little on the bottom  there we go  
mm  that's why  
woo  
he doesn't slide so well that way  does he  
he caught his arm on it  
to unhook his arm  
how do we get him out  
we will help out  
we hafta look for the other firefighter  huh  
the little guy  
there  nope  
he stand on his head  
oh to push him down   
uh  
he went right through  didn't he  that time  
who's gonna help him  
oop  
sorry  
or he can use his axe  
mhm  
no  whoops  here   
oop  he's stuck already  
a hat  
maybe he has lights on his hat  so he can go and see in dark places  
that's his walkietalkie right there  
oh  
oh  then it had one  yeah  
well now is a new day  Friday  different things happen  huh  
yeah  it's really windy out  
what did I change  the flower  
the flower just got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger  
the flower  
I didn't change it into anything  
it just grew and grew  
 into a flower patch  
well first it was very little and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger  
whoops  sorry  
it's a new day  
here's a little hill that they can climb up  
yeah  
wanna ride in the truck  
mhm  
but I don't know if it would fit  
whoops  
he fits on 
there we go  now he's on it  
mm  we need some hoses to put on the back and then it will be his  
two hoses  
okay  that's a good idea  here  
I have an idea  wrap it around here  
whoops  
and then  
yeah  when we take the dumper off it looks more like a firetruck  
hose number one is the red one  
that's pretty funny  
sometimes  lights flash on a firetruck and that could be the lights flashing  right  
should we actually make it go  
dya wanna make it go  
you have to make the sirens  
his hoses fell off  
you made a funny joke  
you said your firetrucks were gonna go  cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo  
that was a funny joke  
uhoh  
mm  
rushing to the fire  
uhoh  
it lost its hoses
