there's already an airplane here 
gonna do the loopdeloop 
maybe he has a friend airplane to play with 
where's Harold 
there he is 
no he's a helicopter 
one's an airplane one's a helicopter 
spin spin 
yep 
will you teach me how to do the loopdeloop 
what name shall we give this one 
this one says turboprop on it 
Turbo we'll call him Turbo 
for short 
can you show me how to do the loopdeloop 
mhm 
s h o o p 
down toward the ground 
and concentrate and then flip a little 
he says it's kind of like a somersault in the air 
now can you do it Turbo says Harold 
we'll do it the same time 
they both did loopdeloops 
he has no wings that's right 
we don't have any other planes with wings I don't think 
these are little mini propellers on the tips of his wings 
yep 
did he land in the pond 
you know what sheds are called for airplanes 
airplanes go to sleep in places called hangars 
they need their hangars 
oh you're gonna put them way in 
is the awake one making noise 
Harold is trying to sleep 
we could sing him a lullaby 
 
up 
the world 
like a 
in the 
twinkle 
little 
how I 
he could hang up right here 
 
who can read them a story that's a good question 
you want me to read them a story 
see what kind of story they might like to listen to 
mkay that's a good sleeping story except it doesn't make any sense 
cause the pages are out of order 
can you yawn 
ooh bed 
oop they're starting to fall asleep Ethan shh 
Po 
 
Po is riding her scooter 
scooter 
and then it says Dipsy is supposed to be in bed 
that doesn't make any sense cause this was about Po 
that's better 
oh sweetie 
that's a shape where nobody has been 
has gone for a walk with her 
what 
they're both what 
La La is supposed to be in bed 
oop you attaching the giraffe to the thing 
open the legs a little 
you got it 
now it's yeah now we should put one on this side 
you see that they have their tongues sticking out a little bit 
giraffes have very very very long tongues 
longer than yours 
longer than mine 
mhm they're looking at each other 
yes they do 
on the corner 
will it stay yeah it does stay 
probably the 
Turbo 
mhm he's flying between the two giraffes 
the space is wide enough 
if it was narrow 
then he might not be able to fly between them huh 
aw he flew between them 
that's a good trick Turbo 
you wanna make something 
you wanna build with blocks 
wanna play with playdough 
or clay 
or do a fingerpaint 
I think that's so he can hold onto scoop 
this bucket moves doesn't it 
no 
the big scoop is downstairs 
you're right it is a part of a d 
it's the inside part of the d 
you are slip sliding away 
what else is in there 
cause it looks a little bit like a pinwheel doesn't it 
 
uhhuh 
 do we still have a pinwheel 
so let's see your pinwheel 
we had one and it broke but I thought we had another one 
 
do you wanna do a fingerpainting 
somebody just sneezed 
who sneezed 
yes I remember that you sneeze like that 
yeah 
here ya wanna fingerpaint 
like that 
wanna build something 
Mr Potato Head be quiet 
the racing car parts 
very good 
it can go closer 
like that 
so I had the guy ready 
he's driving it fast 
careful you're gonna bump into the tripod 
you bumped right into the easel 
 
spaceship guys 
ya gonna play with your spaceship guys 
hm what's that 
some craters right 
to be on the planet I'm gonna take this Mr Potato Head guy outta here 
you wanna put some aliens on that planet 
popping out of the craters 
hoo there's an alien huh 
how can you make Mr Potato Head be quiet 
oh sweetie 
you're gonna really ruin that sweater 
achoo 
where's his spaceship 
where is the fire 
be careful it's hot 
underneath the spaceship yeah 
I think when it lands the fire goes away 
you want me to get you one of the astronauts 
 couple of times like this 
should we tie it around his arm 
oh that guy 
right this is just the alien 
there we go we'll attach it to his maybe his neck 
around his space helmet 
but he will never fly all too far cause he's attached 
so he is floating up up up up up up up up woo this is fun zero gravity is fun 
can he do high moon jumps 
on the 
we take off the 
we don't really have a moon mobile do we 
what can we use for a moon mobile 
the spaceship could float away too I guess in zero gravity 
bonk 
it might need some repairs here 
oops 
there we go 
yep 
that's where he belongs 
yep 
he has a space helmet just like these guys do 
I don't see the guy 
there's the girl 
you've got the earth and earth moon 
earth moon earth moon earth moon 
that was a good idea sweetie 
mhm 
a whole alien 
yeah a lot of the aliens are green aren't they 
they're the same size they have the same uniform but it's just a different color 
do they have their moon boots on 
yep silver moon boots 
it makes one fat spaceman 
a thick one 
well here's one guy 
the other one might have fallen out let's see 
nope so it might be in the basket over here 
a lot of the tools didn't make it in there 
and here's a tool bench 
mm 
what kind of tools do you have 
that's a good question 
is the hammer here 
hope 
ooh 
yeah we glued it on but I guess it didn't work very well 
yeah the glue didn't stay very well 
the right one 
you chopping why don't you chop the tree down 
whoops 
that's right 
to make it into lumber 
cause when you cut down a tree then you get logs and we have a log on your train table somewh 
 
you've got yourself a log now load it into the log car 
now it can go off to the sawmill 
make a building that can be the sawmill 
blocks of the same color 
 
we'll build a sawmill like that 
we can make a house or I was pretending to make a sawmill 
there 
nn 
can you tell what building that is 
a firestation right 
firetruck that belongs to the set 
yep 
and if the doors could open it would go right inside 
you open the doors 
it has the red crosses on it 
so the ambulance usually goes to the fire with the firefighters they drive together 
and they both have sirens don't they 
the siren is kinda yellow 
that one doesn't have one does it 
usually it's a red on an ambulance 
donchoo 
mm is it there 
oop 
yep 
and there red siren and a red light on top 
you wan you wanna make it stick inside 
I'll push in your direction and maybe you can stick it inside yourself 
can you reach 
whoops 
Harold doesn't open the doors anymore 
yeah if the hospital is broken 
but the doors to the hospital are broken 
I think we closed it shut tight too many times 
maybe we could fix it 
I see 
 
 
sometimes you use axes to pry things open 
 you'd rather chop the door open 
let's pry it together okay 
well done 
that was good 
are they feeling better now 
did they go to the hospital and now they feel better 
you think or are they still sick and they hafta go back to the hospital 
he's taking a long drive 
there's the guy 
mkay we got everything right here in this box 
need to take your racing car apart 
the racing car is right over there 
okay so it has 
that front 
maybe the front is this way 
that's the way it goes I think 
then you need the tail part 
now that goes 
ahhah 
let's see if we can figure this out 
we did it wrong 
so this goes 
there 
this hasta go over the wheel 
like that 
mhm perfect 
 
there you go whoops 
that's right 
I mean a propeller 
a little propeller on the back 
mm you go 
they go under water to look at all the fish that live deep down in the deep blue sea 
the ocean has a bottom so they can drive along the ocean floor maybe 
we all live in a yellow submarine 
it works perfectly 
we all live in a 
yellow submarine 
these are windows and I bet when the driver is done driving he goes inside the submarine and takes a nap 
yeah then he drives it takes a nap drives it takes a nap 
now we need a fish 
here's the crab 
yep it's a counting crab 
 he needs new batteries this crab 
that's why he sounded so funny 
you didn't play with him very much did you 
you missed some you hafta try to put your finger on every one 
one 
four 
five 
big pinchers 
whoops 
but you still didn't find the crab did you 
you wanna piece to do some finger painting on you can have a piece 
 
should we make your hand print on the paper 
mm we only have your stamp markers here 
we'll trace your hand 
mkay keep it flat 
 
okay ready 
oops you moved your finger I didn't finish 
whoop oop don't move 
 
I keep very still 
a big hand yeah 
draw the other fingers on it 
gotta hold this pen up for the ink to come out 
you're gonna break something 
whoops 
princess birthday fun clothes

let's see 
what's something happening with your fingernail yeah 
Teletubbies love books that's what it says 
no it doesn't say anything 
you did a lot of coloring on that one didn't you 
almost all the different colors there are 
bend and touch mouth
