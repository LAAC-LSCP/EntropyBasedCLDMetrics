 oop  
Thomas one and Thomas two fell down  
whoa  
I need to turn the light on  it's a little dark in here today  huh  
that's better

which one do you want  
the happy one  
that's the one you wanted  right  
hm   you wanna story  
this one  or this one  
 which one is this one  
or  better view for Gordon  
you were saying it yesterday  
what did the box say  
 
Cranky was unloading a box for Sir Topham Hatt  
the box was marked  urgent  
h u m p h  creaked Cranky  what's so urgent about this package  
Thomas heard Cranky's question  
if it says urgent  we should get it to Sir Topham Hatt as fast as we can  he said  
I'll take it  
just then  Gordon pulled up next to Thomas  
an urgent package needs a speedy train  said Gordon  I'm 
yup  he doesn't have it any more  
it must be on the docks here  
I'm the fastest train here  so I will have to take the package  
Gordon took the package and set off immediately  
Thomas was left behind  
I could have gotten it there quickly  he peeped  
Gordon hurried down the track and took a hilly shortcut  
suddenly  he saw a red signal  
some rocks had fallen across his path  
he was stuck  
just then  Toby came by on an open truck  
help  said Gordon  
I'll take it down the hill  said Toby  
thank you  
Gordon called as Toby chugged away  
Toby c l i c k e t y  c l a c k e d quickly down the hill  
what's that  
what's that  Ethan  
Percy was waiting at the bottom  
thank you for bringing the urgent package down  said Percy  
Sir Topham Hatt will be very proud of me  Percy tooted as he hurried along  
Percy rounded a bend and saw James ahead of him  pulling two troublesome trucks  
James was going very slowly  because the trucks had their brakes on  
they were trying to stop James  
they wouldn't go until they took the package  
Percy was very mad  
but he knew that the urgent package had to get to Sir Topham Hatt quickly  
with a sigh   he gave it to the trucks  
no more trouble from you  trucks  said James  
the trucks released their brakes  
James and the trucks quickly left Percy behind  
was Thomas listening to the story too  
James was glad he would be the one to deliver this urgent package now  
James was going so fast  he almost didn't see 
what is it  Ethan  
the broken track  
now Sir Topham Hatt will never get his urgent package  
I'll take the urgent package  said Harold  landing next to James  
Harold soared over the countryside  
he looked down  and saw Thomas pulling in  into Tidmouth station  
Thomas had been faster than Gordon after all  
where's my package  Sir Topham Hatt said  
just then  Harold landed  
I have it  sir  he said  
and he told Thomas and Sir Topham Hatt what happened  
finally  Sir Topham Hatt opened the urgent package  
it's a shiny new hat  
just in time for tonight's big party  Sir Topham Hatt said  putting the hat on his head  
and Thomas  next time there is an urgent package 
I want you to bring it  
which one  
Thomas the tank engine  rolling along  
he is the one  he is the one  
Thomas we love you  
yep  
I'm a little choochoo train  chuggin down the track  
now I'm going forward  now I'm going back  
and then we know  engine engine number nine 
that's Douglas  that's right  
or Donald  
engine engine number nine  going down Chicago line  
jump  the track  
do you want your money back  
will you get your money back  
yes  no  a maybe so  
yes  no  a maybe so  
it's a design  an what's that  Ethan  
an what's this design  
when engineers get hot  they use this to wipe their face  
that's why they carry a kerchief  
it's called a kerchief  
remember  we read about a handkerchief  
 I don't know  
that's right  
so they can wipe their faces when it gets hot  
or wipe their 
cause sometimes you get dusty when you drive a train  
your pants are falling down  huh  
 looks like Cranky's holding up the name of the book  an the name of the book is  the special delivery  
that's cute  
he's holding up the name of the book  
that's the urgent package  
are you sleepy today  
 
you got up very early  
  wanna read another one  
up  out of the way  so you can relax  Max  
I mean Ethan  
I mean Max  
I mean Ethan  
he looks  what does he look  there  
tired  
shall we read this one  too  
Toby and the flood  
it had been raining hard for weeks  
Toby was feeling miserable  
everywhere was 
wet  
wet  
wet  
that's a dam  
an the water's coming through  
it's like a big wall  an the water is pouring through  
only the great wall  known as a dam  was stopping the water from overflowing  
Percy arrived just as Toby was about to expect the dam for any damage  
driver tells me it may be dangerous up there  careful Toby  
I'll try  said Toby bravely  
Percy watched anxiously as Toby trundled away  
there he goes  over that bridge  
the river surged dangerously beneath it  
just like in the 
the  um  what story  
about the tugboat  
Scuffy  
Harold the Helicopter was inspecting the dam as Toby arrived  
be brave  Toby  called his driver  
the dam did not look safe at all  and Toby was worried  
it broke  
the dam's breaking up  
Toby shunted back as fast as his wheels would let him  
the river had risen so high that the bridge was in danger of collapsing  
the dam's breaking up  we must find high ground  
shouted Toby's driver  
your only chance is to cross the bridge  called Toby  
called Percy  
Thomas  look at it break up like that  an the water's rushing through  
it's our only chance  said his driver  
we'll be 
Toby was halfway across when disaster struck  
we'll follow him on our line  
as Toby floated helplessly in the flood waters  they passed a sign that made them shudder  
what does it say  
if we go over that waterfall  we're 
then they saw Harold  who slooped  
you're a tired little pumpkin today  huh  
let's see  
and they did  
just then  Percy arrived  
Harold flew over to him  
catch the rope and pull Toby to safety  
he called  
an he's attached to a rope  
oof  
when the floods were over and the dam mended  the villagers had a big party for Toby  hosted by Sir Topham Hatt  
you were very brave  Toby  
oh  I'm sure you would be  
Percy rather hoped he would never have to  
what story's this  
Gordon was feeling grumpy  
why are you complaining all the time  
because I'm a big engine and I know everything  
I shall complain whenever I want  
I can't see any  said Percy  where are they  
any what  
like your smokebox  Percy  
laughed James  
one day I'll show you just what a big engine can really do  
not speak to silly little green 
then he puffed away  
later that day  Sir Topham Hatt came to see him  
Gordon  you'll be making one stop today  with an empty express  to test our new station  
you can make up time afterwards  
why can't Henry do it  
you will do as you are told  
so Gordon did  but he was still unhappy  
an he grew sick  too  
Gordon was sick  
he's making a funny face  
I can't do it   
do I look like Gordon  
 you look funny too  
I just can't get up to speed  he moaned  
your pipes are clogged  said the fireman  
at last  they approached the new station  
Gordon was impressed  but his mood soon changed  
in front of him was a blank wall an huge buffers  
what a boring view  
important engines like me should have a panoramic view  where I can see people and people can see me  
and he w e e s h e d angrily   
w e e s h  
Gordon was happy when it was time to leave  
now you can really enjoy your run  as long as your pipes will let you  said his driver  
come on  come on  I can go faster than this  puffed Gordon  
sick  
but Gordon began to feel more and more feeble  
that means weak  
what happened  
his driver and his fireman inspected him  
now you really will have to go to the works  
Gordon was still angry when James arrived to collect his cookies  
well  well  well  
you got too puffed up in your boiler  so it serves you right  
serves you right  serves you right  
when Gordon returned from the works a few days later  he was still boasting  
I am the finest engine on the island of Sodor  
probably the finest in the world  
come on  Gordon  we're going to the new official opening of the station  
then there was trouble  
as Gordon approached the station  
the driver reduced steam  but Gordon was still going too fast  
help me  please  
well  Gordon  said Sir Topham Hatt  I knew you wanted a panoramic view  but this is not the way to achieve it  
what did Gordon say  
when Gordon was repaired again  he took Sir Topham Hatt to the new station for its second official opening  
this time he arrived safely  an everyone clapped and cheered as he pulled in  
you don't wanna finish the story  
 you want  something about  not about Thomas  
 Blue goes to school

an this little engine that could is made out of plastic  
ready  
oop  backwards  
your engineer's uniform
