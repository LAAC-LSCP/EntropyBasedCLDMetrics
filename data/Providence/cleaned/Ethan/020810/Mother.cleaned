 she was mowing the lawn

Poppleton was mowing the lawn

you're right  throwing snowballs

snow pig  
who's on top

Hudson  yep  
what's he doing there  
 I think he's shoveling the snow  yeah  
 
Poppleton's house grew very long icicles in the winter  
you're right  in Poppleton the Pig there were no icicles cause it was spring or summer  
 was hot out  
and it has to be cold to have icicles  
Poppleton was proud of them  
mhm  
he just let them get longer and longer  
who's Gus  
right  the mail carrier said  Poppleton you should do something about those icicles  
who's that  
that's right  
and when Poppleton's mother visited she said that an icicle was surely going to 
bonk him on the head  
what  
he has a ruler to measure them  
he loved his icicles  
that's different  
that's like Rolly huh  
this is a ruler  
ruler  
 
that's right  he wasn't watching where he was going  
and he ran into one icicle  
and that one 
fell into 
which 
fell into 
which 
fell into 
which fell into 
huh
