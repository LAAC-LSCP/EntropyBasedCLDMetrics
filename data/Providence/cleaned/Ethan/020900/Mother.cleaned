the drawbridge is down 
so that the trains traveling on this track can go through cause the bridge is too short so the drawbridge has to lift up 
yep 
and when it goes up the train can pass through 
uhoh 
yep a lot of track is missing 
there's only a little bit of track there 
we can add some more track this way 
yep

right 
well there's no room for the track to go anywhere 
edge of the train table
