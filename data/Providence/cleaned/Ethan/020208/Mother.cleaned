once upon a time they were three little pigs 
they lived together in an old house 
on top of a tall hill 
huh 
along with seventy three other pigs 
that's a lot of pigs 
look how crowded it is 
mhm 
which is why 
they decided to leave home and 
build their own little houses 
the first little pig built his house out of straw 
bundles of straw 
the second little pig built his house out of sticks 
the third little pig built his house out of bricks 
bricks would keep out the wind 
the rain and the big bad wolf 
it's not good no he's bad he's a bad wolf 
the first little pig had just finished building his house when he heard a splash 
oops said a voice from no where in particular I spilled my juice
