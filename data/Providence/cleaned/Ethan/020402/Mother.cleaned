so they each can sleep in the dark  
mm now put that over Butch  
here we go  
one for each of them  
there we go  
nobody can see them and they can't see anybody  
Diesel was curious about all the blankets over the tracks  
he said  
wake up time  
Terence comes in  yep

did you sleep well  
not a wink  
said Trevor
