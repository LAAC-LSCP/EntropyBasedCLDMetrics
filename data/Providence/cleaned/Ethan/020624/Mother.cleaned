we can build a town for your cars 
wanna do that 
not too set you're set up you're set up 
now I have to get set up 
but if you want you can sit outside in the back there's an umbrella table and it's actually kinda peaceful out there and cool 
but it's up to you 
I'll show ya 
careful Eth 
let's not touch the 
tripod 
let's not touch the tripod 
so if you um 
if you wanna do that 
I don't know how cool the living room is 
I'll just show ya quickly 
just go through that back screen door back there 
it might be locked 
you just have to pull it off 
and the table's to your left 
do we have em all 
hm 
where's Shane 
where's the newest one we got 
what was the newest one Ethan 
what was his na 
oh the Truckbot 
where's your Truckbot 
no I can't twirl 
I can twirl a little 
yeah I can twirl all the way 
and go up and down 
it's hard to do huh 
it doesn't move very easily 
let's load up 
the milk truck with the milk 
he's the other one with a different name 
and 
and then you have Tucker 
Tucker the Truckbot except I don't know where he is 
he may have disappeared somewhere 
you wanna build a city 
should we build a city for the cars to drive through 
what 
yeah 
so they can drive through 
let's put up all the buildings okay 
we'll make a lot of buildings 
there's the school 
yeah we'll make New York city 
help me 
New York city has lotsof buildings 
and the trucks can drive right through 
on the street 
and there're some trees in the town too 
New York city has some trees in between the buildings 
make more buildings 
how do we do that 
the building fell down on top of the milk truck 
New York city 
that's a New York city disaster 
if the building fell on top of the milk truck 
and then you know what happened the milk spilled everywhere 
I'm gonna make some little houses too 
think that's Harold's house 
is that Harold's window 
could that be Harold's window 
are you building some houses 
you putting the roof on like George in the book we read 
he was a construction worker too 
here's a different color house 
yeah 
could be a multicolored house and then you could make a tall house 
our house is pretty tall 
this beige house is pretty tall 
here's the police station 
and you have a sheriff's truck they work out of the police station too sheriff's trucks 
that's the police station it says police station on 
we could build a really tall house 
hm there are lotsof bushes yeah 
in front of the house 
right next to the house 
right in front 
Harold and the purple crayon let's see if I can find it 
that's your favorite story huh 
it's a brown book here it is 
yeah it's a brown book 
whoops 
got a little bent 
it's 
yeah and purple together 
wan sit on my lap 
sit next to me 
yep 
you want your bottle 
where did I put it 
oh I put it up here 
you're sleepy huh 
I have my drink 
you have your drink 
Harold and the purple crayon 
one evening 
after thinking it over for some time 
Harold decided to go for a walk in the 
moonlight 
there wasn't any moon 
and Harold 
needed a moon oh 
needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight 
and he needed something to walk on 
he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost 
and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him 
there it is 
but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path 
so he left the path for a shortcut across a field 
and the moon went with him 
the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought to be 
he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest with 
just one tree in it 
that's right 
it turned out to be an 
yep 
the apples would be very tasty Harold thought when they got red 
so he put a 
yep a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples 
it was a terrible frightening dragon 
it even frightened Harold he backed away 
his hand holding the purple crayon 
shook 
yep 
suddenly he realized 
that's right he's falling right into the water 
by then Harold was over his head 
mhm 
just like you were in the ocean the other day 
he came up thinking fast 
thinking fast and thinking big heh 
he's thinking a lot yep 
he has to 
protect himself 
and in no time at all he was climbing aboard a 
a trim little boat 
he quickly set sail 
and the moon sailed along with him 
mhm 
and what did he draw 
mhm 
the sailboat 
after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without much trouble 
he stepped ashore on the beach 
mhm 
wondering where he was 
where was he 
right 
the sandy beach reminded Harold of 
yep picnics 
and the thought of picnics made him hungry so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch what was his lunch 
yep lotsof pies 
there was nothing but pie 
but they were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best 
when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left 
he hated so to see so much pie go to waste so Harold left 
yep the moose is gonna eat the pie up and what is the other animal he left 
a porcupine a deserving porcupine to finish it up 
and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was 
mhm a moose and a porcupine they're gonna finish up all the pie 
Harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see 
so he decided to make the hill into a 
yep mountain 
if he went high enough he thought he could see the window of his bedroom 
he was tired and he felt he ought to be getting to bed 
he hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain 
but what happened 
as he looked down over the other side he 
yep he slipped 
and there wasn't any other side of the mountain he was falling in 
thin air but luckily 
right he kept his wits and his purple crayon 
he made a balloon and he grabbed on to it 
and he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in 
he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window 
no I can see your window right over there right over there too 
you have two windows in your bedroom 
we can see the moon out that window 
at night 
he couldn't even see a house 
so he made a house 
with windows 
two houses yup 
looks like your house 
none of the windows was his window 
he tried to think where his window ought to be 
he made some more windows 
he made a big building full of windows 
he made lotsof buildings full of windows 
he made a whole city full of windows 
it does look like New York City and there's the moon it's still there 
but none of the windows was his window 
he couldn't think where it might be 
he decided to ask a policeman 
the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway 
but Harold thanked him 
he followed the way 
and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in bed 
you gonna walk straight to your bed 
then suddenly Harold remembered 
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon 
going to your bed 
just like Harold did 
the purple and brown book that's what color it is 
mixed up 
 
like your color and like your eyes are a little bit blue 
and a little bit green 
now this book is a lot brown and some purple 
a different color purple 
that's a color purple and that's a different color purple 
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon it was always right around the moon 
that's right 
we're both wearing stripes Ethan 
my shirt is stripy and your shirt is stripy 
and then we would have a new stripy shirt 
and then Harold made his bed 
he got in it 
and he drew up the covers 
the purple crayon dropped on the floor and Harold dropped off to sleep 
 
year after year after year after year 
ear after ear and year after year 
oh here's my ponytail holder
