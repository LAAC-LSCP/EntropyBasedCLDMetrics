but suddenly she heard a cough  
well he got a cough he has a lil tickle in his throat and he has a cough and his throat hurts him a lil bit  
so he's coughing  
there sat Sam curled up and small and coughing in his bed  
Mrs Bear put her arms around Sam don't you feel well Sam  
Sam shook his head  
poor Sam  
Mrs Bear hugged him harder and kissed his warm cheek  
you have a cough she said and she dashed down the stairs and up again with 
syrup  
open wide Sam she said Sam shook his head  
it tastes bad he said  
yes said his mom but you need to be brave  
Sam put the blanket on his head I don't have a cough

the spoon was too big too big said Sam

Mrs Bear rubbed frost off the window and peaked outside soon it will snow she said  
open wide Sam and we'll go downstairs and wait for snow

Sam opened wide then very wide he sputtered and snorted and made a big face and the syrup went down

Mrs Bear and Sam held hands on the stairs  
Sam wore his robe that was blue and his slippers were too

Sam leaned back on his mommy soft belly and it wriggled while she talked  
a little fire glowed and the kitchen was warm all through the night Mrs Bear and Sam sat in the big purple chair and waited  
and finally it snowed

what other book do you wanna read you wanna go get another one  
you wanna go get it  
why don't we pick another book out and we'll look for Dora  
okay bring it over sweets  
come sit with me  
oh boy look what we have  
Dora's backpack and the little mermaid which one should we read first  
alright the little mermaid  
wow  
mommy has to yawn she's tired  
under the sea was a bustling kingdom of merpeople presided over by the just and noble king 
king Tritan forbade the merpeople to go above the water but whenever his youngest daughter Ariel could she and her best friend Flounder would sneak up the surface  
Ariel was fascinated by the surface world and had a collection of human treasures  
she and Flounder had even made friends with a seagull named Scuttle  
one day Ariel saw a ship overhead and swam to the surface  
on board was a handsome young man called 
prince Eric  
all of a sudden a storm broke and the sky turned dark thunder boomed and lightening crashed  
howling wind tore at the ship's sails and giant waves tossed the vessel onto the jagged rocks  
prince Eric was thrown into the ocean  
Ariel frantically searched for the prince and when she spotted him she quickly swam over to him and pulled him to safety  
once they were on shore Ariel sang quietly to the unconscious prince  
at last he began to awaken minutes later the prince's servant sir Grimsby discovered him a girl rescued me said the prince groggily and she had the most beautiful voice  
yeah  
who else likes to sing  
who's that  
is she nice or is she mean  
meanwhile in a dark corner of the sea lay the lair of Ursula the sea witch she had been bent on destroying king Tritan ever since he had thrown her out of his kingdom  
she stared at the image of Ariel and Flounder in her crystal ball this pretty little daughter of his may be the key to Tritan's undoing she said  
when Ariel returned home Tritan was very angry with her  
that is his triton he holds  
and he destroyed all of Ariel's human treasures Ariel had that Ariel had collected from the surface  
 
Ariel was very upset and she sought Ursula's help  
in exchange for the mermaid's voice Ursula would transform Ariel's tail into legs  
but she said the prince must fall in love with you by sunset on the third day that is he's got to kiss you  
and if prince Eric didn't kiss her on the third day Ariel would change back into a mermaid and become Ursula's slave forever  
a short time later prince Eric and his dog Max found Ariel on the beach  
you seem very familiar to me he said have we met  
Ariel could only nod although she looked like the girl who had rescued him it Eric thought it couldn't be her because she couldn't speak much less sing  
don't worry I'll help you said Eric and he brought Ariel back to his castle  
but meanwhile Ursula hatched a plan to keep Eric from falling in love with Ariel she turned herself into a pretty girl named 
Vanessa right  
and she wore the shell containing Ariel's voice around her neck  
that evening the prince heard someone singing it was the voice of the girl who had saved him  
Eric went out to the balcony and saw Vanessa and fell under her wicked spell  
when Ariel awoke the next morning she saw Eric with Vanessa  
Ariel had lost her chance and was doomed to be Ursula's slave forever  
that's Deborah going to work  
aboard the wedding ship Scuttle saw Vanessa's reflection in the mirror and realized it was really Ursula  
Scuttle and the other seagulls did their best to interrupt the wedding by flying at Vanessa  
um  
this is one the ship  
um that looks like a little flower or something and this is some smoke maybe  
oh that's right that's the necklace that broke you're absolutely right  
I'll call her back  
um you can talk said prince you're the one it was you all the time  
happy at last the prince leaned over to kiss Ariel but seconds before the kiss the sun set  
you're too late shouted Ursula Ariel looked down and saw that her legs had changed back into a tail  
it's not you I'm after said Ursula I've got bigger fish to fry  
and at those words king Tritan appeared  
in return for his daughter's freedom the king agreed to take Ariel's place as Ursula's slave  
that's Ariel's daddy's crown and his triton  
Ursula grew monstrously huge but suddenly prince Eric appeared steering his ship through the raging waves right at Ursula  
and the bough of the ship pierced her cold heart slowly the horrible sea witch sank beneath the waves forever  
king Tritan's powers were restored and he realized how happy Eric and Ariel were  
with his triton he changed Ariel's tail back into legs  
yay  
mm  
hm  
what's what's this one about  
Belle  
and who's that  
the beast  
a young woman named Belle lived near the castle  
Belle loved to read more than anything in the world  
who else loves to read  
you do like to read  
uh her father Maurice was busy working on a new invention you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow Belle predicted  
but Maurice and his horse Philippe never made it to the fair they got lost and saw a castle  
Maurice approached the castle and stepped inside  
suddenly a huge beast stormed into the room a stranger he gravled growled and dragged Maurice into the dungeon  
at that very moment Gaston a local hunter had arrived at Belle's house to propose marriage  
say you'll marry me he said but Belle refused there was no way she'd marry that conceited bully  
Gaston left angrily  
just then Philippe arrived with no rider where's papa  
I don't suppose she's French so maybe she just said where's papa huh  
Belle rode through the forest braving the thick fog and frightening sounds when she found the castle  
that's right  
take me instead of my father said Belle  
you can go anywhere you like he said to Belle except the west wing and you will join me for dinner  
back at the castle the beast waited for Belle to join him for dinner master said Lumiere this girl could be the one to break the spell  
she'll always see me as a monster grumbled the beast  
but one day at dinner the beast remembered his manners and later he and Belle shared a wonderful dance  
the beast asked Belle if she was happy  
oh yes said Belle if only I could see my father  
so the beast brought Belle a magic mirror and her father appeared in it  
but he was wondering lost in the forest you must go to him said the beast sadly but take the mirror so you can remember me  
she left the castle and found her father and brought him home  
but suddenly Gaston arrived with an angry crowd your father's crazy he think thinks he's seen a beast  
but Belle had to convince everyone her father was not crazy so she picked up the magic mirror and showed the beast to the crowd  
she's in her house  
Belle and her father escaped from the cellar and also began riding towards the castle  
when Belle and her father arrived the beast had Gaston by the throat  
let me go cried Gaston and the beast felt sorry for him and released him  
that's right they are wearing capes  
hm  
as the beast embraced Belle Gaston stabbed him in the back and the beast let out a terrible roar  
Gaston tripped and fell off the balcony and was never to be seen again  
the beast collapsed in Belle's arms you came back he said at least I got to see you one more time  
Belle began to cry  
oh no please said Belle I love you  
and at Belle's words the beast became human again  
it's me he said to Belle and all the household servants became human too  
the spell was broken at last
