and says I'm gonna make my magic stone soup and he puts a big pot of water with this stone in it 
and the people are very interested so he says 
well if you'd like to share my stone soup you can bring something small to put into the soup  
so someone brings carrots 
and someone brings celery 
and someone brings onion 
and someone brings barley 
and they all put something yummy into the soup and it cooks and cooks with the magic stone and at the end it tastes so delicious and they all share the soup together
