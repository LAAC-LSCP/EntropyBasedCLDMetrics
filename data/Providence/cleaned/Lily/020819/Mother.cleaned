got it  
so many things to do  
you're a busy busy girl  
okay  
every day  Cinderella woke up early to do chores for her stepmother and stepsisters  
from morning to night  she  they gave her things to do  
but the birds and mice were Cinderella's friends  and helped her with her work  
one morning  a messenger came from the palace to invite Cinderella and her stepsisters to a royal ball  
oh  a little bird wearing a pink hat  
Cinderella was very excited  but her stepmother gave her a long list of chores to do before she could go  
while Cinderella was busy working  the birds and mice began fixing an old dress that had belonged to Cinderella's mother  
before long  they made Cinderella a beautiful gown  
by the time Cinderella finished her chores  she thought it was too late to get ready for the ball 
and was very sad  
surprise  the birds and mice gave Cinderella the finished gown  
oh  thank you so much  she said  
Cinderella got dressed and rushed to join her stepsisters  but when they saw her they became so jealous they tore her lovely gown to pieces  
that wasn't very nice  
Cinderella ran to the garden and wept  
just then  sparkling lights swirled all around  
 it was her 
who is that  
dry those tears  she said  you can't go to the ball looking like that  
with a wave of her magic wand  the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown  
and with one more wave  Cinderella had tiny glass slippers on her feet  
before Cinderella left for the ball  she received a warning  
on the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken and everything will be as before  
that night at the ball  the prince met Cinderella  and without knowing each other's names  they danced and danced until the clock struck midnight  
I must go  Cinderella cried  
and as she fled  she lost a 
the next day  the prince announced he wanted to marry the girl who had lost her glass slipper  
when the wicked stepmother realized it was Cinderella who was the prince's favorite  she locked Cinderella in her room  
let me out  Cinderella cried  
the grand duke went to every home in the kingdom looking for the maiden whose foot fit the tiny glass shoe  
Cinderella's little friends took the key out of the stepmother's pocket and slipped it under Cinderella's door just in time  
when the grand duke put the slipper on Cinderella's foot 
soon after  Cinderella and the prince were married  and they lived happily ever after  
that one  oh  look who that is  
that's Snow white  
long ago  there lived a lovely princess named Snow white  
oh  she's wearing a blue bow in her hair  
Snow white's stepmother  the queen  was jealous of Snow white's beauty  
each day the queen would ask  magic mirror on the wall  who's the fairest one of all  
and the mirror would always answer  you are  
one day the mirror said  a lovely maid I see  who is more fair than thee  
the queen knew  it must be Snow white  
Snow white was so beautiful and kind  that even a handsome prince who was passing by soon noticed her  
little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow white  the evil queen was watching nearby  
Snow white realized she must leave home or risk being hurt by the queen  
Snow white was so frightened that she ran deep into the forest  
do you know where I can stay  she asked a group of friendly animals  
what kind of animals are there  
chipmunks  
the animals led Snow white to a tiny cottage in the woods  
it's like a doll's house  she said  
she knocked on the door but no one answered  
so she slowly stepped inside  
Snow white found seven tiny bowls  seven tiny chairs  and seven tiny beds  
but the cottage was a mess  
oh my  there must be seven tiny children living here  
let's clean the house and surprise them  she said to the animals  
and then maybe they'll let me stay  
soon seven tiny men arrived  the seven dwarves  
Snow white promised to wash and sew and sweep for the little men  
in return  they kept her safe and happy  
the seven dwarfs loved having Snow white stay in their cottage  
back at the castle  the magic mirror told the queen where Snow white was hiding  
the queen was so angry that she drank a potion and turned herself into an old hag  
and then she created a magic apple  
with one bite of this poisoned apple  Snow white's eyes will close forever  
the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss  
as soon as the dwarves went to work  the queen  disguised as a peddler woman  approached Snow white  
the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarves  
but by the time the dwarves arrived  it was too late  
oh my  
the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarves raced after her and chased her to a rocky cliff  
well  the seven dwarves are nice  they're just angry  
a rock broke beneath her feet and the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below
