the night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind 
his mother called him wild thing and Max said I'll eat you up  
so he was sent to bed without eating anything  
that very night in Max's room a forest grew  
and grew 
and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and his walls became the world all around  
and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through night and day  
what's he doing  
and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are  
and when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and they gnashed their terrible teeth and they rolled their terrible eyes and they showed their terrible claws  
 
do you think they're scary  
till Max said be still  
and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once  
and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all  
that's a chicken wild thing  
do you see any other 
oh yes  
you're right  
and now  cried Max  let the wild rumpus begin  
and they danced by the light of the moon  
and they hung from the trees  
and they had their wild thing parade  
now stop Max said  and sent the wild things to bed without their supper  
and Max  the king of all wild things  was lonely  
and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all  
and all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat  
but the wild things cried oh please don't go  we'll eat you up we love you so  
the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws  
but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye  
byebye  
and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day 
and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him  
and it was still 
very good
