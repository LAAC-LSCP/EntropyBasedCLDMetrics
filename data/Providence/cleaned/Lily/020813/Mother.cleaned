Mommy loves that book  
you do love Frog and Toad you're right that is one of your favorites  
oh this one that's what a friend is  
I'm like every time I've ever taken like my S A Ts my G R Es everything I'm like I'm an English major and my math always ends up higher than my English which is not to say my math is astronomically high but I'm like what happened  
it used to be math verbal and analytical but I think it's different now isn't it  
jeez  
a friend is a listener who will always be there when you've got a big secret you just hafta share  
a friend is a sidekick who'll sit by your side to make you feel better when you're troubled inside  
and when there's nothing to do on a wet rainy day a friend is a pal who'll come over to play  
friends are just perfect for all kinds of things  
like walking or talking or swinging on swings  
and for watching tv a friend is the best  
for cheering cartoons with and booing the rest  
and then late at night a friend is just right  
for telling ghost stories when you've turned off the light  
yes a friend is the best one to hop skip or run with  
for playing some catch or just having fun with  
they're running aren't they  
you can sing and shout til your tonsils wear out  
cause that's what having a friend's all about  
a friend is a buddy who'll come to your aid  
when he thinks you need help or you might be afraid  
a friend is a partner who'll stand back to back  
to protect you from bullies or a monster attack  
with a friend you can do what you most like to do  
you can have your own hideouts in dark secret places  
or spend the whole day having caterpillar races  
what's that  
can I see  
looks like it came out of a puzzle or something  
little pink circle  
whoopsie sorry  
you can laugh you can cry you can watch cars go by  
sorry or just drawing pictures of each other's faces  
you can laugh you can cry you can watch cars go by  
you can have a great time and not even try  
a friend is a person who likes to be there  
cause you two make a wonderful pair
