okay  
kay see you later  
I just put the heat on there  I don't know why 
last night the house was eighty degrees and now of course it's sixty degrees  we can't seem 
like what do you mean you had the heat and the air conditioning on  
just trying to regulate  
watch her little  um  you know we the cds to watch on the computer sometimes and they see her like you know and 
she  she used to stand in the middle of that green room and stare at the bookcase 
this is what you used to do when you were little  
she would just talk to herself  
cause it means like pooping  
and do you remember honey when you were little and your Manuela used to come  
she has a friend who has a nanny named Manuela so was always like my Manuela does this and your Manuela does that  
oh we love Manuela don't we  
so the whale comes in in kind of like a car wash and then these fish clean the whales off  
neat huh  
he looks like he needs a tooth brushing too doesn't he  
Oscar is a little fish with big dreams  
one day 
his lucky day 
he's going to be at the top of the  
but until then he's working at the whale wash  
Angie is Oscar's best friend  
her job is to answer the phone  
is whale wash  you get a whale of a wash  and the price  oh my gosh  
when Oscar gets to work 
the whale wash starts thumping and the soap suds start pumping  
the turtles get to work twirling on the wax when Oscar turns up the music with the volume to the max  
the eels have the sparks to keep the current glowing  
oh see they're lighting up so everyone can see  
intensified  electrified  they keep the groove aflowing  
the whales keep on moving through each and every station and the fish crew keeps on cleaning 
while dancing in formation  
that is one dirty whale huh  
Angie is in the office  
she twists and shakes her fins  
while Gino cleans the blow hole  
hey those look like stingrays don't they  
the scrubbers fall in line dancing side by side  
picking up the groove and scrubbing as they glide  
the crabs leap from bungee cords snapping with their claws removing all the barnacles from the whales' scaly jaws  
where did we see the barnacles  
inside the the whale's mouth is dirty and green and slimy  
so Oscar works his magic to make it nice and shiny  
Johnson is the dj way up in the booth  
he keeps the music pumping while Oscar turns it loose  
Oscar may be a little fish but he's turning up the heat  
he's got the whale wash working to the O s c a r l i c i o u sp beat
