remember what this one's called 
what's it called 
and the beast 
long ago an enchantress cast a spell on a castle and she transformed the handsome young prince into a hideous beast 
and his servants into household objects 
just look at me grumbled the beast I've been so cruel holding Belle captive in my castle how will she ever see me as anything but a monster 
come now said Mrs Pots gently all you hafta do is show her what's inside your heart you must act like a gentleman Lumiere said 
be romantic compliment her and most of all be kind gentle and sincere 
and don't be so grumpy added Chip Mrs Pots young son 
Mrs Pots gave her son a stern look but they all knew Chip was right 
who's that 
Lumiere 
I have an idea said the beast smiling why don't I invite Belle to go on a sleigh ride 
it just snowed outside and she might like the fresh air 
perfect said Lumiere a wonderful idea agreed Mrs Pots 
added Chip that's enough out of you Mrs Pots said to Chip trying not to smirk 
the beast Lumiere to extend his invitation 
that sounds lovely said Belle I've been stuck in this castle far too long 
she ran down the long staircase and stepped outside 
glimmering white snow flakes fell from the sky it was a perfect white day 
just then the beast pulled up in a gleaming horse drawn sleigh 
how beautiful exclaimed Belle 
the beast smiled as he took her hand and helped her into the sleigh 
he didn't mention he had slept all morning polishing it just for her 
once she was settled he covered her with a warm blanket 
they took off across the powdery snow Belle laughed happily as the beast guided the sleigh through the forest path 
soon they came to a clearing in the woods before then was a frozen pond 
the beast pulled on the reins and stopped at the the edge of the pond 
this is such a magical place said Belle how did you ever find it 
I used to come here long ago said the beast it was one of y favorite places and I wanted to share it with you 
then the beast took out a picnic basket filled with snacks 
what are they eating 
they have hot chocolate 
that sounds like a good snack doesn't it 
when they had finished their meal the beast asked Belle if she wanted to ice skate 
oh yes she said father and I used to go every winter I love ice skating 
soon Belle was spinning effortlessly across the pond's smooth surface 
the beast was less graceful hitting a bump in the ice he lost his balance and toppled to the ground 
at first he was angry but then he saw Belle looking at him kindly 
remembering his friends' advice he smiled as Belle helped him to his feet 
every one falls sometimes said Belle it's part of learning 
before long they were gliding across the ice arm in arm enjoying each other's company in the crisp winter air 
they grew tired and decided to rest 
just then a timid fawn wandered out of the forest 
poor thing said Belle she looks scared and hungry 
taking an apple from their picnic basket Belle showed the beast how to gently feed the young deer 
soon the sun was setting it was time to go as they made their way home Belle thought about the day she had spent with the beast 
there was something different about him he had shown her a kinder softer side 
perhaps they could be friends after all 
is that what comes next 
what's this one called 
right is it called the dance lesson 
how do you ask nicely 
just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince 
and every maiden in the land is invited 
that means me too 
all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around 
they loved their Cinderella 
oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do 
I can only go if I finish my chores 
and today step mother has given me more work than ever 
there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping 
suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs 
Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball he step sisters cried 
mend my dress polish my shoes iron my cloak 
hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor 
suddenly Jacques had an idea 
I know he said we'll help Cinderella and all the other mice nodded in agreement 
what would I do without you Cinderella said patting them on the head you're so good to me 
everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went 
as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead 
everyone would be dressed in the the finest clothes Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown 
the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the handsome young prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance 
suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming oh no she said I've never been to a ball I don't even know how to dance 
don't worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly 
we'll show you how to dance easy as pie 
with that Jacques bowed before Perla and extended his hand 
dance please he asked Perla blushed as she took Jaques' hand 
Gus was the conductor he got all the birds to sing 
Jacques and Perla spun around and around gliding across the floor 
honey is the mouse's name Jack or Jacques 
it's Jacques and Gus 
Cinderella watched and then copied their movements 
just listen and move see said Perla not so scary 
using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went 
good Cinderella said Jacques beaming a lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderelli 
and the mice collapsed on the floor laughing thank you so much Cinderella said to her friends 
with your help tonight might be the night all my dreams come true 
it is Ariel next look at that 
a special surprise 
is Ariel swimming 
who's she swimming with 
flounder wow 
are they friends 
please 
the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful 
every mermaid and merman were in bed fast asleep 
everyone but princess Ariel and her friend flounder 
hurry up flounder cried Ariel it's almost time for the party we can't be late 
trying not to make a sound Ariel and flounder swam away from king Triton's palace 
they began their journey towards the surface but Ariel said flounder are you sure we should go to the surface 
remember the last time your father got so angry 
you know how he feels about humans 
that's why this time 
oh you need blankie o o p y 
got it 
yes 
prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a ship wreck was having a royal ball 
Ariel had a very special surprise for him 
swim faster flounder she cried flounder raced to keep up 
just as Ariel and flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water 
when they poked their heads out of the water Ariel and flounder saw colorful lights explode in the air above prince Eric's castle 
I've never seen anything so beautiful in all my life said Ariel 
the human world is a wonderful place 
sure is pretty said flounder 
do you think prince Eric is happy 
think he's sad 
he's happy oh good 
off in the distance prince Eric stood on the palace balcony 
he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life in the ship wreck 
why has she disappeared he wondered 
 
flounder spotted the prince first 
look Ariel he said 
Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw prince Eric 
it's time for my surprise she said winking at flounder 
swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and flounder hid behind it 
ready asked flounder 
with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing 
do you need me to get blankie honey 
the ground 
gosh what's he doing on the ground 
you can't reach blankie 
you gonna go find blankie and bring him home 
okay let me put it back on for you 
you hafta hold onto it 
be gentle with it don't hurt it 
what do you say into your microphone 
hello 
you 
what's new 
can you say hi Amanda 
should we keep reading 
gentle with that okay 
suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice 
she sang a song she had written just for Eric 
it was Ariel's special gift to him 
hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up 
it can't be he said I must be hearing the sounds of the wind 
still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song filling the night air 
when the song was over Eric looked down across the sea 
he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him 
who are you he called but all he heard was the echo of his own voice 
I'll be back soon Ariel whispered 
just wait and see 
okay 
whatever could be keeping the dwarves said Snow White 
it's getting late 
and they should be home from the diamond mine by now 
while she waited Snow White busied herself tidying up the cottage in the woods 
what messy little fellows she said 
just then Happy came through the front door 
he tugged on Snow White's long yellow skirt 
what 
Snow White he said come quickly a young deer is hurt in the woods 
oh no cried Snow White the poor thing we must hurry 
they soon reached a small clearing and everyone stood in a circle around the deer 
do you know what the dwarves' names are 
well I think there's Happy 
and there's Grumpy he looks Grumpy right 
and that's Dopey 
and that's Sneezy he's always sneezing 
that's Doc he's the doctor 
and there's Bashful 
and there's Sleepy I think 
is so sleepy sleepy 
he is yawning cause he's so tired 
to take a nap he's so tired 
he must be cold said Snow White covering the deer with her long cape 
maybe he's just tired said Sleepy yawning 
a nice long rest should do the trick 
mommy's yawning too 
 
well you could be right Sleepy said Snow White but 
he's not closing eyes 
and that's Dopey right 
yeah 
maybe he has a hachoo a cold said Sneezy 
he looks like he might be a little bit stuffy 
well that's possible but he probably would've stayed in his thicket until he was feeling better said Snow White 
I know said Happy maybe he's feeling sad and needs a little cheering up 
I'm sure that would help Happy but it looks like he may need something more than a merry story or a song 
I I don't know for sure said Bashful softly 
but perhaps he's too shy to let us know what's the matter 
we all feel shy sometimes don't we Bashful said Snow White 
then Dopey started pacing back and forth and pointing over his shoulder 
hm said Snow White you could be right Dopey 
he could be lost 
I bet I know what happened grumbled Grumpy 
the wicked queen probably cast a spell on him 
she's always up to no good 
suddenly Doc pushed his way past the others and approached the deer 
may I lake a took 
I mean take a look he said adjusting his eye glasses 
and he knelt down beside the deer 
well would you look at that cried Doc 
the poor deer must have stepped on a 
a thorn ouch 
Doc gently removed the sharp thorn and the deer jumped up and licked him 
how relieved you must be cried Snow White 
now run along home she said to her new friend your family must be worried 
the deer licked Snow White's hand and ran into the forest 
that's the deer 
oh uh the bushes you mean 
yeah 
that's the deer's ear 
this is 
that's just the sky 
the sky see there's a bush there and then the 
that's a little piece of sky 
right 
I'm so proud of each and every one of you 
the sky is on him 
oh no 
he's got 
that night Snow White and the seven dwarves made a delicious dinner 
then when they had all had their fill they sang and dances until it was time for bed 
yey 
oh what's this one about 
it's about Jasmine and what's his name 
Aladdin 
Aladdin and Jasmine had just gotten married 
people had come from near and far to celebrate 
it had been the largest wedding in the history of Agraba 
now Aladdin and Jasmine were preparing to take a trip far far away 
Abu stay out of those bags warned Aladdin smiling at his curious little friend 
that food is for our trip 
Jasmine's going to be so surprised when she sees what I've planned 
she has lived most of her life within the walls of this palace and now we are going to see the world together 
soon Aladdin and Jasmine stood on the balcony ready to begin their adventure 
the magic carpet awaits you said Aladdin 
you're going to see things you've never seen before a whole new exciting world Aladdin replied 
let's get going said Jasmine I can't wait 
Jasmine Aladdin and Abu settled on the magic carpet 
then they took off soaring high above the palace 
Jasmine laughed with delight the wind blowing her long hair behind her 
look how small everything looks she said 
it's like a dream 
after a little while the magic carpet began its descent 
are we there asked Jasmine 
almost said Aladdin 
close your eyes I want this to be a surprise 
suddenly the magic carpet landed on top of a high cliff and Jasmine heard a noise that sounded like crashing water 
oh what is it 
it's water it's the ocean 
Jasmine couldn't believe her eyes she'd never seen anything so beautiful 
the water was a brilliant shade of turquoise and dolphins leapt in and out of the water as if they were dancing 
huge ocean waves crashed onto a white sandy beach 
she have a skirt on 
we see the ocean when we were with Tamar and Rafi on the beach 
yeah and we saw the crashing waves 
we saw waves 
another wave and 
what kind of birds were we chasing on the beach 
seagulls you're right 
they flew away we didn't catch them 
right 
and did we play on the beach too 
yeah and did we go to the library with Tamar 
that was fun wasn't it 
hm 
they had a wonderful time swimming and enjoying the sun and 
when he and Jasmine were ready to go Aladdin snapped his fingers 
time for our next destination he said 
within seconds the magic carpet appeared 
once again Aladdin asked Jasmine to cover her eyes as they descended Jasmine felt the air grow colder 
okay Jasmine you can open your eyes now 
what did they see 
snow 
what is it Jasmine asked bending down to touch the cold white powder 
it's snow answered Aladdin isn't it wonderful 
it falls from the sky when it's cold 
it's amazing cried Jasmine it looks like a soft white cloud 
watch out she called Abu had thrown a snowball and it was headed straight for Aladdin 
they spent the rest of the day playing in the snow and built snowmen and made snowangels 
they even used the magic carpet as a sled to slide down a nearby hill 
soon the sun began to set and the air grew tolder colder 
I think it's time to take off said Aladdin 
you show me places so different from Agraba 
there are plenty of brand new worlds for us to share said Jasmine 
and as they made their way back to the palace Jasmine smiled 
she knew this was just the beginning of their wonderful life together 
time to go right it was getting late 
need to go to sleep right 
I hope they ate their dinner already 
and they danced too 
and 
is that what you do before you go to bed you dance

you got a leaf in your hair 
who did
