kay  Franklin's class trip  
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes  
he had gone with his class to the bakery  the fire station  and the pet store  
today  Franklin's class was going to the museum  
Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast  
the museum had lotsof steps and huge doors  
wow said Franklin  it's big  
it has to be  said Beaver  there are real dinosaurs in there  
do you remember in New York we went with grandma and grandpa to the museum with the dinosaurs  
yeah  that's called the museum of natural history in NewYork  
Beaver had been to the museum before  she knew everything about it  
big dinosaurs  she emphasized  
so big that they ate trees for breakfast  
Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch  
Franklin sat down on the steps  
what's wrong  asked Snail  
Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum  
Snail looked alarmed  
that sounds scary  
and Franklin nodded  
we're not gonna get that  
in the museum lobby  MisterOwl went over the rules  
no shouting  no running  and stay with the group  
MisterOwl said  Beaver  one more thing  
watch out for the dinosaurs  
Moose and Bear laughed  
but Franklin didn't  he moved a little closer to MisterOwl  
their first stop was the bat cave  
it was dark inside  
squeaks and squawks filled the air  
what's that  asked Franklin  
Beaver giggled  
that's the sound bats make to find their way around  
Franklin was relieved that it was bats  and not dinosaurs  
the class visited the rainforest next  
Franklin climbed high into a tree house  
he could see the tops of trees  
can you spot any dinosaurs  asked Snail  
Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly  
there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs  
in the medieval room  Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight  
we saw knights in the other museum in NewYork  at the Metropolitan  right  
yeah  
Franklin even got to dig in a sandy pit  
he was the first one to find an arrow head  
it was just like being a real archaeologist  
wow that's neat  
an archaeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things  
yeah  
the best part is still to come  said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria  
yes agreed Bear  lunch  
MisterOwl smiled  I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit  
Franklin gulped  I'm too tired to see more  I think I'll stay here a while  he muttered  
me too  said Snail  
you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs  said MisterOwl  
eat up and let's go  
reluctantly  Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long  leafy corridor  
there was a loud roar  
the floor shook and so did Franklin  
ah  
screamed Franklin when he turned the corner  
he was looking right into the bony mouth of a tyrannosaurus  
Franklin blinked  
they're bones  
real dinosaur bones  
but the dinosaurs aren't even alive  
alive giggled Beaver  of course not  
there hasn't been a live dinosaur for millions of years  
you sure make good jokes  Franklin  
you sure do  said Snail  
as they were leaving  Franklin and his friends walked past the egyp 
next time  said Beaver  you should visit the tomb  there's a mummy inside  
is it real  asked Franklin  
yeah  and it's scary  said Beaver  
but Franklin wasn't scared  
he had a mummy at home  
and he har  could hardly wait to tell her all about his adventures at the museum  
yay  
can I try one of your cherries  
are they good  
 
sure I can  
let's see what we have  
 
let's try these  
Auntie gave us these books too and I don't think we've read them yet  
Maisy 
okay  can I have another cherry  
thank you very much  
mm  tasty  
mm  it's Maisy's bath time  
she runs the water and puts in some bubbles  
and in goes duck  
ding dong  
oh  that's the door bell  
Maisy runs downstairs to see who it is  who do you think's at the door  
oh Tallulah  you're right  hello Tallulah  
Maisy can't play now  it's her bath time  
what's Tallulah holding  
a tennis racket  you're right  
Maisy runs back upstairs and gets undressed  
what's Maisy wearing  
underpants  wow  
Maisy jumps into the bubbly bath  
ding dong  
who's ringing the doorbell now  who do you think it is  
 
come and play later  
oh  where are you going  Tallulah  
where's Mai 
she's going upstairs  
Tallulah runs up to the bathroom and takes off her clothes  
splash splash  Maisy and Tallulah play in the tub  
hooray  
I did  
and the bathtub  oh the last page where it has all the pictures of Maisy  
wow  
sure  
do you wanna read this one  or this one  
this one  
Maisy's bedtime  
Maisy is sleepy  it's time for bed  
it's bedtime for Panda too  
Maisy closes her bedroom curtains  hoots the owl  
Maisy washes her face and brushes her teeth  
Maisy puts on her pajamas  
Maisy gets into bed and reads a story  
but where is Panda  
is he in the toy box  
oh  there he is  behind the curtain  
Maisy turns off the light  
but she still isn't ready to go to sleep  
hm  
 she forgot to use the potty  
wow  
Panda sits on his potty too  
look at that  
she's using the potty  
and she wears big girl underpants  
wow  
Maisy's very sleepy now  
goodnight Maisy  
goodnight Panda  
that's great
