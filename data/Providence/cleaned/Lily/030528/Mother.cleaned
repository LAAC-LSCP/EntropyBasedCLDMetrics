did we see the lion with the very big teeth  
or tiger rather  
with the big teeth  
mhm

alright where are you gonna sit that I can hold this

mhm  
mhm  
I'm just following you  
great  
this is great  
whada you looking for  
Snuffy  
which book is Snuffy  
oh Snuffy the 
oh alright  
you remember what the other animals were which was the tiger with the very big teeth  
bless you  
bless you  
saber tooth tiger and do you remember what's the thing that we saw that has a big sort of wide fork shaped horn on the front of his head  
remember  
it's in your prehistoric book  
mm it kinda looks like a hippo with a big fork on its head  
fork horn  
that's right a Brontotherium very good sweetie  
did we see anything else when we were there  
oh we saw a giant sloth you're right  
mm  
we saw a lotta dinosaurs huh  
Styracosaurus  
mhm we did see Styracosaurus  
that is true  
and remember what there was when we first walked into the museum there were three dinosaurs there was a mommy and a baby and another one  
think it was a mommy apatosaurus  
right  
and then there was the baby one too  
and there was a meat eater also  
a Carnotaur  
alright  
excellent  
okay should I read this  
Snuffy's favorite color  
okay  
 
concert day at Terrytown had been a big success  
everyone sand a song about his or her favorite color  
but Snuffy couldn't decide what his favorite color was so he sang a song about all the colors  
concert day was supersonic said Jay Jay as he flew up next to Snuffy  
your rainbow song was the best part of the show  
you must be feeling pretty good  
I am said Snuffy but everyone else picked a favorite color to sing about and I couldn't figure out my favorite color  
choosing a favorite color is one of the hardest things I'd ever tried to do  
hey Snuffy said Jay Jay I have an idea when I have trouble figuring something out I go see Brenda Blue  
that's a great idea thanks Jay Jay called Snuffy  
he headed toward Terrytown airport and Brenda Blue's workshop  
when Snuffy arrived at the workshop he found Brenda Blue working on a small motor  
hi Brenda said Snuffy hi Snuffy what's wrong asked Brenda  
I can't decide on a favorite color said Snuffy  
well it seems to me if something is your favorite color you probably see it a lot right asked Brenda  
yes said Snuffy I would probably see it every day  
and if something is your favorite you probably like it a lot too right asked Brenda  
yes said Snuffy if it's my favorite I'd really love it  
so you should figure out your favorite color based on the things you see today explained Brenda  
and pay special attention to what you love the most  
what a super idea thanks Brenda exclaimed Snuffy as he flew up into the sky  
mm  
neat  
how's that water  
mm  
the sun what's it doing  
rising you're right  
that's exactly what it's doing  
Snuffy was ready to put his plan into action so he looked at the things around him  
mm the sun above me is yellow  
maybe yellow should be my favorite color he said  
but my sky writing smoke is white and so are the clouds so maybe white should be my favorite color  
hey Snuffy called Jay Jay how's it going  
I'm still trying to choose my favorite color replied Snuffy  
wanna join me for some crock water he asked Jay Jay  
that would be great answered Snuffy  
let's go fill up our water tanks suggested Jay Jay  
there you go guys said Brenda Blue your water tanks are filled to the brim  
thanks Brenda cheered Jay Jay I don't know what we'd do without you  
you're the best agreed Snuffy come on Snuffy we have work to do said Jay Jay  
and they taxied down the runway  
Jay Jay and Snuffy arrived at farmer Dale's field  
as they sprayed water on the crops Snuffy was thinking about what his favorite color might be  
mm parts of the field are brown so maybe brown should be my favorite color  
and the corn stalks are green so maybe green should be my favorite color  
but when the corn is picked it's yellow just like the sun that's two votes for yellow so maybe that should be my favorite color  
okay Snuffy said Jay Jay we have a lot of deliveries to make we'd better head back to Terrytown airport to refuel  
back at Terrytown airport Brenda Blue filled up their gas tanks  
you guys are refueled and ready to make your deliveries she said  
thanks Brenda called Jay Jay and Snuffy as they left the airport  
boy that Brenda Blue sure is a big help said Snuffy  
no kidding agreed Jay Jay she takes good care of us  
ooh look at that  
what's that  
yeah do you know what the building is called  
right  
remember you have that book called big red barn  
sure we'll look and see if we have it we'll read it okay  
when you were a little tiny lil tiny teeny tiny girl you used to read that book all the time and you could read that book to me  
mhm  
well but you memorized the whole book cause I used to read it to you all the time and you would every time I would turn the page you would read the book  
you would recite it  
I don't know if you remember it now we'll havta look for it  
oh okay  
maybe I'll read it once and then you can read it once  
cause then you'll probably remember it  
oh alright  
while he was flying Snuffy thought to himself I love making deliveries so what colors do I see when I'm making them  
that big barn near the river is red  
maybe red should be my favorite color  
and the flowers of Smiley Meadow are purple and orange  
maybe one of those should be my favorite color  
the deliveries took them over the docks of Terrytown and Snuffy looked again for his favorite color  
wow look at those boats one's pink one's black another is gold  
maybe one of those colors is my favorite  
what are you thinking about Snuffy asked Jay Jay  
I'm still trying to figure out my favorite color  
well maybe you'll get lucky and it will come to like a flash of lightning said Jay Jay  
just then there was a flash of light and a rumbling sound in the sky  
whada you think that sound is  
thunder  
that doesn't sound good said Jay Jay  
the sky filled with clouds and the rain began to fall  
we better go home said Snuffy  
as Snuffy and Jay Jay flew back to Terrytown airport they got all wet but they knew when they arrived Brenda Blue would be waiting with a dry towel  
how are you feeling Snuffy asked Brenda as she finished drying him off  
I feel great replied Snuffy thanks  
good I wouldn't want you to get rusty she said  
okay Jay Jay it's your turn  
Snuffy moved to the hanger door and noticed a rainbow he remembered he hadn't picked a favorite color  
Brenda said I should think of something I love and that might help me choose  
and Brenda's always right thought Snuffy  
in fact Brenda's one of the most helpful people I know  
she fills our water tanks when they're empty she refuels us when we're out of gas she dries us off when we get wet and much more  
I sure do love Brenda a lot  
hey that's it said Snuffy I just figured out my favorite color  
that's great Snuffy said Jay Jay what is it not what said Snuffy who  
Blue Brenda Blue
