okay 
every day Cinderella woke up early to do chores for her stepmother and stepsisters 
from morning till night they gave her things to do 
but the birds and mice were Cinderella's friends and they helped her with her work 
one morning a messenger came from the palace to invite Cinderella and her stepsister to a royal ball 
Cinderella was very excited but her stepmother gave her a long list of chores to do before she could go 
what is she doing 
who's that 
 
you have a huge strawberry in your mouth 
while Cinderella was busy working the birds and mice began fixing an old dress that had belonged to Cinderella's mother 
before long they made Cinderella a beautiful gown 
by the time Cinderella finished her chores she thought it was too late to get ready for the ball and she was very sad 
surprise said the birds and mice and gave Cinderella the finished gown 
oh thank you so much she cried 
Cinderella got dressed and rushed to join her stepsisters but when they saw her they became jealous and tore her lovely gown to pieces 
oh 
Cinderella ran to the garden and wept just then sparkling lights swirled all around her it was her fairy godmother 
dry those tears she said you can't go to the ball looking like that 
with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a 
huh wha'd she turn the pumpkin into 
a coach and Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown 
and with one more wave Cinderella had tiny 
before she left the ball she received a warning though on the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken the fairy godmother told her and everything will be as before 
that night at the ball the prince met Cinderella without knowing each other's names they danced until the clock struck midnight 
I must go she cried but as she fled she lost a glass slipper on the staircase 
the next day the prince announced he wanted to marry the girl who had lost her glass slipper 
when the wicked stepmother realized it was Cinderella who was the prince's favorite she locked Cinderella in her room 
let me out Cinderella cried the grand duke went to every home in the kingdom looking for the maiden who's foot fit the tiny glass shoe 
Cinderella's little friends took the key out of the stepmother's pocket and slipped it under the door to Cinderella 
when the grand duke put the slipper on Cinderella's foot it fit perfectly 
soon after Cinderella and the prince were married and they lived happily ever after 
okay 
long ago there lived a lovely princess named Snow White 
her stepmother the queen was jealous of Snow White's beauty 
each day the queen would ask magic mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all 
and the mirror would always answer you are 
one day the mirror said a lovely maid I see who is more fair than thee 
the queen knew it must be Snow White 
Snow White was so beautiful and kind that even a handsome prince who was passing by noticed her 
little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow White the queen was watching 
the queen was so jealous 
Snow White realized she must leave home or risk being hurt by the queen she was so frightened that she ran deep into the forest 
do you know where I can stay she asked a group of friendly animals 
ooh what animals do you see 
there's a turtle wow 
and what else 
those are little deers right 
and what else 
bunny rabbits 
and 
djou know what this is with his little black mask 
that is a raccoon very good 
that's a raccoon and these little guys are chipmunks 
chipmunks 
the animals led Snow White to a tiny cottage in the woods 
it's like a doll's house she said 
she knocked on the door but no one answered 
so she slowly stepped inside 
Snow White found seven tiny bowls seven tiny chairs and seven tiny beds 
but the cottage was a mess oh my there must be seven tiny children living here 
let's clean the house and surprise them she said to her animal companions then maybe they'll let me stay 
that is a reindeer with his little antlers 
soon seven tiny men arrived the seven dwarfs 
Snow White promised to wash and sow and sweep for the little men and in return they kept her safe and happy 
the seven dwarfs loved having Snow White stay in their cottage 
back at the castle the magic mirror told the queen where Snow White was hiding 
the queen was so angry that she drank a potion that turned her into an old hag and she created a magic apple 
with one bite of this poisoned apple Snow White's eyes will close forever she said the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss 
as soon as the dwarfs went to work the queen disguised as a peddler woman approached Snow White the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarfs 
oh no what's Snow White doing 
right she's eating the apple 
and she fell to the floor in a deep sleep 
the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarfs raced after her 
they chased her to a rocky cliff and when a rock broke beneath her feet the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below 
the broken hearted dwarfs watched over Snow White day and night one day the prince appeared as he had been searching for the beautiful princess 
he kissed Snow White and she awakened

Sleeping Beauty 
wow should we read this 
okay 
once upon a kind king and gentle queen had a baby girl named Aurora 
visitors came to see the baby including king Hubert who ruled a nearby kingdom and his young son prince Philip 
the two kings decided that Philip and Aurora would marry one day and unite the kingdoms 
the king and queen were so happy they held a celebration 
soon three good fairies Flaura Fauna and Merryweather arrived 
they came to give magical gifts to the baby princess 
Flaura said my gift shall be the gift of beauty and Fauna said my gift shall be the gift of song 
but before Merryweather could give her gift the evil fairy Malificent appeared 
she was so angry that she hadn't been invited that she put a curse on the baby 
before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel 
Merryweather wanted to take away Malificent's curse put her powers were not strong enough 
so she changed the curse Aurora wouldn't die but would fall into a deep sleep only true love's kiss would break the spell 
then Flaura came up with a plan the three fairies would transform themselves into peasants and raise the princess deep into the forest until her sixteenth birthday 
once the curse ended they would return her to the palace 
many years passed and Malificent had lost her patience it was almost Aurora's sixteenth birthday and she hadn't found the princess 
meanwhile Aurora had grown to be sweet and lovely on her sixteenth birthday the fairies sent her out to pick berries while they prepared a surprise party 
nearby a young prince heard Aurora's pretty voice 
what's that 
that's a little squirrel 
right a little bird 
Aurora and the prince met and quickly fell in love but Aurora wouldn't tell the prince her name because the fairies had warned her to never speak to strangers 
even so she invited the prince to visit their cottage that night 
back at the cottage the fairies were having trouble making Aurora Aurora's birthday present birthday party extra special 
just as Malificent's raven was flying overhead the colorful sparklers from their magic wands shot out of the cottage's chimney 
as soon as he saw the magic the raven flew back to the forbidden mountain to tell Malificent he had found the fairies and the princess 
Aurora returned home and told the fairies about the handsome stranger she'd met the fairies explained she was a princess and was promised to prince Philip then the fairies set off to return the sad princess to her home her parents 
and her parents the king and queen 
when they reached the palace the fairies left Aurora alone while they went to find her parents suddenly a strange glow appeared 
in a trance the Princess followed the light into the room with a spinning wheel in it touch the spindle the evil fairy commanded powerless the princess obeyed and pricked her finger 
soon she feel into a deep sleep 
Malificent then found the prince and locked him in her dungeon but the good fairies appeared and they realized it was prince Philip 
they gave him the magical shield of virtue and the sword of truth 
these weapons of righteousness will triumph over evil they told him 
Malificent knew prince Philip was the only one who could undo the curse 
as he approached the castle Malificent turned herself into a terrible dragon and blasted him with hot flames 
Philip threw his sword at the dragon with all his might and the beast plunged over the edge of the cliff 
prince Philip ran through the palace gates to where Aurora lay 
he knelt beside the princess and kissed her gently 
sleeping beauty awakened and smiled at the prince
