byebye Lulu  
byebye Lulu  
byebye Lulu  
byebye Lulu  
so sorry to see you go  
okay hang on  
which one  
ah let's see  
this one is that's what friends are for do you want that one  
that one is oh oop ouch  
there's so many books in there it's hard to get out  
let me see  
really  
you want the tooth fairy book  
look what I found over here though  
the tooth fairy  
I think that's the everything book  
okay well why don't we read the tooth fairy first and then I'll hafta work on digging that other one out  
yeah  
right  
you're right  
this is the tooth fairy  
she has lotsof teeth  
she has lotsof dimes and quarters too  
she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow  
and she puts the money there instead  
sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money  
that this is because she works so hard  
the tooth fairy has to work harder than the Easter bunny because the Easter bunny only works on Easter  
the tooth fairy works harder than Santa Claus because there's only one night when Santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth fairy is busy every night  
that's Santa with a big sack of toys  
if she forgets to take your tooth one night she usually remembers it the next  
she will take your tooth home with her along with all the others she has collected that night  
when she gets home the first thing she does with your teeth is to sort them  
lower teeth extra teeth bottom teeth teeny teeth very clean teeth  
girl's teeth boy's teeth shiny teeth first teeth small teeth  
she puts some of the pretty ones in a glass jar on a high shelf in the kitchen she thinks they look nice there  
they do look nice there don't they  
pretty  
she puts some in the bottom of the fishbowl her fish are crazy about teeth too  
she makes some into necklaces and some into bracelets she has more necklaces and bracelets than anyone  
she just loves jewelry  
of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth fairy  
the pathway to her house is paved with teeth  
and there are always stars outside her window at night  
at least it looks that way because she has hung clotheslines full of teeth in the sky just in case the real stars don't come out  
well it's a pretty decoration I think  
oh really  
thank you  
I do need a little trim  
well we'll just pretend  
snip snip snip  
snip snip snip  
snip snip snip  
how does it look  
great  
wow  
oh my gosh that is so so silly  
so so silly  
let me get that phone  
you did  
yikes  
yeah that's the only ones we ever had cause you know just the little ones we got from the hospital like that size  
yeah  
sorry about that  
yeah I will look but I don't think so cause we didn't really I mean we wrapped her up for the first couple of weeks but that was the only time  
we didn't finish our tooth fairy book yet  
oh  
sorry  
each year the tooth fairy has a great big party and all the other fairies come to have refreshments and to play games  
wow  
um you know what I don't know if she's in this picture the tooth fairy  
no cause the tooth fairy has a big bow on her head  
mhm  
yeah  
that's a different fairy  
no that's a different fairy cause the tooth fairy has a big bow on her head  
here's the tooth fairy  
alright  
great  
well actually  
alright there she is  
the winner gets a prize  
there she is  
do you know why the tooth fairy likes to eat so much  
she doesn't have any of her own  
but she hopes to grow one some day  
just like you  
just like you  
yes when your baby teeth broke break you can grow a new one  
that's right  
right it will fall out and you'll get a new one  
but when you're a big girl like mommy and your tooth breaks wwhada ou havta do  
havta go to the dentist
