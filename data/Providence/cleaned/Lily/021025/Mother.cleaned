every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light 
do you remember what this rock is called 
what's it called 
it's called Pride rock 
home to my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi 
on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba 
as part of the celebration I had a special duty 
do you know what kind of animal he is 
what does he look like to you 
looks kind of like a mandrill to me 
you think so 
hm kay 
I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead 
then I lifted the future king up high for all to see 
did they talk about his name in the book 
let's see 
 
I think his name is Rafiki 
do you think so 
uh huh 
yeah what's your name 
well it's very nice to meet you 
very nice to meet you

yeah 
yeah 
and I'm sure you don't want it on tape 
yeah 
yeah 
okay I'll call you back bye 
oh hello 
not far from the ceremony in a cave at the back side of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled 
life's not fair I shall never be king 
who's this 
oh that's Scar 
who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king 
moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave 
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba 
Zazu Mufasa's trusted advisor also appeared 
you should have been first in line 
I was first in line until the little hair ball was born said Scar and he stalked out of the cave 
that's Zazu 
yeah 
before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub 
early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock 
yes Honey 
yes 
so let's stretch it out a little bit let's put it down and we'll make a crocodile okay 
all the way down very good 
then we can take all the excess away like this

you think so 
huh 
ohmygoodness

 a design 
no 
some food 
hm 
that's nice cutting Honey 
are you makin little pieces 
would you like me to read the book to you Honey 
you wanna finish Lion king or you wanna read Franklin 
alright let's see where we were 
hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride land 
of Pride rock 
my dad just showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all 
Scar looked slyly at the young cub 
he didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border did he 
well no he said I can't go there 
oh he's right said Scar it's far too dangerous 
only the bravest lions go there 
when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi 
come on I just heard about this great place he said 
the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them 
Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird 
Nala led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him 
once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala 
then Nala flipped Simba onto his back 
they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones 
Simba looked around and gasped 
this is it we made it 
before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down 
we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands he said 
and right now we're all in very real danger 
suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull 
frightened Simba Zazu and Nala jumped back 
it was Banzai his partner Shenzi and the always laughing Ed 
Banzai sneered a trio of trespassers 
Zazu tried to lead the cuds cubs to safety but Zanzai gra Banzai grabbed him by the neck and plopped him down 
the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops 
we don't want it to get stuck all over the rug right 
nope 
kay 
uh the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops 
what's the hurry we'd love you to stick around for dinner they said 
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Simba Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away 
but the hyenas weren't distracted for long 
they gave chase and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could 
finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones 
just when it looked as if it was all over for the young cubs Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw 
if you ever come near my son again he said 
the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba 
you deliberately disobeyed me I'm very disappointed in you 
Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son 
Simba peered up at his father 
I was just trying to be brave like you he said 
being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble he said 
Dad we're pail we're pals right and we'll always be together right 
Mufasa looked up at the stars 
Simba let me tell you something my father told me 
look at the stars 
the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars so whenever you feel alone just remember those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I 
do you remember where did we see stars on the ceiling 
did we go to the science museum in Boston 
and we went to that planetarium 
wasn't that neat 
yeah 
is there any Playdoh on the floor 
thank you very much 
Mommy has to go blow her nose one more time 
I'll be right back 
okay 
is there another sut oh another song coming up was that the last one 
I think it may have been 
I think perhaps so 
oh yeah 
okay Baby 
wow good luck 
that's a big job 
doo doo doo doo 
wow 
nice going Honey 
let's see 
the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge 
when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew 
you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you 
moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba 
from a distance Mufasa noticed the rising dust 
Scar appeared quickly at his side and said stampede in the gorge Simba's down there 
without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son 
Mufasa plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests 
he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and put him on a nearby ledge 
suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede 
desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which star Scar stood looking down on him 
help me Brother he said 
Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper long live the king 
and then let go of Mufasa 
ooh gotta watch that Playdoh 
Simba peered over the ridge 
ooh Sweets can you pick that up please 
no I think you can pick it up Sweetie cause you dropped it on the floor 
can you pick it up before it gets stepped on Sweetie 
alright well I'll finish reading the book when you pick your Playdoh up

doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

cause I see a piece right between us 
and I'm still waiting for you to pick it up
