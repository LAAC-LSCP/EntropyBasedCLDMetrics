okay  
all along the meadow where the cows grazed and the horses ran  there was an old 
in that wall  not far from the barn and the granary  a chatty field of 
but the farmers had moved away  the barn was abandoned  and the granary stood empty  
since winter was not far off  the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw  
is that John  
yeah  
is that Jim  
is that Mary  
maybe that's Steve  
oh that's Philip  
maybe this one's Steve  
yeah  there's Steve  he's carrying a little nut  
do you  know someone named Steve  
who's married to aunt  
they all worked day and night  all except Frederick  
Frederick  why don't you work  they asked  
I do work said feather  said Frederick  
Mommy can't talk today  
I gather sun rays for the cold dark winter days  
what are they carrying  
is that John  
when they saw Frederick sitting there staring at the meadow they said  and now  Frederick  
I gather colors answered Frederick simply  for winter is grey  
Mary  
and John and Steve  
uh  I think they're carrying some wheat  
right  it's like straw  sort of  
once Frederick seemed half asleep  
are you dreaming Frederick  they asked reproachfully  
what Sweetie  
what  
hi  
oh hi  
the winter days came and when the first snow fell the five little field mice took to their hideout in the stones  
in the beginning there was lots to eat  and the mice told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats  
yeah  
they were a happy family  
the corn was only a memory  
it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting  
aw  
well they're inside the stones of the wall  
well it's all around  that's part of the wall right here  
right here  
then they remembered what Frederick had said about sun rays and colors and words  
what about your supplies  Frederick  they asked  
close your eyes said Frederick as he climbed onto a big stone  
now I send you the rays of the sun  
do you feel how their golden glow 
and as Frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer  
was it Frederick's voice  
was it magic  
and how about the colors Frederick  they asked anxiously  
close your eyes again Frederick said  and when he told them of the blue periwinkles  the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush  they saw the colors as clearly as if they had been painted in their minds  
wow  
and the words  Frederick  
Frederick cleared his throat  and then as if from a stage he said 
who scatters the snowflakes  who melts the ice  
who spoils the  weather  who makes it 
who grows the four leaf clovers in June  
who dims the daylight  who lights the 
four little field mice who live in the sky  
four little field mice like 
one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers  then comes the summer who paints in the 
the fall mouse is next with walnuts and wheat  and winter is last  with little 
aren't we lucky the seasons are four  
think of a year with one less 
that's so great Honey  
when Frederick had finished they all applauded  
but Frederick  they said 
you are a poet  
Frederick blushed  
took a bow and said shyly 
that's great Honey  good reading
