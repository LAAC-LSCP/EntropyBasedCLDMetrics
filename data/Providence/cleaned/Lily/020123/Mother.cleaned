it's kinda hard to take seriously  
oh look honey  
a ball should make a lil green apple  
let's see what can we tell Manuela  
did it snow yesterday  
I'm sure Manuela knows that already but 
yeah a lil too well  
hm what else  
what else did we do yester I mean today  
hm  
did mommy try on dresses yesterday  
we have two weddings to go to  
and my latest here's my latest recommendation Manuela  
there's a copy called blue fly dotcom have you ever heard of that  
it's they sell all this designer stuff for like forty to seventy five percent off  
because it's last season's big whoop like who would know  
I mean like whatever how would I know I can't tell one from the next  
so I bought so I ordered six dresses from this company just to try them all on  
and their original prices were all like three hundred five hundred dollars  
and they were all a hundred to two hundred dollars  
yeah  
everything they do sweater they do jeans  
like I don't they have Earl jeans and stuff if you like  
they have um Jimmy Chew shoes I mean whatever I'm obviously not going to spend four hundred dollars on a pair of shoes but 
they have everything they have sweaters they have coats  
they have swim wear  
they have pants  
they have some home stuff not that much  
stuff for men too  
blue fly dotcom  
yeah  
I believe they do as well  
I believe they have many many bags in fact  
actually I think that came up on the opening screen last time  
oh my gosh that is the biggest pile of PlayDoh I've ever seen
