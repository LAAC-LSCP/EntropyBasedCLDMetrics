do you want to read one of your books  
look  I have the best word book ever  
and I also have what Pete ate  
which one do you wanna read  
Pete or the best word book ever  
wait until you hear the story  
it's um quirky  
to say the least  
uh  
have I got a 
I didn't think she was going to like it  
because it's a little sarcastic  
but hello  
hello there  
are you gonna help me read it  
and this is my little brother 
and this is my dog 
a good dog  
a very good dog  
but sometimes he is not so good  
and he eats what he should not  
what does he eat  
I will start with the letter a  
he ate cousin Rocky's accordion  
he ate a bouncing ball that belonged to uncle Benny's dog Buster  
Buster is no bargain he barks all the time  
but still  
he did not eat the cake from Olga  
no he ate my 
I love to take pictures  
look here's baby Mooky eating noodles  
and here's my best friend Doreen Parsley the great dancer  
he ripped the head off my dear doll Dinky  
dreadful dog  
that's Poppy Wise  
and that's Doreen  
while Doreen and I were making egg salad sandwiches for the egg head club  
Pete ran off with everything  
the egg slicer  
the egg beater  
the egg sandwich  
the common cuckoo egg  
the 
and the 
he ate a 
fez  
Fez is also a city in a country in Morocco  
on a continent called Africa  
not everyone in Fez wears a fez  
who's that  
that's Mrs Hooginschmidt  
while the twinkle twins were gluing together Mooky's halloween costume  
Pete gobbled the glue stick with gusto  
goofy gluey dog  
he ate half of my homework  
but did Mrs Hooginschmidt believe me  
ha  hardly  
she's wearing an orange coat  
and a skirt  
right maybe a dress you can't see  
under the coat  
when I turned my back for an itsy iota of time  
he ate my beautiful pink ice pop  
in a jiffy he ate twenty five 
and jumped for joy  
he ate Mooky's magic key  
the key opened Mooky's secret box  
what is inside is a secret but I will tell only you  
it's his kazoo  
at the lucky dog show he ate all the leashes  
which let loose all the dogs  
who ate all the lemon tarts  
and drank all the lemonade  
and Mrs Parsley was 
livid  
I don't wanna make a mountain out of a mole hill  
but he ate Benny's money  
holy 
mackerel  
now Benny has no money to buy Buster a new ball  
which you will remember Pete ate many letters ago  
once in a while we go to the woods  
and Pete is perfect  
then I'm at the opinion that this dog is okay  
oops we're up to p  
he ate Mrs Parsley's pink pocket book  
and she said take that Pete back to the pet shop  
and get yourself a polite pooch  
those are the twinkle twins  
poo on Mrs Parsley  
quick question  
would you love a dog who ate your lucky quarter  
a q from your alphabet collection  
and your porcupine quill  
even if for the quadrillionth time you said quit it  
don't eat that and he did  
would you still love that dog  
quite a lot  
one rainy day he ate a rubber glove  
and the rubber band necklace that Mrs Parsley wore to a meeting of the rubber band society  
Roberta Rothchild is the president of the rubber band society  
now Pete bounces around the room  
he ate Mooky's stinky sneaker for breakfast  
Doreen Parsley's sandal for lunch  
Rocky's pointy shoe from Japan for dinner  
and a soft suede slipper for a midnight snack  
the twinkle twins have a dog named Twinkie  
Twinkie may look insane  
but she does not eat their things  
Twinkie looks like she's got like sticks coming out of her fur  
they're wearing pink dresses right  
you can understand I would be unhappy to say this but 
Pete ate cousin Rocky's 
ugh  
while Mooky was playing the violin  
very badly thank you very much  
Pete ran off with the veal roast  
very angry hungry family  
those are the twinkle twins again  
in his wallet Rocky keeps a list of all the times he was insulted in his whole life  
it use to look like this  
right and now it looks like this  
wow  
when Pete eats extra crunchy extra cheesy cheese doodles  
he turns bright 
yikes  
right they were wearing pink dresses  
now they're wearing blue dresses  
my yoyo  
Doreen's yoyo  
and the yoyos of the twinkle twins  and now there will be no yoyo contest

I'm not really a big peanut butter fan  
but when forced to eat it  they have a 
Jif makes this berry blend peanut butter  
and it's really good  
just like you swallow it and instead of having that like peanutty it tastes a little bit like berry  like raspberry  
there's no jelly in it  
but it's just a little bit sweeter than regular peanut butter  
and it has that kinda like the after taste is berry  
I don't really think you can really taste it  I don't really think
