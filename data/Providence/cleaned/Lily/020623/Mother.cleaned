oh that one's upstairs how bout Franklin rides a bike 
oh thank you very much Honey 
thank you 
next to the tv where it belongs 
 
phew that was hard work 
phew 
 
 
okay Franklin rides a bike 
Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run 
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings 
but Franklin had a problem 
what was Franklin's problem 
he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels right 
right 
in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes 
Beaver was the brave one 
she practiced and practiced and then went to the park to show off 
look at me she said I can ride my bike all by myself 
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles 
who's that 
right 
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other 
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels 
we're going on a picnic said Bear come on 
Franklin was worried that his friends would make fun of his training wheels 
so he lied and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone 
aw 
poor Franklin 
what's he doing there 
is he on the slide 
he's on the swing you're right 
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike 
he wanted to ride all by himself 
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push 
Franklin w i b b l e dp and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell into the flower bed 
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again 
aw 
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out 
he watched as his friends rode off without him 
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes 
what are they doing 
what kind of ice cream are they eating 
whaddya think 
what's your favorite kind of ice cream 
do you like vanilla 
you like chocolate ice cream 
you like strawberry too 
orange I think strawberry ice cream is pink 
see I think maybe that's strawberry 
that's strawberry right 
I'm sorry to say 
maybe we can go later to get ice cream whaddya think 
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house 
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother 
I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin 
did you give it your best effort asked his mother 
hm let's see 
your granola bar has a raspberry center so maybe that's what it was 
what Sweetie 
yes 
that is delicious 
that tastes delicious right 
strawberry water 
you know what 
I love you 
I love your kisses 
I see you little blankie girl 
I see you 
there you are 
are you hiding 
well said Franklin maybe I can try one more time 
Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he said 
his mother held on to the seat 
try it I won't let you go until you tell me to 
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind 
he felt unsteady and very unsure 
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling 
riding a bike is difficult said his mother 
but you can't give up just because it's frustrating 
it's too hard for me said Franklin 
it was easy for my friends 
do you think everything comes easy for them she asked 
Franklin had to think about that 
that's a little mouse what's he doing 
Franklin went to the park 
each time she got to the third rung she fell into the sand below 
no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy 
easy for you said Beaver she tried once more and fell again 
maybe tomorrow she grumbled 
Franklin remembered when Badger learned to swim 
she was afraid to put her head underwater 
it's easy said Franklin just do it 
Badger sputtered and cried 
it took her a long time to feel good in the water 
now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other 
where is Snail 
Snail's in the other book 
Snail's at the museum right 
in the other book 
Mommy's gonna hafta get a hard candy because I can't stop coughing 
maybe that would help me stop coughing whaddya think 
you wanna pretend to eat one 
but Honey you can't really eat it because it's dangerous for a little girl to eat hard candy 
maybe you'd like something else to eat 
can you pretend with the wrapper on then 
it's gonna make your hand all sticky 
really 
no 
hello 
really 
hm 
in my mouth 
can I get you something else to eat 
hm 
there's a blue one 
looks like a blue wrapper to me 
you hafta untwist the top first Sweetie 
mhm other way 
yep just like that 
just like that like put your hand on it 
hm like that 
turn that around 
 
just like this 
just tw hang on 
good job Sweetie look 
just a twist like that 
just like that 
maybe you don't wanna hold it 
maybe you wanna put it back in the wrapper 
hm 
hm don't eat it 
Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball 
he couldn't hit the ball at all 
but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run 
who's at 
just then Porcupine came by 
she moved very slowly 
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows 
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe 
oh I think Porcupine's nice now 
don't you think Porcupine's nice 
why think the bear's mean 
yep Porcupine's nice 
Badger is nice 
and Bear is nice and Franklin is nice 
mm that's not Badger who is that 
is that Badger 
let me see 
Beaver 
what's Beaver doing 
what's Beaver playing with 
is he on the swing 
that's great 
he lined the walk with old pillows 
I'm ready to try again Franklin told his mother 
now I won't worry if I fall 
Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat 
Franklin w i b b l e dp and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell many times but he never gave up 
then it happened 
Franklin told his mother to let go 
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash 
way to go cheered his mother 
careful Honey 
Franklin was thrilled 
finally he was riding his bike all by himself 
I can do it he shouted and rode to the park to show his friends 
look at me he called 
Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over 
I think I'll work on that he laughed 
not everything is as easy at it looks 
hm where is it 
okay 
I see you licking that

at home Hilda looks for something to make her feel better 
I know when in pain ice is nice she says to herself 
that rhymes 
ice is nice 
Hilda lies down with an ice bag but her tooth is still sore 
maybe if I go to bed everything will be alright in the morning she decides 
by the next day Hilda's cheek is so swollen she decides to wear a scarf to hide it 
at snack time Lowly offers Hilda a cookie 
how sweet of you Lowly she says I love cookies 
ouch my tooth she groans 
gee have you seen your cheek Hilda it's swollen 
you should go to the dentist 
hm 
Lowly takes Hilda to Dr Rabbit's office 
Miss Molar the dental assistant welcomes them 
have a seat Hilda Dr Rabbit will see you in a minute 
I'm so frightened Lowly I hope Dr Rabbit won't hafta use the tooth drill on me 
what if you listen to music while Dr Rabbit works then you won't hear the drill 
it's time for your appointment Hilda Miss Molar says I'll be back with a radio as fast as I can Hilda says Lowly 
thank you says Hilda 
first we'll take a picture before Dr Rabbit sees you 
but I look awful Hilda says 
ha ha it's not a photograph it's an xray picture of the inside of your mouth says Miss Molar 
hm this is kinda fun says Hilda 
Dr Rabbit examines Hilda's xray 
well Hilda one of your teeth is infected but it will be as good as new after I take care of it 
what's he looking at 
that's right a picture of her teeth you're absolutely right

first I'm going to freeze your mouth so it won't hurt a bit while I fix you up Dr Rabbit says 
I don't like injections Hilda cries and pushes one of the chair's buttons 
zoom the chair goes up 
suddenly Lowly enters the dentist's office 
here I am Hilda says Lowly and here is the radio 
Hilda pushes another button and the chair goes down thump 
Lowly you're the sweetest she says I promise I'll be brave 
are you ready Hilda asked Dr Rabbit 
I guess so says Hilda 
open your mouth as wide as you can 
Hilda likes the music so much she forgets about the dentist's drill

inside the house the movers are busy setting up furniture

she's kind of spooky looking Hilda says 
in fact she looks a little like a witch 
hey what is she doing outside Billy says 
I thought she was inside 
ah the children run away as fast as they can 
later Hilda visits the hardware store 
hello Mr Frumble she says

I'd better leave before she puts a spell on me 
outside Hilda and her friends hide behind a mailbox 
they watch the new neighbor come out of the store 
what does a witch do with a cauldron asked Billy 
I bet she's going to cook up some secret potion for her magic spell says Hilda 
vroom vroom the new neighbor drives off 
the children decide to follow her back to the house 
I hope she didn't see us following her Hilda says 
or did she 
there she is again she's following us 
come on we hafta hide

Hilda opens the door

Hilda soon forgets about selling cookies and decides to try on a few costumes 
look at me she says proudly a romantic real life princess 
Hilda's having such a good time she doesn't notice it's gotten dark 
I wonder where this door leads she says and she enters an empty recording studio 
she doesn't know that her flouncy dress gets caught on a lever 
suddenly all the spotlights have go on have gone on and the cameras too
