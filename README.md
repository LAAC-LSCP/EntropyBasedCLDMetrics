# EntropyBasedCLDMetrics
Github repository accompanying the paper "Measuring language development from child-centered recordings".

- `checkpoints/` contains all the trained model (`.pt` for pytorch models and `.arpa` for [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm) language models)
- `data/` contains all the raw data used in the different experiments.
- `configs/` contains all the necessary options to train/test the models.
- `results/` contains all the csvs storing the results.
- `src/` contains all the source code.

For reproducing all the experiments, you will need to:

1) Prepare the data to train and test the models
2) Run the training
3) Run the testing
4) Reproduce the anlaysis (plots and statistical analysis of the results)
